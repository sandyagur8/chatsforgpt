undefined says I am getting this error while enabling meta transaction in my smart contract
undefined says {code: "B511", message: "Smart Contract address registered on dashboard is …b44d459ac7c382429df6e230e) in current transaction"}code: "B511"message: "Smart Contract address registered on dashboard is different than what is sent(0x5111cb3ed609b6fb44d459ac7c382429df6e230e) in current transaction"__proto__: Object
undefined says It is solved.
undefined says There was a naming difference that is why I was getting this error
undefined says Good to hear that it has been solved
undefined says Hey 
I integrate biconomy in web3 provider in my dapp but it still consumes gas
Can you tell me what i am doing wrong?
undefined says Make sure the smart contract function you are calling is registered on the developer dashboard.
undefined says Yes, I registered on biconomy dashboard using abi and contract address
undefined says Did you also add your methods under Manage APIs section on dashboard?
undefined says Yes, I added there also
undefined says and then I follow this snippet of yours
```
let bookReads = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);

bookReads.methods.addToFav(bookId).send({from: userAddress}).on("transactionHash", (hash) => {
    // Get Transaction Hash
}).once("confirmation", (confirmationCount, receipt) => {
    // Get Transaction Confirmation
}).on("error", (error)=>{
    // Error During Transaction
});

```
undefined says 1. while registering method on dashboard, did you click on native-meta tx checkbox?
2. how are you initialising web3? can you share the code here
undefined says 1. Yes i click native-meta tx
2. ```
const HDWalletProvider = require('truffle-hdwallet-provider');
const Web3 = require('web3');
import Biconomy from "@biconomy/mexa";

let web3;
let biconomy;
if(typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined') {
    web3 = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider);
}else{
    // we are in the server and matamask is not using by user
    const provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
        'https://kovan.infura.io/v3/37bd907f93a146679960d54e729cd51a'

    // web3 = new Web3(provider);
    biconomy = new Biconomy(provider,
        {
            dappId: '5e842feec1fae00bce5ab148', 
            apiKey: '1IRUtKAYa.6d5afd6e-566b-45ee-af76-1ebcb5c6bcbb'
        });
    web3 = new Web3(biconomy);
    console.log(biconomy);
}
// export default web3;
module.exports = web3
```
undefined says does your smart contract support native-metaTx? you are looking for native or contract wallet approach?
undefined says can you share your contract?
undefined says Currently, I am doing for Simple contract for testing 
and after i will use in my main contract
i take part in money legos
\
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Bakery {

  // index of created contracts

  address[] public contracts;

  // useful to know the row count in contracts index

  function getContractCount() 
    public
    view
    returns(uint contractCount)
  {
    return contracts.length;
  }

  // deploy a new contract

  function newCookie()
    public
    returns(address)
  {
    Cookie c = new Cookie();
    contracts.push(address(c));
    return address(c);
  }
}


contract Cookie {

  // suppose the deployed contract has a purpose

  function getFlavor()
    public
    view
    returns (string memory flavor)
  {
    return "mmm ... chocolate chip";
  }    
}```

}else{
//biconomy initialise
}
undefined says i think it is going in if block
undefined says thats why biconomy is not getting initialise
undefined says Okay, I am checking
undefined says its should be something like this :

let provider;

if(typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined') {
     provider = window.web3.currentProvider;
}else{
    // we are in the server and matamask is not using by user

 web3 = new Web3(biconomy);
 console.log(biconomy);
undefined says Okay, I am changing
undefined says first check your existing code
undefined says in which block its going
undefined says if or else
undefined says Yes, i checked
it is going in if block
undefined says you are right
undefined says cool
undefined says 🙂
undefined says Thank you:)
undefined says Thank you @Divya | Biconomy  for your help
it works fine:)
undefined says Great Man 😄
undefined says > I am getting this error while enabling meta transaction in my smart contract
@Yash Shah Getting this error again
undefined says No naming conflicts this time
undefined says share me screenshot of you dashboard
undefined says and also the code where you are initialising biconomy
undefined says your email with which you have registered on Biconomy ?
undefined says When will the alpha support mainnet?
undefined says We are planning to launch on mainnet  with native meta transaction support by the end of April... 
Contract Wallet Approach release on mainnet might happen in June-July...
undefined says Hi, I have developed my product
When i am going to integrate with biconomy at that my msg.sender value is changed insted of my account1 address
undefined says I am calling approve and transferFrom method
undefined says Can you tell me what i am doing wrong?
undefined says hey @sunnyrk
undefined says so biconomy provides two ways of integrating meta transactions.... 1. contract based approach and 2. native meta transaction approach

1. In contract based approach, a smart contract wallet is created for each user (on login) and while you send the transaction (be it approve or transferFrom) the transaction flow on blockchain is 
[Biconomy Relay Hub Contract] => [User Smart Contract Wallet] => [Dapp smart contract]

So here msg.sender will be user's contract wallet address and not your client account address. 
In this case you need to store your tokens in user's contract wallet address.

2. In Native meta transactions, there's no contract wallet involved but you need to get rid of msg.sender and msg.value properties from your smart contract in order for it to work by enabling native meta transactions in your smart contract.
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/#native-meta-transactions
undefined says @sunnyrk which approach are you taking?
undefined says I am following native meta transaction
undefined says I enable the api with native checkbox
undefined says ok then in that case you need to enable native meta transaction also in your smart contract..
undefined says you can check this repository to check how to enable it in your contracts
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard
undefined says Hey Thanks @Sachin | Biconomy, I inherit `EIP712MetaTransaction` in my contract and I use msgSender() method to use account address.
But I am accesing remote approve method of DAI erc20 smart contract(`0x4f96fe3b7a6cf9725f59d353f723c1bdb64ca6aa`), at that time it approves with another address of biconomy  in msg.sender instead of my contract address
undefined says ok so you want DAI gas less transfers using biconomy?
undefined says Yes, I developed wallet where it supports multiple erc20 tokens. So, we can transfer tokens to any address.
So, i did approve + transferFrom and it works. but while integrating biconomy it approve for anothe msg.sender instead my account address
undefined says ok and have you created some smart contract layer also? or just the User interface that directly communicates with these ERC20 tokens?
undefined says i use IERC20 interace and i access approve method using dai contract address
undefined says Ok so the case of DAI is different from other ERC20 tokens... coz Dai has a permit function (alternate of approve) that has native meta transaction enabled..
Lets see how you can do DAI transfer using meta transactions:
1. You call permit function using native meta transaction way, and give approval to some other address.
2. Now if you want gasless transfer also, that some other address can't be an Externally owned account (say metamask address), coz if you call transfer function using native meta tx,msg.sender would be different.
3. So you give approval using permit function to a smart contract (which you'll make), which'll a transfer function that internally calls DAI transferFrom function, so flow would be 
[Biconomy Relayer] => [Your smart contract]=> [Dai Token]
so when it check msg.sender in transferFrom function, it'll be your smart contract address which has already got approval using permit function
undefined says Now in case of other ERC20 tokens, which don't have the permit function like DAI, you have to take the Smart Contract Wallet approach, which all wallets are doing who are providing gasless transfers..
So each user first create a smart contract wallet (APIs are given in biconomy SDK for these) and transaction flow would be like
1. Transfer
[Biconomy Relay Contract] => [User smart contract wallet] => [ERC20 Token]
msg.sender in transfer function is user's smart contract wallet where tokens are stored.

No need to approve and transferFrom here, you can directly use transfer function using meta transactions
undefined says __________
The smart contract wallet approach works for DAI too
undefined says Hey guys
undefined says is there a example of using contractwallet approach without using privatekey to sign TX?
undefined says hey only differences between native meta tx and contract based approach are
1. During APIs registration on dashboard, you don't click the native meta tx check box
2. On client side, you have to add the user login module also.. check here https://docs.biconomy.io/user-login#when-you-use-third-party-wallets
undefined says once user is logged in, you can do web3 blockchain transactions usually by making your Contract instance using web3 and calling your contract methods using .call() or .send() web3 methods..

undefined says You can refer this video workshop we did few days ago..  https://youtu.be/SmCqbLaRAJI?t=4162
undefined says Hey sachin,
Can you help me with this?
I can not seem to impement eip2585

https://github.com/yashnaman/implemetation-of-EIP2585
undefined says How can we apply for a Developer Evangelist Internship?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says email to aniket@biconomy.io
undefined says Hey! I'm new to the blockchain domain and very interested in it. Can anyone recommend me some online course? I have started with the one on coursera, Blockchain Specialization. There's also one on LinkedIn learning and I'm confused between the two.
undefined says @Anubhav | Parcel can you suggest?
undefined says Hey @eshaan7  
Are you looking to build on ethereum or just blockchain in general?
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy I have sent the mail.
undefined says ok , i'll check with aniket
undefined says He will reach out to you if you profile matches the requirement.
undefined says Hi @Sachin | Biconomy, I understand mechnism of permit dai as you said for DAI Token and I developed it but i didn't got the idea about other erc20 token as you said for that in above discussion.
undefined says for this discussion: https://discordapp.com/channels/692403655474937856/692404159982338059/698437650369216603
undefined says hey @sunnyrk in other erc20 tokens, there's just approve, transfer and transferFrom methods and no permit functions right?
So in order to enable gasless transactions in those tokens, you have to take contract wallet approach of doing meta transactions..
undefined says Native meta transactions in this case wont work unless you are the owner of these ERC20 tokens and you can change the token code to enable native meta transactions in them.
undefined says hey @Sachin | Biconomy, I used contract wallet approach and I am able to biconmy login and I can get response.userContract.
but as you said for erc20 token without permit function, I can call transfer function directly right?
But at that time it takes msg.sender as response.userContract and but response.userContract has not balanece so transaction gets revert?
Can you tell me what i am doing wrong in contract wallet approach?
undefined says For doing the transactions your contract wallet needs to have balance to transfer...
undefined says In contract wallet approach, your main wallet in which user will keep his tokens and funds will be the smart contract wallet only..
undefined says Hey @Sachin | Biconomy , I am facing this error many time.
```message: "User usage has equalled the allowed limit"```
Can you tell me what i am doing wrong?
undefined says Hey @sunnyrk can you try upgrading your limit from dashboard?
undefined says okay @Tarun Gupta | Coinshift
undefined says In dapp details section you will find this section. The limit is being set by default to prevent your dapp from spam from a single user.
undefined says Okay got it
undefined says Now it works
undefined says Thank you:)
undefined says 👍
undefined says @sunnyrk btw you are testing on which network?
undefined says KOvan network
undefined says Okay
undefined says Hey, I have submitted the code of money-legos on devfolio dashboard with necessary questions & answers.
is there anything else to do?
undefined says You need to submit a PR on our mexa sdk github repo
undefined says > You need to submit a PR on our mexa sdk github repo
@Tarun Gupta | Coinshift Applicable to everyone integrating with biconomy?
undefined says Code submission guidelines:
Fork the mexa-sdk github repository.
Create a new branch and create a directory “Examples”
Push your code to your forked repo branch.

undefined says Hi, If we are using external wallet then what is the point in logging in user?
undefined says using biconomy.login
undefined says There's no point in using biconomy.login if you are using external wallets
undefined says With external wallets you'll be using native meta transactions for creating the wallets and doing transactions via that external wallets
undefined says hey guys i am working on this one https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk/issues/33
undefined says i followed the tutorials and demo but i am not able to make a contarct call to a method. So what i did was i created a dapp on https://dashboard.biconomy.io/dapp and then added smart contract and also added a contract method.
So my method is `deposit`(smart contract method) but the name of method i set on biconomy is `metaDeposit` now i am calling this method like this `const promiEvent = contract.methods.deposit(window.ethereum.selectedAddress, myParameter, nonce, r, s, v).send({ from: window.ethereum.selectedAddress });` it gives error of extra params provided(6 provided, required 1) and when i do this `contract.methods.metaDeposit...` it says `metaDeposit` is not a method
undefined says Am i calling it right?
undefined says looks like your deposit method accepts only one parameter.
undefined says Might be the case that the ABI you have registered on dashboard is not updated one.
undefined says do you have a git repo where i can check your smart contract?
undefined says also, name you can put anything, its only for readability. you need to call your contract method with actual name which is given in the smart contract.
undefined says Yes my deposit method only need one param but I saw in demo examples that we also provide params to methods like nonce, r, s, v etc so should I not provide them? @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says are your using native meta-tx in your contract?
undefined says if yes, and if you are following the steps we did on the demo, please check these few points if that can help :

1. https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/TestContract.sol like in this test contract , you need to inherit "EIP712MetaTransaction" contract in your contract. Deploy the contract again.

2. Replace the ABI and address on the dashboard.
Now, in order to call your method, you need to register "executeMetaTransaction" method on the dashboard.
undefined says 3. Call "executeMetaTransaction" method instead of deposit, with all the required params.
undefined says this should solve your issue. If you still face issue, i would suggest you to share the contract as well as the client code with us.
undefined says hey guys sorry i started late and couldn't submit this bounty on time. However i got good idea on how biconomy works and I am still interested in doing this task and the gasless txs one. By any chance are you guys considering increasing the expiration time for them?
undefined says @lukrach  the expiration date has been extended till 31st May. Looking forward to your submission 🙂
undefined says @Anubhav | Parcel AMAZING!!!💙
undefined says Hi guys, Can some explain difference between(pro and cons ) using https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/gsn  and biconomy mexa.
undefined says Hey @BTCneuron Here are some direct difference between GSN and Biconomy

*Biconomy Pros:*
- Dashboard for developers to more granular control on meta transaction usage.
- Quick 2 step integration with no extra smart contract deployments.
- No need to worry about protocol changes or new trends on blockchain. Biconomy makes sure the system is upto date with market trends.
- Less gas per transaction as no extra hops on-chain and payments are processed off-chain.
- Gas fee can be paid in stable tokens, ERC20 tokens or Fiat.

*Biconomy Cons:*
- Not decentralized, so need to trust biconomy servers for processing transaction.


*GSN Pros:*
- Decentralized system, so no need to trust any single relayer.
- GSN2 is simpler than GSN1, so comparatively easy to setup.
- Relayers can be paid in ERC20 tokens while paying back the fees.

*GSN Cons:*
- Extra setup is required.
- High relayers fees.
- Regular monitoring on DApp funds is required to repay the relayers.
- High transaction fee, as extra processing done on chain like multiple hops, checking dapp deposits, relayer payments.
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy  thanks
undefined says Hi Team, I am facing this error
```
POST https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/custom 417 
Error: Request failed with status code 417
    at createError (createError.js:16)
    at settle (settle.js:17)
    at XMLHttpRequest.handleLoad (xhr.js:61)
```
It works perfectly but sometime i am getting above error.
And if i delete that functions from biconomy dasboard and add again in biconomy dashboard then it works perfectly one or two times and then i am geting this above error again. 
i don't know what i am doing wrong
undefined says Let me check
undefined says OKay @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says Hey @sunnyrk This might be the case that you are signing transactions from a single account and before the first transaction is getting confirmed, you initiate another transaction which takes the old nonce and when you try to send transaction via biconomy, mean while transaction got confirmed and when you send it biconomy sees that signature verification is going to fail with old nonce and it gives an error....

Can you check if this is the case? as your issue is not happening always this looks like a possibility to me..
undefined says Hi @Sachin | Biconomy, i think you are right. but can you tell me what should i do then. I am sending different nonce but its not working. like,

```
          let BiconomyTxCount = await web3Biconomy.eth.getTransactionCount(biconomyAddress);
   
          let txData = await erc20ContractInstance2.methods.approve(
            routeraddress, 
            amountSwapDesired
           )
          .send({
            from: accounts[0],
            nonce: BiconomyTxCount+1
          });
```
undefined says I think you are confusing between transaction nonce and user nonce.... that's not how you should increase the nonce....
Transaction(relayer) nonce is being managed by biconomy so that's not the problem here..

Since you are using contract wallet approach, biconomy contract wallet actually supports multi dimensional nonce.. but mexa sdk by default uses batchId as 0

To solve your issues, changes needs to be done at SDK level where you send a different batchId.. 
Method #handleSendTransaction
Line # message.batchId = config.NONCE_BATCH_ID;

Since most of our clients are using native meta transaction approach, for now we are not focusing on our smart contract wallets.. this is scheduled in next quarter. 
Our sdk is open source you can try add this feature in SDK and do a PR.. i can help you in that.
undefined says Okay @Sachin | Biconomy,  what changes  i need to do in this
```
Method #handleSendTransaction
Line # message.batchId = config.NONCE_BATCH_ID;
```
undefined says Send the batchId in transaction payload from client and here instead of taking it from config, take this from payload params..   similar to 'to', 'data', 'gasLimit' etc
undefined says hi everyone, anyone facing this while testing locally?
```Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://testnetv3.matic.network/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: Redirect is not allowed for a preflight request.```
dApp is set to work with testnetV3 on dashboard

I tried same code in different project similar to demo app and its working fine. thanks!

biconomy version: 1.5.12
undefined says Are you still facing the issue?
undefined says yes, now
undefined says ```Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://testnetv3.matic.network/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header in the response is '' which must be 'true' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'. The credentials mode of requests initiated by the XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute.``` 
sorry this one is the correct, with https matic endpoint
undefined says When are you facing this error?
undefined says Fyi Matic is going to deprecate testnet3.. so you should test on Matic mumbai Testnet...
undefined says yes, I know it, will test with latest maticjs version. I wrote a test app based on this: https://suspicious-newton-8de192.netlify.app/ and it works (I mean, connecting to biconomy with mexa lib), but when implementing in a different app it doesnt work (same code), so is there any additional settings from our side? thanks
undefined says The problem with CORS policy doesn't seems to be related to mexa.. if you could share the working code of you different dapp deployed somewhere like you current one...  then it'll be easy to debug the issue..
undefined says Check our latest API for checking if gas usage limits have been reached or not, before sending meta transaction.
https://docs.biconomy.io/api/check-limits
undefined says > The problem with CORS policy doesn't seems to be related to mexa.. if you could share the working code of you different dapp deployed somewhere like you current one...  then it'll be easy to debug the issue..
@Sachin | Biconomy thanks, already solved
undefined says Great.. what was the problem?
undefined says oh, sorry for delay. mismatched imports of Web3 in js module...🤔
undefined says oh ok
undefined says Hey guys, I want to integrate Biconomy and Magic.link into our app. We want to outsource our users' keys management  to Magiclink and we want to use Biconomy as gas station. I want to keep our contracts as it is for now (if possible), so I decided to go with the contract based solution. But I couldn't set it up in our app. Can you help me setting it up?
undefined says Hey Aref
undefined says Hey Divya
undefined says For contract based solution, we support Gnosis & Argent on our dashboard. 

can you upload your smart contract on git and share with me.
undefined says Yes, let me create a gist for that
undefined says we can check and can tell you which would be the best approach for you
undefined says sure
undefined says https://gist.github.com/arefaslani/6394681d9bb63c26d8903f259af0803b
undefined says I can see you have already inherited the GSN recipient Contract, are you using GSN currently?
undefined says Ah I forgot to remove that... I was playing with it. In line 20 just replace GSNRecipient with Context.
undefined says Is there any possibility you can do changes in smart contract?
undefined says Yes if we can't keep it as it is for using Biconomy
undefined says cool
undefined says Hey guys, I changed our smart contract and implemented our front end code based on this file:
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/xdai-demo/example/react-ui/src/App.js
Now when I refresh the page to start working with the contract it shows this error (in debug mode):
```
{log: "User Contract does not exists", flag: 204}
```
But I'm sure that the contract exists. Here is the contract address: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x42196571b7Ba8Ad6fEA858C219980a936c546fC9
Also I checked this code with an old contract and when I replaced it with the new one to enable native meta transactions, it doesn't work anymore.
undefined says Can you share your front end code on git?
undefined says i need to check how you are initialising Biconomy
undefined says Sure, let me do that
undefined says https://gist.github.com/arefaslani/88e9dc20ff004e2738bdc6140a363ba2
undefined says have you uploaded your contract on Dashboard
undefined says ?
undefined says Yes
undefined says have you registered your method also?
undefined says i need screenshot
undefined says looks like you have not enable the native flag, while registering the methods in "manage API" section
undefined says Actually I was testing it before and the only problem was that I haven't changed the contract address to the new one that supports native meta transactions and it was reducing the transaction fee from the user wallet, just like a normal contract method invoking and when I changed the contract address, it didn't work anymore.
undefined says I did... Let me share a screenshot with you.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says ok this looks ok
undefined says i need to see your biconomy initialization code also
undefined says you have kept it in utilities i guess

import biconomy from "utilities/biconomy";
undefined says https://gist.github.com/arefaslani/c62c2c49fd2a6dd3134b8ba29c30f67b
undefined says (I'll change credentials after we fixed it)
undefined says And here is how I call it: https://gist.github.com/arefaslani/43168d993aa93a753e1076dcfc08bb69
undefined says can we have a quick call?
undefined says Yeah sure
undefined says let me share the call link
undefined says Fine
undefined says Hey @Deleted User 

I have Created a Demo to showcase **Magic + Biconomy** integration with license.rock contract.
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/tree/license-rock-demo

to run this code, all you have to do is
1. Take this branch, 
2. Go to examples/react-ui
3. npm install
4. Add your Magic-key in this file
/example/react-ui/src/App.js
5. npm run start
undefined says Great! Thanks for the help and great support. Wish tons of success for your business 🙂
undefined says 😄 Bless you too Sir
undefined says Hello guys! I was wondering if there's a example repository with biconomy + gnosis contract proxy kit ( I am trying to develop a dApp with that stack but haven't been able to achieve it -_yet_-)
undefined says Hello guys! I was wondering where I can get the `dAppId` from?
undefined says I can not see it in the dashboard
undefined says Hey Cesar, why are you looking for a dappId in dashboard?
undefined says the documentation says that it's there
undefined says am I missing something?
undefined says from where you are referring to? is it from github?
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/configuration#dappid
undefined says Ohh dapp id is not required in the latest sdk version. we will update it on docs
undefined says okok
undefined says thank you
undefined says only api-key is required and other params are optional
undefined says by any chance do you have an example of a project that uses gnosis proxy with biconomy?
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy can help with this query.
undefined says 🙏🏻 and thanks for helping me sir, hopefully he answers
undefined says No worries. we will get back to you asap.
undefined says Hey @Cesar , nice to meet you.

Yeah, we have a demo created where we have integrated gnosis proxy safe with the Biconomy.
https://github.com/bcnmy/wallet-integrations/tree/master/gnosis

there are two branches
master : erc20 transfer using gnosis safe via biconomy
Eth-Transfer : Eth transfer using gnosis safe via biconomy
undefined says FYI, this is not gnosis cpk. Integration with gnosis cpk in Biconomy sdk is in our roadmap but right now we have given support for Gnosis proxy safe contracts only.
undefined says > https://docs.biconomy.io/configuration#dappid
@Cesar Thanks for pointing this. This is not required anymore. Let me remove it from the Docs also.
undefined says Thank you for the answer @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says Just to make sure: I am using the `contract-proxy-kit` library, which uses under the hood those contracts. That means I wont be able to use biconomy with it right?
undefined says In order to use it, i'd need to interact with the contracts directly?
undefined says Correct
undefined says Integrating contract-proxy-kit (CPK) is under development. But for now please go ahead with contracts.
undefined says All right - Thank you for letting me know 🙏
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy I need to add GnosisSafe as a SCW and the GnosisProxy as a SC in the biconomy dashboard, right? Also, if I want to batch tx with `multiSend` contract I'd need to add it as a SC?
undefined says This is gnosis safe, which will be added under SCW, it has executeTransaction method in it.Eventually this will be the gnosis proxy wallet. This will be used to send users transactions.
https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/development/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol

This is GnosisProxyFactory, which will be registered under SC. this has createProxy method, which will be used to create user's proxy wallet.
https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/development/contracts/proxies/GnosisSafeProxyFactory.sol
undefined says choose accordingly 🙂
undefined says Exactly
undefined says Awesome
undefined says And, this is MultiSend, which will be registered under SC too. it has the `multiSend` method and will be user to batch txs
https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/025a11498043e6c0f741f2ac2c079ab4a76d578c/contracts/libraries/MultiSend.sol

Does this makes sense to you?
undefined says TBH i have never used it. But that shouldn't be a problem as we are only relaying the transaction.
Will you be able it try it out and let Me also know the result.
undefined says Okok - Sure! And sorry for the spam 😛
undefined says lol, i am excited to see your outcome when you use multiSent.
I was planning to try this for so long but not able to do that because of other stuff.
undefined says Hello... Can anbody help me?
undefined says I sent BTC to curve LP Pool. But that BTC did't go into the LP Pool. I didn't get confirm sign message. How can I get confirm Sign message again?
undefined says Hey @wise when did you do the transaction?
undefined says Hi everybody, we were wondering if all destinations address need to be whitelisted? We participating in the Hackerthon and want to enable community members to send tx, which for we pay the fees. According to this
https://docs.biconomy.io/api/whitelist-api/whitelist-proxy-contracts 
The proxy address as well as the destination address need to be whitelisted.
undefined says Hey @marv are you using gnosis samart contract wallets?
undefined says Yes we are using gnosis smart contract wallet
undefined says getting a gas estimation error when using mexa sdk... can someone help ?
undefined says Hey hi
undefined says Can you show me the screenshot
undefined says yeah. will share it now
undefined says https://gist.github.com/rahuldamodar94/e2510c1742ae6e8018fd23d9ad307d35
undefined says this is the code
undefined says 
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy i am from the matic team...  the contract i am using is on mumbai and it is native meta tx enabled...
undefined says i tried to execute the function directly... it worked... but with the mexasdk, there is this error.
undefined says i need to see your contract too
undefined says can you share that?
undefined says https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildERC20.sol
undefined says exactly the same
undefined says i have done meta tx on this same contract address and it has worked before... this time i am doing with the mexa sdk.. that is the only difference.
undefined says the error clearly denotes that it is a contract error... but i am actually having balance.. and the tx does go through when i do a normal web3 call..
undefined says also.. i dont get popup in metamask.. this is the first big problem .
undefined says ok, so you are calling the withdraw method directly, which has _msgSender(), which will return the address of the relayer. Hence the error is coming,

You need to call the executeMetaTransaction() method, and pass the withdraw method in functionSignature as a param, in this way, the _msgSender() of ContextMixin will be called and it will fetch your address instead of relayers.
undefined says here it is going in the ELSE part. It should go into IF block
undefined says do you have an example usage of this ?
undefined says i thought this is implicitly handled in the mexa sdk.
undefined says so any function that i need to call, i should be calling the executeMetatransactionFunction ?
undefined says yes
undefined says exactly
undefined says > i thought this is implicitly handled in the mexa sdk.
@RahulD94 yeah, we are planning to do something similar, but its not there right now
undefined says ok. if you can send me an example how you set the params for executeMetaTransaction for any given contract function .. it would be easy.
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/tree/mumbai-demo

check this repo, its a simple demo created on mumbai
undefined says ok/. coo.. thanks
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy running that repo gave two popups.one for the signature and then again for paying the gas..
undefined says but that is not the expected behaviour right ?
undefined says Ohh, yeah, please change the project web3 version to 1.2.5-rc.0
undefined says Please uninstall the earlier version first, delete the lock file
undefined says Then install this new version
undefined says ok. let me try then
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy the web3 version is at "web3": "^1.2.5-rc.0" already
undefined says Can you share the logs with me from browser console?
undefined says i was on the master branch initially... now when i switched over to the mumbai-demo branch , it says "please enter the quote whenever i click submit"
undefined says Is your network on metamask is correct?
undefined says yup. i am on mumbai network.
undefined says Please refresh once and try
undefined says M checking from my end too
undefined says {log: "Not a valid registered dapp", flag: 144}
flag: 144
log: "Not a valid registered dapp"
__proto__: Object
undefined says in the browser..
undefined says Cool
undefined says Wait for 5 min
undefined says something with the biconomy api key in the demo project i guess
undefined says contract is being initialised inside biconomy.READY event..
undefined says since contract is not being initialised, i get please enter a quote..
undefined says ok.. will wait. do let me know
undefined says Yeah, the dapp or the contract from the dashboard might have been removed.
undefined says api-key: hAKAX4JWL.bb10ca56-ba5d-47e9-850d-a855372e9288
undefined says can you use this one and try?
undefined says yeah. tried.. but again metamask pops up twice
undefined says once for the sign
undefined says and then for paying gas
undefined says 😦
undefined says logs still same?
undefined says there is no error..
undefined says the tx went through
undefined says and this is my web3 in package.json
undefined says "web3": "^1.2.5-rc.0"
undefined says strange. Give me some time, i'll running this same code on my local. Sorry for inconvenience
undefined says yeah. not a problem. but please try to resolve this today. a little urgent..
undefined says yeah , doing this now
undefined says after changing my api-key, i am able to send the transaction through Biconomy
undefined says ok. i see.. then why does it ask me to pay gas..
undefined says i am running the same code ..
undefined says and using the same API key as you sent me
undefined says can we have a quick call?
undefined says yeah. sure
undefined says let me share you the link
undefined says i have DM's you now
undefined says > Yes we are using gnosis smart contract wallet
@marv Yes you need to whitelist both destination and gnosis proxy wallets to avoid anyone from misusing your API Key and do some arbitrary txn via gnosis wallet.
undefined says Is it possible to use DAI?
undefined says We are on rinkeby
undefined says Can you elaborate on how you are using DAI in terms of Biconomy?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy We want to use DAI as medium of exchange within a closed community
undefined says yeah you can use DAI using biconomy as it supports permit function using native meta transaction already..
undefined says Hello. What needs to be added to a contract to make it compatible with meta tx's? Is there a contract it can inherit from like GSN's ``GSNRecipient``?
undefined says Hey, yes. Checkout our basicSignature contract which you can inherit to enable native meta-tx
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/tree/basic-signature-metatx/src/contracts
undefined says This repo has our demo code, which you can pull and play around.

In example/react-ui folder, there is our script.
undefined says Okay, so its just inherit from ``./EIP712MetaTransaction.sol`` and pass in the contract name and version into its constructor
undefined says ``msgSender()`` function is safe like in OpenZeppelin's Context library?
undefined says Yes contract is safe and audited
undefined says Was wondering, since I would't be able to use context's _msgSender() etc, but I guess with the meta tx it is sanitised as well
undefined says So we have two contracts 
EIP712MetaTransaction, which supports EIP712 signatures

And BasicMetaTransaction, which supports personal_sign  signature
undefined says > Was wondering, since I would't be able to use context's _msgSender() etc, but I guess with the meta tx it is sanitised as well
@0xjimmy yeah both GSN and our implementation of msgSender is similar and does the same work..
undefined says How do payments for fees work?
undefined says Thats all done offchain via the dashboard?
undefined says So we pay the Gas fee upfront and we maintain the relayer balances and after a month of usage we recover subscription + Gas fee from developers offchain...
undefined says Yeah keeping payments offchain allow us to reduce Gas overhead in each meta txn..
undefined says That sounds great, I'll test it out on a testnet and I belive we will use this service when our product goes live.
undefined says Awesome. 👍
undefined says ```js
const web3Provider = new Web3(window.ethereum)
const biconomy = new Biconomy(web3Provider, { apiKey })
web3 = new Web3(biconomy)

biconomy.onEvent(biconomy.READY, async () => {
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address)
  await contract.methods
    .safeTransferFrom(/* params */)
    .send({ from: window.ethereum.selectedAddress })
})
```
undefined says I've set this up, but I still get a prompt to sign a transaction, not the meta tx reciept
undefined says Do I need to contruct all the signiture functions manually? So @biconomy/mexa is just a wrapper to send the transaction API requests?
undefined says Any Biconomy dev/team available to dm or call?
undefined says > ```js
> const web3Provider = new Web3(window.ethereum)
> const biconomy = new Biconomy(web3Provider, { apiKey })
> web3 = new Web3(biconomy)
> 
> biconomy.onEvent(biconomy.READY, async () => {

> })
> ```
@0xjimmy  can you tell me your projects web3 version?
undefined says 1.3.0 @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says Please uninstall this and install this version 1.2.5-rc.0 explicitly
undefined says Okay, is the code I sent supposed to work as is, for meta tx?
undefined says I've been looking on examples on Github and none use @biconomy/mexa and all use different methods for the signing and sending of the tx
undefined says Yes, the code looks good to me.

The web3 version 1.3.0 has some issue, hence we have facing some issue while using it with our sdk
undefined says Ohh let me share the repo with you.
undefined says Do you support Ethers yet?
undefined says No
undefined says If you are using ethers.js then sdk won't work. Instead you can use our api directly in that case
undefined says web3 is fine 🙂 Thanks
undefined says Cool, do you want me to share the demo repo with you?
undefined says Sure if you can
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/tree/basic-signature-metatx

Just cross check the web3 version here also.
undefined says It requires those signing functions as well as the mexa package? @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says Yes i suppose
undefined says https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/native this api call is failing for me now
was working fine till yesterday..
i checked the limit in biconomy dashboard... its 10 per dapp .. 10 per user.. so.. it should actually work right ?
also tried changing the api key ..
the api call goes into a pending state and finally fails .
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy @Divya | Biconomy please look into this, when you are free.
undefined says Yes yes, for sure👍
undefined says Hey @everyone , we are seeing issue with transactions on mumbai network. We are checking the issue. 
Please bear with us. 
Thanks.
undefined says Hello @everyone , Matic Mumbai issue is resolved. 🙂 Please continue with your integration.
Thanks for the support 🙏
undefined says ```
{
  "code": 3,
  "message": "execution reverted: Signer and signature do not match",
  ...
}
```
undefined says I am getting this error
undefined says I cannot get the correct signiture
undefined says @Ahmed Al-Balaghi
undefined says ```js
const userAddress = window.ethereum.selectedAddress
const nonce = await contract.methods.getNonce(userAddress).call()
const functionSignature = contract.methods
      .mint(userAddress, 0, 420, "0x")
      .encodeABI()
const messageToSign = constructMetaTransactionMessage(
  nonce,
  80001,
  functionSignature,
  contractConfig.address
)
const signature = await web3.eth.sign(
  "0x" + messageToSign.toString("hex"),
  userAddress
)
const { r, s, v } = getSignatureParameters(signature)
sendTransaction(userAddress, functionSignature, r, s, v)
```
undefined says On contract, you are inhereting BasicMetaTrasaction.sol?
undefined says Also use web3.eth.personal.sign to get the signature
undefined says Yes I inherit ``EIP712MetaTransaction``
undefined says Oh if you inherit EIP712MetaTransaction then you should take EIP712 signature from client side too
undefined says Check the code here
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/mumbai-demo/example/react-ui/src/App.js
undefined says This?
```js
      const dataToSign = JSON.stringify({
          types: {
            EIP712Domain: domainType,
            MetaTransaction: metaTransactionType
          },
          domain: domainData,
          primaryType: "MetaTransaction",
          message: message
        });
        web3.currentProvider.send(
          {
            jsonrpc: "2.0",
            id: 999999999999,
            method: "eth_signTypedData_v4",
            params: [userAddress, dataToSign]
     })
```
undefined says Yes
undefined says Okay, I'll have a try. I find the documentation not to be the most consistant
undefined says hey @0xjimmy sorry for the inconvenience, can you tell which part of the documentation was not consistent so that we can improve that part?
undefined says Also what use case are you trying to implement using meta txn?
undefined says Just to pay gas fees for users. @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says @0xjimmy let me know if you were able to do the biconomy integration or if you are have any queries
undefined says Hi! When sending a metatrasaction (signed on Goerli to a Matic Mumbai contract) I'm getting the error `Error while gas estimation with message Returned error: execution reverted: Signer and signature do not match`

In order to debug I'm setting the gas limit with `gasLimit`, and I see it being sent to the Mexa API:
```
let tx = await contract.methods
          .executeMetaTransaction(userAddress, functionSignature, r, s, v)
          .send({
            from: userAddress,
            gasLimit: 700000
          });
```

But I still get the same `gas estimation` error. Why could that be?
undefined says This error is due to mismatch in signature parameters on client side and smart contract.... 
What's the data you are signing on client side? Can you share it?
undefined says Thank you Sachin, I was able to fix it finding the proper structure for the typed data
undefined says how do i get access to the ethereum  mainnet ??
undefined says i can arrange a call with you and the team.
undefined says Hello guys, I've forked a repo - https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa, and trying to execute tests
npx hardhat test
undefined says getting an error -   1) Biconomy Forwarder
       "before all" hook in "Biconomy Forwarder":
     ProviderError: Must be authenticated!
undefined says seems to be - an account wasn't found to sign & deploy trx
undefined says .secret - exists with correct phrase
undefined says .infura - also
undefined says what else is needed ?
undefined says The config might be set to use Alchemy
undefined says url:`https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/${alchemyKey}` } },
undefined says Go to hardhat.config.js and comment out line 53 and un comment line 52...
undefined says Let me know if that works :)
undefined says thanks ! Just registered at https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/ and got an API key
undefined says the score is  
32 passing (17s)
 9 failing
undefined says Which 9, send a screenshot please
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says It appears all these tests are failing because there is an error either registering , encoding or decoding the domain separator...

Super weird, will look into it when I get time
undefined says maybe smth connected with my laptop / npm modules / etc..
undefined says Yeah, could be... Did you run npm install
undefined says of course
undefined says If you opened the code in your ide, check it didn't add any require statements (VS Code does that, I hate it lol)
undefined says seems to be everything OK - git diff shows only new added files
undefined says I see, I'll get back to you soon
undefined says Just to confirm, you cloned the master branch?
undefined says git show
commit 7a5e6e20d57b19b4b2695c0b6b4399c5f46da4fa (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: Sachin Tomar <sachin.arox@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 2 02:46:57 2020 +0530
undefined says And one more question, please.
The following set of contracts has been deployed to testnet
 - RelayerManager
 - ImplementationLogic
 - ProxyManager
 - RelayHub

There is a hello-world contract, with some function -  "hello".
I wanna execute "hello" and pay trx fee from some relayer account

Without doing inheritance from BaseMetaTrxContract and DAPP registration.
Can someone describe correct sequence of calls ?
undefined says I mean smth like
1) Add relayer via function addRelayer(address relayerAddress) public onlyOwner 
2) Pack and Sign "Hello" trx
3) Forward trx via function forward(
etc...
undefined says The documentation is quite clear related to DAPP registration, API key. But doing it manually - encounter some difficulties..
undefined says Hey @pb The RelayerManager, RelayHub and other set of contracts  in the https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/tree/master/contracts/5 repository are deprecated as we are now using EIP-2771 standard for implementing meta transactions.. 
The RelayHub contract approach was used to do meta transaction via a Contract Wallet IdentityProxy.sol

But still since you asked, here is the flow used by that approach..
1. Add relayer via function addRelayer in RelayHub.sol
2. Create a smart contract wallet for user by calling createIdentityProxy() method of RelayHub.sol
3. Call RelayHub.sol foward method using your relayer by passing required parameters, including encoded "Hello" function data..
And to create the signatures on client side you can checkout this part in the sdk https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk/blob/master/src/index.js#L681
undefined says Hey @Sachin | Biconomy , thanks for detailed answer ! Do you have a shared github repo, demonstrating your implementation of meta transactions w.r.t. EIP-2771 standard ?
undefined says Hey we are writing documentation around that as we speak.. we'll soon roll it out in a week's time with support in SDK, API and dashboard...

But to give you the idea..
1. First you have to make your contracts EIP2771 compatible and set the trustedForwarder address 
2. You can find the TrustedForwarder implementation here with support of EIP712 signature and personal signature https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/blob/master/contracts/6/forwarder/BiconomyForwarder.sol
Note: This is not final commit.
3. Then your transaction flow would be like this..

End User sign transaction params -> Relayer -> TrustedForwarder( executeEIP712() or executePersonalSign()) -> Your Hello function call (via call() method)

You can find client side implementation without using Biconomy SDK here, https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/forwarder-metatx-api/example/react-ui/src/App.js

Although using Biconomy SDK it'll be much easy for you to send the transaction as we've abstracted most of the technical interface.
undefined says Hello there 🙂 I'm reading Biconomy doc but I can't really understand if I have to extend any specific contract for the transaction to go through or if it works out of the box because you use a signed transaction and not some _msgSender() / _msgData()
undefined says I would love to see several example as github projects to understand
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/dapp-demo in this it seems there is nothing to be done on the contract, but it's a bit old and the readme doesn't really tell what this is and how this work
undefined says Hey @dievardump you can checkout this repo
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/tree/mumbai-demo
undefined says Ah that's the one I remembered from the Matic tg, that's why I was unsure about the Quote contract
undefined says So process is 
1. You inherit EIP712MetaTransaction.sol contract.
2. Replace msg.sender with msgSender() method inherited from EIP712MetaTransaction.sol
3. From the client side, you call executeMetaTransaction method (pass your target  function signature as a parameter to this function, along with user signature)
undefined says Yep seems very straightforward, thank you
undefined says Happy New Year! We are very close to completing our integration, everything is functional except for executing meta transactions with dynamic types, such as `string` -- we think this is specifically coming from the `abi.encodePacked`  in the metatx-standard contracts: https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/mumbai-demo/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol#L38

When executing the transaction, the parameters aren't being passed/packed as expected. For example, here's a good tx (you can see the strings being passed in UTF-8): https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/tx/0xc37732fa397abc0bebaea66383524e626a31a6a7d0cdc71a70092a42e544ac56/internal-transactions

Here's a bad tx, the strings are packed, but there appears to be a lot of extra in the beginning: https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/tx/0x59c71404333eb29f718f7be68ed6b1390492fec5328e32cbeb27090fa72b6acc/internal-transactions

Does anyone know of a way to make dynamic types work with this type of metatx call?
undefined says Hey @alecw there'll be the difference in the data, as different functions are being called in both cases...

In your first transaction, you are calling your method directly, the first 4 bytes are your function selector 0xa411ef20

In second transaction, the function you are calling is executeMetaTransaction whose function selector will be different, hence first 4 bytes are different which are 0x0c53c51c

but if you see the data further, executeMetaTransaction takes the actual method signature as second parameter, so you can see your original function signature 0xa411ef20 somewhere in the middle of the data... 

0x0c53c51c0000000........0000000e4**0xa411ef20**000000000000000.......
undefined says Thanks for your insights @Sachin | Biconomy , that clears up a lot and validates what we were thinking. We ended up getting everything working a few minutes ago using the metatx-standard contract on the main branch -- the one in the `mumbai-demo` was giving some issues.

We're fully integrated with Biconomy now! btw, really awesome system. We're looking forward to future updates!!
undefined says Thanks @alecw
undefined says hey guys, do you have any documentation on how to implement your metatransactions if we are using an upgradeable pattern?
undefined says so basically a version of this https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol that has an initalise function instead of a constructor. i am too scared to try and make the changes myself 😛
undefined says Hey you can refer to this repository https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/tree/master/contracts/common
and check NativeMetaTransaciton.sol and EIP712Base.sol

So basically, NativeMetaTransaciton.sol is equivalent to EIP712MetaTransaciton.sol but without the constructor. And EIP712Base has _initializeEIP712(string memory name) method.
undefined says You can just call _initializeEIP712() and pass a name param, version param is a constant value in EIP712Base.sol, but you can pass it too as a parameter to _initializeEIP712 function
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy thank you buddy!!
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy i notice that NativeMetaTransaciton.sol is missing the msgSender() function- instead it's in ContextMixin.sol- which is not inherited in either NativeMetaTransaciton.sol or EIP712Base.sol. Do you know what the rationale is for this? I would like to just copy the function over to NativeMetaTransaciton.sol  (just like how it's done in the normal EIP712MetaTransaction.sol) but I think it's worth trying to understand why it's not already done this way, so I don't miss something important?
undefined says Hey @Deleted User the contracts are written by matic team, but I think rationale behind putting msgSender method in separate contract is to follow the pattern made by open Zeppelin, they created this Context.sol with msgSender and msgData methods, so if u have used these contracts before,  it's easy to add the meta transaction funtionality later by just replacing the msgSender method implementation in Context.sol...


But you can use the msgSender method in your NativeMetaTransaction.sol contract itself also..
undefined says ok makes sense, thank you 🙂
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy another question sorry 😛 do you know of any projects out there with public repos that have truffle/buidler/whatever tests for metatransactions? would be curious to see how they extract s/r/v of an account in order to pass to `executeMetaTransaction `
undefined says hey not sure about other projects..but you can check the test cases here https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/test/EIP712MetaTransaction.test.js
undefined says to see how r/s/v are extracted
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy sorry for late reply, only just saw your response. that is exactly what im after, thanks!!!
undefined says Hello!
undefined says The source code for our contracts is under the MIT license and we want to keep it that way.   But I noticed that biconomy meta transaction contract source code is using the GPL-3.0 license.
undefined says If we use biconomy's contract source code in our contracts for the meta transactions do we have to put our code under the GPL-3.0 license?  Because we don't want to do that.
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says Hey @mudgen thanks for pointing it out.. there's no problem for us to republish the contract code under MIT license so you can use them in your code base... let me republish under new MIT license
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy thanks so much!  awesome!
undefined says Updated the License to MIT 👍
undefined says 👍
undefined says Just a question, does the Biconomy SDK work with ethersjs?
undefined says @Aditya | Biconomy @Ahmed Al-Balaghi
undefined says Hey @mudgen yes, it does.
undefined says great, thanks
undefined says 👍👍
undefined says hi guys, do you prefer webpack or parcel for bundling your web3 js code? and how does your .babelrc and package.json look?because  i find myself getting lot of bundling warning and sometime errors(RegeneratorRuntime) after bundling
undefined says Hey there @hack3r-0m let me get back to you on that
undefined says Hey @hack3r-0m webpack is most used tool for bundling your javascript code, so you can use that.. however mexa sdk code is very minimal and simple with not a lots of file, so we are not using any bundling tool.. But to generate the bundle to be used using <script> tag, we used browserify
undefined says You can check sdk code here https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk
undefined says hi everyone, i'll be implementing metatransactions in the aavegotchi frontend UI soon 🔥
undefined says Hmm i've followed the docs but when I create a transaction it still gives me the same metamask UI w/ gas calculation. is this correct?
undefined says i'm using ethers. after initializing the provider i'm using it to send a tx
```
const biconomySigner = await biconomyProvider.getSigner()
const ShopContract = new ethers.Contract(vars.aavegotchiDiamond, ShopABI.abi, biconomySigner)
const tx = await ShopContract.buyPortals(currentAccount, buyAmount)
```
undefined says Can you share console logs after enabling debug flag true, in Biconomy constructor?
undefined says new Biconomy (provider, {apiKey: "api-key", debug: true})
undefined says Also how did you enable native meta tx in your contract? Did you inherit EIP712MetaTransaction.sol?
undefined says 
undefined says Yes I believe we are by @mudgen implemented the metatransaction part of the contract
undefined says We are using msg.sender()
undefined says 
undefined says I can't view the ABI that he uploaded, but afaik it should have the `buyPortals()` function
undefined says would be nice if the frontend had a button to copy the uploaded ABI
undefined says Feedback Noted.
undefined says Regarding this flow, assuming you have enabled native meta tx by inheriting EIP712MetaTransaction.sol, on dashboard you need to select executeMetaTransaction method and call the same on client side by passing "buyPortal" function signature as paramter to this function..
undefined says Check this code here on how to generate params for executeMetaTransaction method on client side...
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/mumbai-demo/example/react-ui/src/App.js
undefined says ohh I still need to enable the APIs on the dashboard
undefined says yes under Manage API section, you need to select "executeMetaTransaction" method with "native meta tx" checkbox selected..
undefined says One more suggestion, on smart contract when you inherit EIP712MetaTransaction.sol which inherit BaseEIP712.sol, you should set the value of chainid as 1 instead of using solidity method chainid()... this will allow you to do meta txn on Matic while user is still on Ethereum mainnet in his metamask wallet on client side.
undefined says Okay, so client side I need to actually call `executeMetaTransaction()`, can't just call `buyPortals` using the biconomyprovider's signer?
undefined says and need to include all this code?
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/tutorials/native-meta-transactions/integrate-biconomy/integrate-mexa-sdk this page should give a clearer explanation on how to actually send a transaction with biconomy
undefined says I'm still getting the error "API not found for method buyPortals" even though it's enabled in the dashboard
undefined says Yes we are restructuring the docs and about to release it in few days... Adding all this information as well..
undefined says 
undefined says On dashboard it looks fine, on client side, you need to call executeMetaTransaction method...
undefined says okay looks i didn't click "save" after adding
undefined says now the API is added
undefined says so in the docs where it says ```You have now enabled meta transactions in your DApp. Interact with web3 the way you have been doing it.``` this is not true?
undefined says 
undefined says the relay works now, but it's saying my account doesnt have enough GHST (erc20) even though the account has enough
undefined says Its true given the method you are calling has native meta txn enabled..  otherwise msg.sender will be of relayer address and you business logic will fail, as you are seeing above... 

here since the method you are calling directly, the msgSender () will just return msg.sender i.e., relayer address and ofcourse relayers won't have GHST balance...
undefined says right
undefined says That's why you should call executeMetaTransaction which internally will call buyPortals() method l, msgSender() method will return actual user address and TXN will go through
undefined says is there an example calling `executeMetaTransaction` in your docs or on github? all the ones i saw involve getting the user's private key
undefined says Check this 
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/mumbai-demo/example/react-ui/src/App.js
undefined says Check onSubmit() method
undefined says i see
undefined says lol you should definitely remove this from your docs "You have now enabled meta transactions in your DApp. Interact with web3 the way you have been doing it." cause this is a lot more  complicated then it sounds 🤣
undefined says do you have a version that using ethers instead of web3?
undefined says haha yes I understand.. we are about to release new documentation in few days that provide all these details
undefined says Let me see
undefined says BTW will this work with any provider, or only metamask?
undefined says we also support walletconnect, arkane, portis, etc in our dapp
undefined says Any provider...
undefined says M away from my laptop right now, give me some time (an hour or so) to find the ethers implementation..
undefined says Okay thanks, I am also slowly converting from web3 to ethers
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/kovan-demo-ethers/example/react-ui/src/App.js#L120
undefined says This the ethers implementation example code
undefined says great thanks
undefined says Apprecate the feedback @coderdan
undefined says Looking forward to the launch of the game with meta txns enabled!
undefined says yes working hard to get it done!
undefined says okay finally got the signature popping out! 

just got this error though: ""MetaMask Message Signature: Error: missing value for field chainId of type uint256"
undefined says Can you show me your domainData?
undefined says ``` let domainData = {
            name: "Aavegotchi",
            version: "1",
            verifyingContract: vars.aavegotchiDiamond
        };```
undefined says do i need to add the chainId?
undefined says Yes, check line 77
undefined says should i be using `onSubmitWithPersonalSign` or `onSubmitWithEIP712Sign`? getting an error: "execution reverted: Signer and signature do not match"
undefined says Eip712
undefined says Cross check name and version with your contract values while deploying
undefined says in domain data?
undefined says Yes this name and version should match
undefined says is domain the name of the contract (Aavegotchi) or the function name (buyPortals)?
undefined says for example, you must have inherited our contract in your contract like this

contract TestContract is EIP712MetaTransaction("TestContract","1") {
//
}
undefined says ahh
undefined says okay
undefined says Okay fixed that issue
undefined says So after signing, the metamask signing dialog goes away and another dialog pops up that looks like the normal contract interaction dialog w/ gas
undefined says No error
undefined says looks like it's trying to call `executeMetaTransaction` as a normal transaction, even though it's enabled to be perform meta transactions
undefined says What does the console logs say?
undefined says no error
undefined says not the error, but it must be printing some logs..
undefined says after i get the signature, i'm calling ``` tx = await MetaTransactionsContract.executeMetaTransaction(userAddress, functionData, r, s, v);```
undefined says How this MetaTransactionsContract object is created?
undefined says ```  const MetaTransactionsContract = new ethers.Contract(vars.aavegotchiDiamond, MetaTransactionsABI.abi, ethersSigner)```
undefined says ethersSigner is from ethers.getSigner()
undefined says the ethersSigner should be taken from the ethersProvider object initialized using biconomy object
undefined says let ethersProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(biconomy);
let signer = ethersProvider.getSigner();

use this signer object
undefined says ahh right i must be using the wrong provider
undefined says 
undefined says WOW! it worksss
undefined says Yayyy🤩🤩
undefined says awesome 🙂
undefined says curious...what's the roadmap for Biconomy?
undefined says if we're building our dApp around your API, would be nice to know that you'll be around for a while 😛
undefined says haha definitely, we are here to stay.. we recently closed our seed round of $1.5 mn.. we have our two products coming out soon that'll make the life of web3 users and developer easier.. 
one product is focused on Layer1 where end users would be able to pay gas fee in ERC20 tokens(initially DAI, USDC, USDT) so developers don't need to sponsor gasfee by themselves
second product is around solving the Exit problem from Layer2 to Layer1, so our product will provide instant funds transfer between L1 <> L2..
undefined says and our roadmap involves solving all the friction points that's hindering the mainstream adoption of blockchain today...
undefined says how is product #1 different from the current UX today? aren't end users are paying gas fees (just in ETH, not erc20s)
undefined says yup in current UX, end users have to get ETH in their wallet all the time, and seeing the ETH price rally, if they can just pay gas fee in stable coins, they can save on their ETH investment...
Also its easy to keep track of your gas expenses if its paid in stable coins...
undefined says ah got it. will that also involve using metatransactions, and end users will store funds on a biconomy dashboard?
undefined says yeah it'll involve meta transaction, and end users can keep their funds in their wallets only ( we don't take any funds custody at all).. it'd be like, they give ERC20 approval first to our contract, that forward the transaction to DApps contract, and based on gas used, it charges the user account in ERC20 token..
undefined says got it, pretty neat!
undefined says some integrations with CHI or other gas tokens would be 🔥 like 1inch does
undefined says oh yeah we already got the CHI tokens integrated.. Right now its available on Kovan, and ethereum mainnet. On dashboard you just enable a switch to use gas tokens, and at backend we check if burning tokens can save gas (i.e., gas overhead added via gasTokenForwarder contract is less than the total gas saved by burning tokens) , we burn them in the same transaction.
undefined says So we mint tokens whenever gas price go low, and burn them when gas price is atleast 3x of minting price. For developers, no need to specially handle them on client side, you just need to switch on the option on dashboard...
undefined says niceee very slick
undefined says if we did this, then the user wouldn't be able to use the app when connected to Matic network, is that right?
undefined says also is there a way to show a user the status of their transaction? cause it doesnt show up in metamask anymore
undefined says also historical transactions as well
undefined says So its all about how you have enabled native meta tx in your smart contract.. eg. in your case, the domain data needs to have chainId field.. and whatever the value is on chain, same value needs to be singed on client side....

lets say on smart contract, chainId value is 137, while taking signature using metamask, it checks the selected network in metamask and value present in chainId fields in domainData and metamask reject the signature request if there's a mismatch... 

so to answer your question, if chainId on chain is 1, so yeah user wouldn't be able to use the app when connected to Matic network. However there is a solution for that.
undefined says Solution: 
Smart Contract: In domain data on smart contracts, use "uint256 salt" field instead of "uint256 chainId", and keep the value of chainid only eg 137 on matic.
Client Changes: Use "salt" field in domainDataType and domainData object instead of chainId. and use the hardcoded value same as used on contract i.e. 137.

Now it doesn't matter on which network the user is on. And also metamask won't reject the signature request as there's no chainId field in domainData.
undefined says so mexa returns the transactionHash, and now you can use either ethers **waitForTransaction** method to wait for confirmation.... or you can use Blocknative's notify sdk to show transaction confirmation notifications.
undefined says does biconomy currently expose an API to get a user's recent transactions?
undefined says or will we need to maintain those in a web2 database
undefined says (or query them from the blockchain ofc)
undefined says Not now currently, but we can make this API if required,.. current options are you maintaining in a web2 database
undefined says that would be pretty useful
undefined says What would be the purpose of the salt?   Just to help make the domain more unique?
undefined says Yeah purpose of salt is to make signatures more unique
undefined says Otherwise same signatures can be used on different chains
undefined says I made these changes to support signing metatransactions on any network:
```
bytes32 internal constant EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(bytes("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,address verifyingContract,bytes32 salt)"));

function domainSeparator(string memory name, string memory version) internal view returns (bytes32 domainSeperator_) {
  domainSeparator_ = keccak256(abi.encode(EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, keccak256(bytes(name)), keccak256(bytes(version)), address(this), bytes32(uint256(520))));
}
```
undefined says @coderdan
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy does that look right?
undefined says I removed the chainid
undefined says How 520 value is chosen? If its random I'd say use the chainid() value so no one would be able to deploy the same contracts on other chains and use the same signatures there...
undefined says yes, I see.  I guess I"m confused because earlier you said don't use chainid()
undefined says `Smart Contract: In domain data on smart contracts, use "uint256 salt" field instead of "uint256 chainId", and keep the value of chainid only eg 137 on matic.`
undefined says What do you mean by domain data?
undefined says Oh yeah by that I mean don't use the field name as chainId but value can be of chainId...
undefined says I made these changes to support signing metatransactions on any network:
bytes32 internal constant EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256(bytes("EIP712Domain(string name,string version,address verifyingContract,bytes32 salt)"));

function domainSeparator(string memory name, string memory version) internal view returns (bytes32 domainSeperator_) {
  domainSeparator_ = keccak256(abi.encode(EIP712_DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, keccak256(bytes(name)), keccak256(bytes(version)), address(this), bytes32(uint256(chainid()))));
}
undefined says Okay, I see, makes sense
undefined says thanks!
undefined says I'll change it to that
undefined says 👍
undefined says Hi @Sachin | Biconomy is this the correct domainType to implement the `salt` from above?

```  const domainType = [
        { name: "name", type: "string" },
        { name: "version", type: "string" },
        { name: "salt", type: "uint256" },
        { name: "verifyingContract", type: "address" }
    ];```
undefined says ``` let domainData = {
        name: "AavegotchiDiamond",
        version: "V1",
        verifyingContract: vars.aavegotchiDiamond,
        salt: "80001"
    };```
undefined says Using 80001 for the salt because we're testing on Mumbai
undefined says Getting the signer and signature do not match error again
undefined says Try changing to this:
```
const domainType = [
        { name: "name", type: "string" },
        { name: "version", type: "string" },        
        { name: "verifyingContract", type: "address" }
        { name: "salt", type: "uint256" },
    ];
```
undefined says it should be this

const domainType = [
    { name: "name", type: "string" },
    { name: "version", type: "string" },
    { name: "verifyingContract", type: "address" },
    { name: "salt", type: "bytes32" }
];
undefined says let domainData = {
  name: "AavegotchiDiamond",
  version: "V1",
  verifyingContract: vars.aavegotchiDiamond,
  salt: '0x' + chainId.toString(16).padStart(64, '0')
};
undefined says Ah great, I'll try that
undefined says yes, that's right,  salt is bytes32
undefined says :)
undefined says do we need to re-add the smart contract after implementing this salt?
undefined says You shouldn't
undefined says Are you calling the same contract which is registered?
undefined says your dashboard email?
undefined says i can check if you have created the  dapp on correct network
undefined says nick@aavegotchi.com
undefined says chainId is 80001
undefined says Oh I know why
undefined says he deployed a new version of the contract to Mumbai
undefined says The new version's address is `0x9456d4d9DCfe168Ef4D0215b0Aa324AcE0b024c9` is it possible for you to change it in the backend?
undefined says The frontend console only allows us to delete
undefined says aahh, no , we are not allowed to touch the backend DB lol
undefined says you can delete the earlier one and add new one
undefined says haha okay, will do, thanks!
undefined says Hey @coderdan just FYI, you don't need to add all the methods on dashboard, just executeMetaTransaction methods is enough
undefined says coz that's the one you are calling
undefined says Understood.   He knows this now.
undefined says We want to send metatransactions  for Mumbai  when Metamask is connect to Mumbai,   or when Metamask is connected to Ethereum or other network.  But when we try this we get this error:
undefined says Is there a way around this?   @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says In this case, don't take the provider object from the wallet (metamask), instead create a new ProviderObject with mumbai network RPC url..
undefined says and pass that provider object to Biconomy object, so that network id matches with the network id for the API Key on dashboard... 
and when it comes to taking user signature, use the wallet provider object, that'll just popup signature screen...
then you have the signature, so now use the earlier provider object you passed to biconomy to call 'executeMetaTransaction' method
undefined says got it, thank you!
undefined says Hi there, is there a BiconomyForwarder address for Matic Mainnet? I don't see one here: https://docs.biconomy.io/misc/contract-addresses
undefined says Hey yes BiconomyForwarder contracts are being audited right now... once they are audited we'll update the BiconomyForwarder mainnet address there.. you can just test it on Mumbai right now
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy Oh awesome ty for quick reply 🙂 Do you have a rough estimate for that just so I know - days, week, 1month+?
undefined says rough estimate would be 2 weeks..
undefined says Is this instruction on the network agnostic page still correct? `3. Hardcode chainId as "1" in EIP712Base.sol`  https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/network-agnostic-transactions/custom-approach
undefined says Yeah so if you are following Eip712 signatures, there is a field called 'chainId' in domain data.. if you keep the chainId to layer 2 chain Id and while taking EIP712 signature metamask is on ethereum (chainid 1) then metamask throws error that chainId doesn't match with current Network
undefined says So by hardcoding the chainId as 1, you are bypassing this error in metamask while taking the signature...
undefined says I see, I'm also reading the history of the discussion here: https://discord.com/channels/692403655474937856/692404159982338059/803242939022311454 Is there an example on github somewhere of the implementation you suggest of replacing chainId with salt
undefined says There are other workaround for this also.. eg don't use the field "chainId" in domain data... Instead use other name eg "salt" and use the value of chainId only.. and use signTyped_v3 method to take eip712 signature..
undefined says @coderdan has done it this way.. @coderdan can you share the code where you have used network agnostic transactions and used "salt" in domain data while taking eip712 signatures?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy I see the the EIP712Base implementation in matic pos-portal has salt in domain rather than chainid, so this looks correct to you? https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/v1.2.0/flat/ChildERC20.sol#L1236
undefined says Oh yeah, that's the one you can refer... That looks correct to me
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy Great, thank you so much for the help 🙂 And I appreciate the responsiveness too. Integrating Biconomy today, excited about it
undefined says Awesome.. thanks. Looking forward.. 👍😀
undefined says Exciting, what Dapp are you planning on building
undefined says Hi
undefined says had a question, in my app, I have a contract per user, does this mean everytime a user shows up I have to add that contract to dashboard?
undefined says what contract are you using per user? Is it gnosis or your own?
undefined says our own
undefined says but can make it EIP 1167 compatible
undefined says why does it matter?
undefined says M saying that coz with gnosis, you don't have to upload each gnosis contract on dashboard as they are being created.. 

With your own contract, how is the flow? 
Does transaction directly interacts with user contract or it goes via single proxy and then to user contracts..?
undefined says currently goes to user contracts directly
undefined says but how can I make a single proxy for that?
undefined says it would be proxy over proxy ... 🙂
undefined says Hi @mrl3go yeah it would be a proxy over proxy, and that proxy can have a whitelist of your user contracts, so it forward calls to those proxy only...
undefined says Yeah doing that
undefined says What's the good way to implement that proxy interface?
undefined says Naive way is to just copy the functions and then pass _msgSender() as argument
undefined says To user contract
undefined says Is there a better way?
undefined says can we also whitelist via the api? listening to events on the blockchain and calling the api method to register a contract created by our factory?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says https://api.biconomy.io/api/v1/dapp/whitelist/destination
undefined says can we use this route?
undefined says is there an example of this by the way
undefined says This whitelist api right now works with gnosis contract wallet only... but yeah this concept can be used in your case, we need to enable support for your contract wallet.... we did for gnosis coz its most used contract wallet so far.... what's your user contract implementation btw?
undefined says Not exactly like this, but one of our clients created this MetaTxForwarder contract.. https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/address/0xBF6755A83C0dCDBB2933A96EA778E00b717d7004/contracts

You can extend this to include whitelisting functionality also
undefined says that's perfect, thanks @Sachin | Biconomy 🙏
undefined says how would the front-end change then? we have to manually prepare the calldata?
undefined says enocodefunctiondata?
undefined says yeah from front-end whatever function you are calling will be passed to the forward function as encodedFunctionData parameter...
undefined says Hi @Sachin | Biconomy , so I can't get my head around this. If I use a proxy like the one you said, then if I understand it correctly, I will register that proxy on dashboard. ok but now that proxy calls my actual user contract and msg.sender will be the proxy. Following EIP 2771 then _msgSender() in my user contracts will fail cause msg.sender is not a trusted forwarder. 
The next problem is even if that is solved, I'm encoding the calldata in the client side which won't have the original sender address unless I should also add that in the proxy?
undefined says Hey @mrl3go 
So first problem can be solved using delegateCall from the proxy contract, so msg.sender is the trusted forwarder address in your user contract..

Secondly, original sender address is appended in the calldata in Trusted Forwarder contract, you don't need to do that on client side...
undefined says but with delegatecall the user contract runs the logic with the proxy state, that is undesirable.

original sender address is appended in calldata of the call to the proxy but then I'm passing calldata of user contract to proxy as parameter which doesn't have the address I assume
undefined says I see your concerns..  let me think
undefined says I think we figured it out
undefined says we pass the address to the proxy
undefined says check with msgSender
undefined says in proxy
undefined says then abi.encode it and call the user contract
undefined says two levels of actually the same forwarder kind of thing lol
undefined says But in user contract, msgSender() method msg.sender would be your proxy and msgSender method logic would fail... How you solved this?
undefined says Append it to end of calldata in proxy
undefined says But in your smart contract in _msgSender() method, it checks if msg.sender is trusted forwarder and then it returns the appended user address from the call data
undefined says how will that work in your case?
undefined says I can set the trusted forwarder to my proxy it's just an address
undefined says got it, just make sure that forward method in the proxy is not used by anyone directly.. and there should not be any way to append any user address at the end of calldata.. and the call to Proxy must come from trusted forwarder...
undefined says what's signedTx here? @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says ```
let data = {
      signature: signature,
      rawTransaction: signedTx,
      signatureType: biconomy.PERSONAL_SIGN,
    };
```
undefined says from the docs
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/network-agnostic-transactions/eip-2771
undefined says signed rawTx?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy I'm trying to use the API not the SDK and with metamask, I try to call estimateGas() and gives me this error
undefined says MetaMask - RPC Error: execution reverted: Function can only be called through the trusted Forwarder
undefined says @livingrock7 can you check it?
undefined says What function are you calling in estimates gas?
undefined says i assume this is the message coming from the Proxy you have made.. if that's the case, you can put trusted forwarder address in "from" field in estimation
undefined says a function in the proxy yes
undefined says I get a signature mismatch error from the API
undefined says strange, the metamask popup shows as well
undefined says Are you using Eip712 signatures?
undefined says I used both
undefined says same error
undefined says Can you share a gist of your code if possible, client side and smart contract both?
undefined says before that, if I'm not inheriting baserelay.sol and just add the functions manually in the smart contract is that a problem?
undefined says No that is not the problem
undefined says https://github.com/creaton-io/creaton/blob/denver/contracts/src/CreatonAdmin.sol
undefined says Are you calling the methods from a client interface using a wallet or from backend using a private key??
undefined says https://github.com/creaton-io/creaton/blob/denver/web/src/pages/sign-up.svelte#L74
undefined says I'm calling it from a client interface using a wallet
undefined says Got it.. let me check
undefined says tnx
undefined says Hey @mrl3go will check this now and get back to you shortly
undefined says 👍
undefined says on goerli right
undefined says @mrl3go
undefined says are you able to correctly import this
import {BiconomyHelper} from '../biconomy-helpers/biconomyForwarderHelpers';
undefined says can you log this line in your code
undefined says https://github.com/creaton-io/creaton/blob/denver/web/src/pages/sign-up.svelte#L91
undefined says yeah I changed that
undefined says added goerli contract
undefined says can you update and use these helpers
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-helpers
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-helpers/blob/main/src/helpers/biconomyForwarderHelpers.js
undefined says Yuo can use this reference for using ethers and EIP2771 API 
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/forwarder-metatx-ethers-api/example/react-ui/src/App.js
undefined says keen to know if you find any bugs!
undefined says I suggest you have a setter for trusted forwarder in your contract so you dont have to redeploy it
undefined says is the signature in hex format?
undefined says I mean i'm following this completely
undefined says now I get a new error
undefined says Error while gas estimation with message Returned error: execution reverted: Forwarded call to destination did not succeed"
undefined says @livingrock7
undefined says but when I send the exact tx without biconomy it goes through
undefined says ok so the signature verification is happening now.. good...  for this error, it looks like when transaction is routed via BiconomyForwarder, some revert is happening..
In this case where your transaction is happening if done by biconomy, mostly the cause is either you are still using msg.sender, or you have not set correct TrustedForwarder address..
can you please verify these?
undefined says trusted forwarder on Goerli : 0x3075b4dc7085C48A14A5A39BBa68F58B19545971
undefined says we will deploy new forwarder on testnets that bubbles up actual revert error message if any
undefined says I fixed it
undefined says had to change some stuff in your code
undefined says also from should always be the original sender
undefined says not the forwarder
undefined says yes from would be userAddress
undefined says forwarding happens internally
undefined says could you show me which line
undefined says in demo or helpers
undefined says it's mostly signature in both
undefined says albeit we couldn't do abi from ethereumjs-abi
undefined says so I changed to ethers.util.soliditykeccak256
undefined says and flatten the signature
undefined says donno if the problem persists with ethereumjs
undefined says but it's always cleaner with ethers
undefined says yah ethers is way more cleaner
undefined says in helpers file?
undefined says personal sign uses this const abi = require("ethereumjs-abi");
undefined says yes
undefined says we can't use this due to node/browser conflict in our template
undefined says I see
undefined says could you open a PR in biconomy-helpers from another branch?
undefined says ye I will after the hackathon, sounds good?
undefined says sounds great
undefined says is deployCreator gasless now?
undefined says yes just the signature
undefined says no gas
undefined says great
undefined says next step is to combine this with superfluid
undefined says so pray for us lol
undefined says but the txs aren't shown on dashboard
undefined says is that normal?
undefined says ah actually they're loaded now
undefined says cool
undefined says same steps would be involved on superfluid
undefined says and we will be here to assist
undefined says 
undefined says cool
undefined says UI is a bit off now on stats 😄 we will be working on it
undefined says ui is always the BIGGEST problem

undefined says Hi, i need a small help. How to integrate biconomy in smart contract function fhat transfers erc20 token?
It gives error as not enough balance.. 

I have added apis in dashboard for both erc20 contract as well as my contract also both having eip712 added. Also normal meta txns without token transfers are working fine..
undefined says Hi @Jaspreet
undefined says can you share more details about your smart contract function and what you're trying to do
undefined says like contract function has this:       sdToken.transferFrom(_msgSender(),address(this),_amount);
undefined says So when i try to send txn via biconomy, it throws error not enough balance. Although it works fine without biconomy. Also, function works fine with biconomy if this particular transfer is removed
undefined says sdToken here is ERC20..
undefined says Can you send me the error screenshot and your client side code?
undefined says it should work if users have sd tokens balance and approval is given
undefined says Okay sure
undefined says with biconomy mexa
undefined says without biconomy, txn successful
undefined says account has balance
undefined says I see
undefined says can I get your smart contract address and abi
undefined says which network you're testing on?
undefined says Matic testnet
undefined says would like to check if trusted forwarder is set correctly
undefined says using custom one
undefined says erc20 contract address : 0xc2FBEa8F57138BF3BEb36ADbF75cDaA1833e42ce. My contract: 0x868C5A407FFbEde56cDa01F810AF2113113b8EC8
undefined says ABI for function: {

                "internalType": "uint256",
                "name": "_qid",

undefined says Yes we're getting errors.
undefined says Ok please share some details screenshots etc
undefined says will assist you with completing integration
undefined says @gmcrypto
undefined says Hey @Ether please share what you need help with here
undefined says @gmcrypto can u post the error logs
undefined says @Ahmed Al-Balaghi thanks, can we setup a private DM group, as our launch is some what private for now, aka not yet public we don't want to share too much info public yet.
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy @livingrock7 incoming DM
undefined says Yes sure
undefined says hi
undefined says Is there any recommended solution for doing a gasless transaction on an already deployed ERC20 contract? My use case is calling the "approve" method on the Matic WETH contract on behalf of the user before interacting with my marketplace contract. I have the marketplace functionality working great (L2 chain, native meta transaction) but can't figure out if I can do the ERC20 transaction w/o the user paying gas.
undefined says @shahruz  approve does not support native meta transactions without redeploying the contract. ERC20 tokens which have permit feature (DAI permit, EIP2612 type permit like USDC and uniswap LP tokens) can
undefined says If EIP3074 is passed it will solve this problem.
undefined says Currently one solution would be to write a wrapper contract on WETH contract using its address and add permit like feature.
undefined says @livingrock7 Got it, thanks for the quick response!
undefined says Hi
undefined says 0x6f69e63A123AB61f5E10a4624659F7f3801FB8B7

undefined says Hihi there
undefined says Crypto mining industry
undefined says Hi... 😉
undefined says Welcome job industry
undefined says Hello! May we have advise on how do we add funds to our "Bettery_matic" DApp, which is deployed on Matic Mainnet to sponsor our users' transactions? We're migrating our DApp from Matic Testnet (Mumbai) to Matic Mainnet. The screenshot explains our current configuration. Thank you! (maybe "support" channel suits better for this question, happy to move if so! - sorry if posted in the wrong channel)
undefined says Biggest project industry.
undefined says Need Robot to setup automatic setting
undefined says Hi sirs are you still on testnet ?
undefined says hi, our Mexa product is live on mainnet
undefined says Awesome thanks sir
undefined says I'm working on network agnostic transactions and I'm receiving this error: 

**Please pass a provider connected to a wallet that can sign messages in Biconomy options.**

My Biconomy configuration:
const provider = new providers.Web3Provider((window as any).ethereum)
const biconomy = new Biconomy(new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/"),
 {
    provider: provider,
    apiKey: '<MY API KEY>', 
    debug: true
 });  

What should I be passing as a provider instead?
undefined says Hey @fedor
undefined says Hey @redeth so rpc-mumbai is a network provider, for a wallet provider you can pass window.ethereum which will be used to sign the requests
undefined says Appreciate the response! I tried this:

const biconomy = new Biconomy(new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/%22),
 {
    provider: window.ethereum,
    apiKey: '<MY API KEY>', 
    debug: true
 });

And still have the same error. Was this the right change?
undefined says ah! This worked. Thank you!

const biconomy = new Biconomy(window.ethereum,
 {
    apiKey: '<MY API KEY>', 
    debug: true
 });
undefined says I would recommend updating the doc here: https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/network-agnostic-transactions/eip-2771 as it seems to expect an RPC connection
undefined says that's actually correct in the docs
// Pass connected wallet provider under walletProvider field
let biconomy = new Biconomy(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("YOUR RPC URL HERE"),{
    walletProvider: <Wallet Provider>, 
    apiKey: <API Key>, 
    debug: true
  });
undefined says your dapp contracts are on matic mumbai right? @redeth
undefined says as a network provider you still need that RPC
undefined says purpose of network agnostic is users dont have to change rpc connection while signing a message
undefined says internally dapp uses the network you are on and users sign through wallet provider
undefined says so it would look like below in your case

let jsonRpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/%22");
                biconomy = new Biconomy(jsonRpcProvider, {
                    walletProvider: window.ethereum,
                    apiKey: <MY_API_KEY>,
                    debug: true
                });
undefined says Thank you! Really helpful 🙂
undefined says Working through another issue... I'm using the following code to encode my transaction:

*** let contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESSES['mumbai'], testABI, biconomy.getSignerByAddress(userAddress))
 let { data } = await contract.populateTransaction.myFunction(tokenId)

 let txParams = {
    data: data,
    to: CONTRACT_ADDRESSES['mumbai'],
    from: userAddress,
    signatureType: "EIP712_SIGN"
 }

let tx = await provider.send("eth_sendTransaction", [txParams])***

The data value ends up being something like this: **'1c19c2150bfb000500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'** which looks correct to me (signature + id)

However, I'm getting an error from my contract that this tokenID does not exist. I've double checked my GraphQL layer, the block explorer, and called other functions to see whether or not this exists and it definitely does. Upon looking deeper at the error, I see that the data that Biconomy is sending in the RPC call is this:

**'0x1c19c2150bfb000500000031fd452a72b07239ee1283a4c85d32b837c000000000000000'**

It seems to me that somewhere in the ***provider.send("eth_sendTransaction", [txParams])*** call, the data is being changed. 0xbfb000500000031fd452a72b07239ee1283a4c85d32b837c000000000000000 is no longer a token that exists. I'm not sure where the ***31fd452a72b07239ee1283a4c85d32b837c*** value in the middle is coming from... Any ideas? I've logged the ***data*** variable at every step and I definitely do not insert it.
undefined says let me check 
can you share more about the contract , which method you're calling, does it have msg.sender and have you modified contracts and registered it
undefined says any contract code or your client side code gist you can dm
undefined says sure, i'll ping you directly!
undefined says QQ: do we need to extend eip 712 or can biconomy be used on existing contracts?
undefined says I see that dfyn has changed their router smartcontract code so it can use meta TRX
undefined says yes you need to make your contracts make transaction compliant
undefined says @Tejas0x
undefined says depending on the meta transaction approach you need to inherit from certain contract and redeploy
undefined says got it thanks!
undefined says hello, can someone point me to an example of a SC using biconomy and EIP2771 please? If I use EIP2771 and Biconomy's forwarded, my understanding is that I won't need to make duplicate solidity functions (ie. mint() and mintFromSig()) anymore? signature checks, hashing and execution are inhereting from biconomy's implementation?
undefined says Hey sure thing @romano, give us a moment
undefined says @Ahmed Al-Balaghi  and also, is it also possible to use the API as a way to get FIAT payment and approve the forwarder to pay in crypto? like the logic you can set up in paymaster in opegsn
undefined says also I would be interesting to study partnerships between our company and biconomy
undefined says Hello @romano here's the example for EIP2771
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_EIP712Sign.js#L126 
You wouldn't have to make duplicate functions just replace msg.sender with _msgSender() and it acts accordingly for a relayer or direct user
undefined says let me get back to you on this
undefined says @romano Happy to explore partnerships
undefined says Hi, What do you mean by FIAT payment is it for gas or something else?
undefined says like someone pays in USD offchain but has a private key. So you execute a meta tx where a relayer pay fees+transfer
undefined says So here the idea is that, the usd offchain pays for both the thing they are purchashing on chain as well as the gas fees for it?
undefined says Or is it something else?
undefined says yes this would be the main option1 but we can also imagine an option2 where the dapp maker pays for the fees himself but take the money of the payable function from the user
undefined says when you say fees what do you mean?
undefined says L1 and L2 gas
undefined says SC execution costs
undefined says Got it
undefined says (without the msg.value)
undefined says Yes, we definitely support option 2
undefined says I'm more familiar with opengsn2 but I would imagine something like a PayMaster that has a logic to handle tx on behalf of users. If a user makes an offchain top-up in USD then it would allow the user to proceed with a "payable" meta-tx that actually transfer ETH from his tank (so not only gas fees)
undefined says are we aligned on this?
undefined says Got it
undefined says It is doable, we just dont actually deal with the fiat side currently. We are partnered with Transak actually who provide fiat on and off ramps
undefined says I was more thinking of using your API and handling FIAT on my side
undefined says @romano can you share some ref contracts and working examples of any for pay master for FIAT and crypto token strategies
undefined says It could be done with Fiat on ramp off ramp services
undefined says with option 2 we dont support ether value transfer but token + token (fees) can be done
undefined says Hello, can anybody answer this question https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/issues/46
undefined says Hello I had answered yesterday few mins after issue was opened. Shall I go ahead and close?
undefined says @日你大坝
undefined says OH, thanks! I'll colse it.
undefined says is there a way to search contracts by byte code?
undefined says I want to see if a contract on matic's mainnet is also published on the testnet
undefined says don't think so but if you deploy same contract on testnet it should show other contracts deployed with same bytecode...
undefined says Network effected
undefined says No internet support coverate
undefined says Internet is gone covid19 pendemic
undefined says Discord support network .
undefined says Quick setup working
undefined says Discord
undefined says I think I deployed the same contract on the testnet already. Didn't see one with the same bytecode, is this normally shown in the explorer?
undefined says not sure depends on the explorer and chain
undefined says hi @sapien_ankit . I have some questions regarding integration
undefined says Hey hey
undefined says Tell me
undefined says @aniket | Biconomy Hey! We spoke on telegram the other day. I work @DAOventures as PM.
undefined says Ohh yehh, nice to see you here
undefined says What’s happening
undefined says Need to understand if, we can fall back to normal transaction type after we enable meta txns, in certain conditions
undefined says Yeah, totally
undefined says You can plug and play whenever you want
undefined says So say i want to enable gasless for only deposits worth x amount, and not deposits <x, is that possible?
undefined says One way to do that would be to create 2 instances of web3. One initialised with Biconomy(window.ethereum) and other directly with window.ethereum.  
And simply using a if else condition to use the desired instance.
undefined says @Keshav Thanks! il look into this.
undefined says @Keshav also if we have set the max cap on single address consuming gas, in this case if the current gas fee on eth mainnet is already high, we can again fall back to them paying? Say we want to pay $x for the user, but for his 1st tx the fee is coming out to be $2x, we can fall back?
undefined says What i mean to ask is if the current users available limit is accessible via the contract?
undefined says Ummm. Let me get back to you on that.
undefined says Yeah, we do have rate limiting modules where you have put an upper limit on the fews you want to sponsor
undefined says It won't be accessible via contract.
undefined says does anyone know what will happen with the addresses who were listed after doing transactions on the testnet
undefined says They will be eligible to have some future rewards.
undefined says I have tried morethan 2 transactions in the Hyphen, The first 2 two transactions went smooth and FAST!. hover the next 8 crosschain transactions I have tried were not soo fast and 3-4 were unable to process. Few got error message"Header not found and few transactions processed but liquidty  deposit were not auto popped up to approve. Not sure if you have put any control so that each user can only do 2 transactions. Let me know if you want me to redo will be happy to process it again.

undefined says It is worked for me later , sorry forgot to drop the message😅
undefined says Hi Guys I am not able to get the goerli and matic test tokens
undefined says i just got some test tokens from the faucet.. what error are you getting?
undefined says 
undefined says hi Guys
undefined says can you tell me why not transfer？
undefined says Looks like transfer right now have some troubles...
undefined says 30 mins ago worked pretty fine)
undefined says The liquidity is not enough

undefined says 😫 How to see if I have the conversion success, I ordered no reaction
undefined says How to see if I have the conversion success, I ordered no reaction????????????????????
undefined says hey is there some body who is having issues with approving of tokens(gaslessly) on matic testnet (mumbai)
undefined says @everyone
undefined says also how can i add my token on default token list of gasless token on matic testnet
undefined says I have tried a lot of transactions. There was a huge delay when I transferred from Goerli to Mumbai, and the display numbers seemed not to be real time. The time when I received the corresponding test coins was also very bad. There was an error when the metemask was checking the information, so I restarted the computer and tried again. Maybe it's because I clicked the command too many times. I don't understand. It's been very smooth from the time of cross chain in Mumbai.

undefined says Swapping From Mumbai to Goerli was so fast and easy no delay in confirmations however swapping from Goerli to Mumbai was not easy at all it takes time for confirmations and also you have to refresh it several times before it reflects on my wallet   0x02f88872c750e1BAb2A9985D8a3168F263779c01
undefined says Same problem. You can click more times or wait for a minute.
undefined says Good day
I think the same, the exchange from Mumbai to Goerli was quick and easy, but the exchange from Goerli to Mumbai takes a long time, and I do not see the confirmation of the transaction

undefined says is it possible to become a transaction relayer on the biconomy network yet?
undefined says Not yet @watersnake1
undefined says I see. Is there a timeline on when this will be possible?
undefined says Hopefully by end of this year
undefined says SOmething we're working on 🙂
undefined says Eagerly waiting!!
undefined says Hi everyone! Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but is it possible to relay transactions via Biconomy without having to manually register a contract in the dashboard? Our use case consists of contracts deployed through a factory so we would like to avoid manually adding each instance to the dashboard.
undefined says Hey @georgeroman
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy can help answer this
undefined says Keen to hear more on the use case!
undefined says Sure, so basically we have an ERC721 factory contract which can be used to deploy ERC721 instances. For improved UX we want users be able to interact with these instances in a gas-less manner by supporting meta transactions. Now the issue with Biconomy is that we have to manually setup a new meta transaction API for each of these instances which is not at all ideal. We would like to be able to use a single API to relay meta transactions for all of these instances. This would be very similar with how TheGraph supports contract factories by having data source templates which automatically start indexing instances created through factories (https://thegraph.com/docs/define-a-subgraph#data-source-templates-for-dynamically-created-contracts).
undefined says Got it
undefined says thanks
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy @livingrock7
undefined says Hey hey @georgeroman yeah you can use APIs to register these artifacts programmatically
undefined says Are there any docs you can point me to?
undefined says I guess it's `/api/v1/smart-contract/public-api/addContract` and `/api/v1/meta-api/public-api/addMethod`
undefined says Is there a way to get the total gas used by a single API within a DApp?
undefined says Do you mean the total gas used for meta transactions?
cc @livingrock7
undefined says Hello Biconomy team! The documentation & tutorials were relatively easy to follow and integrate in our proof-of-concept. Regarding the payment on behalf of the user, how do we set it up? The doc mentions that we pay at the end of every month. What is the process of integrating in Eth/Polygon Mainnet?
undefined says We are planning to integrate gasless meta transaction in Polygon chain.
undefined says Yes exactly
undefined says One more question, the transaction hash received from the `/api/v2/meta-tx/native` API cannot be assumed to be mined, right?
undefined says Also, is there a way to specify the gas price when using the `/api/v2/meta-tx/native` API?
undefined says hi @here is biconomy for matic testnet working fine for you guys
undefined says ```
Current provider can't send transactions and smart contract 0xe86a68cd5a994d94bb7049ace481e9a6b5fd94d6 
```
not found on Biconomy Dashbaord it is giving me this error
undefined says its giving me this error and all my contracts were working fine 15 minutes before
undefined says @Ahmed Al-Balaghi @aniket | Biconomy looking to enable eth mainnet access for my account
undefined says I participated in the double chain test, and the address is also on the winning list. However, I don't know how to get the airdrop. Do I want to know whether the airdrop has been issued? Do you need to collect it manually?
undefined says You still getting this error?
undefined says We haven't issued the rewards yet. Look out for announcement on our official group on discord, telegram and twitter
undefined says @aniket | Biconomy
undefined says Nopes i am not getting this error now
undefined says Following up again to enable ETH mainnet access for my account. Thank you.
undefined says Hey @ASTORY let me follow this up with you
undefined says Can I get your dapp website and your email ID please
undefined says I'm experiencing very long meta-transaction times (~50 minutes) on matic - I could be submitting it wrong but I don't think so as it works just fine on mumbai - is there an issue with the relayer?
undefined says Also, I think there may be a bug in the stats page - when I send a metatransaction, the transaction shows up there as having `NaN` fee, and it doesn't show up on polygonscan until it re-submits it 6 or 7 times
undefined says I just wrote a script that does this this morning actually - indeed you need to use both of those api's - the docs for addContract are misleading because it makes it seem like they take a formData object when it actually takes JSON. Also, if you don't include metaTransactionType you'll get an error saying it's undefined (even though the docs say it's optional). The other weird gotcha is addMethod gives a 200 status code in the HTTP response while the body contains a message saying it's actually a 400, so be sure to inspect the payload even when you get a 200.
undefined says More specifically, when I send the transaction via the native tx API from the front end, I get a 200 response saying the transaction was sent to mainnet within about a second, but the transaction ends up being resubmitted many many times until it actually becomes viewable on polygonscan almost an hour later.
undefined says Is this is a known issue / gotcha / is there a known workaround?
undefined says @sladuca you can wait for 50 blocks period for iconfirmation receipt and if not received you can retry from yuor end
undefined says we have received polygon network and provider related issues ref dropped transactions and we are adding more patches to handle these cases more gracefully
undefined says with provider change itself we have seen improvement with dropped transactions and being mined at first hash we give you or first resubmit attempt.
undefined says There are other scaling changes underway regarding response time and an API for you to get final transaction hash (by passing old hash) that was mined
undefined says yes NAN is for reflected for pending/dropped transactions (they might have been eventually resubmitted). above changes will reflect on dashboard stats ux as well
undefined says ok thank you
undefined says Hello Biconomy Team , I've integrated biconomy's mexa sdk into my react app using ethers js library. I'm facing this error when I'm trying to call a write transaction,

The gist is,

`const biconomy = new Biconomy(window.ethereum, { apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_BICONOMY_API_KEY, debug: true });
const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(biconomy);
const signer = provider.getSigner();

const contract = new ethers.Contract(address, ABI, signer);
const result = await contract.method(...params);`

Here is the stack trace

`TypeError: targetProvider.getSigner is not a function

Any solutions?
undefined says Hey @Techinsider99
undefined says check this example
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_EIP712Sign.js#L82
undefined says first is network provider it can be json RPC provider with network's RPC url, second is wallet provider can be window.ethereum for front end facing dapps
undefined says initialising with this pattern can be used for network agnostic transactions so if network provider doesn't have a signer or user is on different network in their wallet still signatures go through
undefined says also note this
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_EIP712Sign.js#L102
undefined says how you can get the signer
undefined says SDK handles all checks regarding signer
undefined says That worked! Thank you @livingrock7 ✨
undefined says can anybody help with getting an erc1155 ready for Biconomy?
undefined says really need some help 🙂
undefined says Hello Team,

We're integrating biconomy in our platform. But every transaction involved approvals and then a specific call to our smart contract. How should we handle it ?

Once approval is done, we can process the transaction. how this process should be handled in the client side of the application.

Thanks in advance !
undefined says Hi @jacobuterin.eth sure, your erc1155 is on which network? Can you share the source code and if its aready deployed on mainnet?
undefined says Hi @Sujith on L1 you can do gasless permits for DAI (DAI permit) and USDC / Uniswap LP tokens (tokens supporting EIP2612 permit) 
and on polygon tokens are already meta transaction compliant so gasless approval is feasible there
followed by that (confirming allowance) you can make meta tx call to your smart contract
undefined says in some cases permit and execution can be batched together
undefined says Perfect thanks
undefined says Can it happen quickly @livingrock7 ?
undefined says Like how long does it take for the relayer to process approvals ?
undefined says Yes it can quickly happen depending on network's block time and gas price
undefined says regarding gas price we start with acceptable number from gas station APIs and make sure it goes through by resubmitting them at bumped up gas price whenever need to
undefined says Ok 👌🏼
undefined says @livingrock7 my code is on polygon now and it’s pretty basic erc1155
undefined says @here i am getting error while doing gasless transaction on matic mainnet
undefined says its saying contract not found on dashboard but i have configures it on biconomy dashboard and added its api key as well
undefined says the gasless transaction were working fine on matic testnet but they are not working while i was deploying app from testnet to mainnet
undefined says Hey in developer console under Network tab, u should see an API being hit when you create Mexa, with end point
https://api.biconomy.io/api/v1/smart-contract

Can you tell me what is this API returning??
undefined says 417 error
undefined says Api not found
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says @jacobuterin.eth you can make it meta transaction compliant 
check any beidged token contract on polygon 
they all inherit from contract like this https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol or BasicMetaTransaction.sol
undefined says @sam-developer 417?
undefined says yes
undefined says Now i am getting smart contract not found on dashboard @livingrock7 @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says @livingrock7  thank you. Do I need to add all those methods or just inherit EIP712MetaTransaction.
undefined says for the contract just inherit
register contract as custom on biconomy dashboard and register method executeMetaTransaction
undefined says @sam-developer is this resolved?
undefined says yes
undefined says @livingrock7
undefined says Hello Team, we are working on an app on matic testnet, it has approvals followed by smart contract interactions, how to handle token approvals (DAI + other tokens on matic) gaslessly, and how to configure it from client side?
undefined says hey
undefined says great quesion, thanks for asking
undefined says @livingrock7 and @reppp can help answer your questions
undefined says Each mapped token on matic have "executeMetaTransaction" method in it.

So , instead of calling any method (including approve) you need to call "executeMetaTransaction" and pass the desired method functionSignature as a param in it.

You can refer this
https://gist.github.com/divyaN73/c36154904479fcab30bea3b8de39c19e

Line 85 - 103 ( Biconomy intialization & contract intialization)
Line 122-129 ( create input params)
Line 220 Call "executeMetaTransaction" with input params create above
undefined says Thanks @Divya | Biconomy , I tried this out but I'm getting an error that 'executeMetaTransaction' is not a method, are any changes required to be made at the contract level? This is the token that I'm trying to approve: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x001b3b4d0f3714ca98ba10f6042daebf0b1b7b6f. I'm using ethers js by the way
undefined says Is this contract deployed by you manually ? or mapped by polygon team from ethereum to Matic
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy  this is an AAVE testnet DAI token, https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/matic-polygon-market
undefined says hello pls can i use biconomy to build a eth<>bsc bridge for a custom ERC20 token?
undefined says @aniket | Biconomy please disable `@here` in the server settings for non-admin
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy I think this contract is not mapped one so it doesn’t support the native gaseless transactions. Only contracts mapped and deployed by matic support this right ?
undefined says yes
undefined says https://polygonscan.com/address/0x490e379c9cff64944be82b849f8fd5972c7999a7#code
undefined says check here in the implementation code of DAI
undefined says 
undefined says from your script, use address of the DAI contract and abi of the implementation contract
undefined says to call the required method
undefined says it will work
undefined says Hi! I'm trying to read the code of someone trying to implement Biconomy, and it looks very different than the docs or the code in https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/blob/master/contracts/5/BasicMetaTransaction.sol
undefined says should I be looking somewhere else?
undefined says Another way to ask this would be: if a project wants to use Biconomy for meta txs, is it possible to implement a relayed with fewer functions than those implemented in the contract linked above?
undefined says Checkout EIP2771 section on the docs, to add gasless txn via Biconomy
It’s less code and easy to implement
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/eip-2771
undefined says I'm looking through someone else's code for them, and they went with the other implementation
undefined says I have added a smart contract and I am not able the choose the added contract from the drop down while adding new APIs under manage New APIs
undefined says Can you check the abi & share the screenshot of the error?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says @Aditya | Biconomy  I can't see any error in the UI.. while I am choosing the contracts from the drop down list I am not able to select the one which I have added .. Attaching the web console error
undefined says likely the erro with contract's abi
just copy everything including [] thats it
undefined says *error
undefined says @D(inesh)
undefined says Thanks @livingrock7
undefined says Hi , I am getting the below while doing transaction any idea on how to debug?
Code: 417

undefined says Error is regarding signature signer mismatch.... please check the domain data you are creating while getting user signature
undefined says usually its the chainId, name & version values mismatch..
undefined says what approach are you using to enable meta txn on contract level? Custom or EIP2771?
undefined says Custom approach @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says Hi @Sachin | Biconomy  I can see the domain data passing correctly
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy  Can you assist me on how to debug further.. verified the domain data order on the contract,  formed data a similar data structure   in my code and passing the data structure as per the domain data structure.. Still getting signature signer mismatch
undefined says I transferred a sum of funds from matic to eth, but the operation failed halfway and the wallet was also lost. Can anyone help me?

undefined says That's a joke 😦
undefined says Let us check this for you @Divya | Biconomy @Aditya | Biconomy
undefined says 
undefined says yesterday, gasPrice on ethereum went high,
undefined says Shit that's really unlucky 🙁
undefined says https://hyphen-info.biconomy.io/
undefined says check here, from our side, the request was processed in 4 min
undefined says we can't send exit transactions with low gasPrice, as it will block exits for others
undefined says 😦 so what are your plans in this regard? hope get some compensation as an early unlucky adopter
undefined says We will see but since you did your transactions thats fine - the gas part unfrotunately we cannot control. It is up to the user always to check how much gas they're paying and if they are comfortable with that or not
undefined says In this case, I will give you advice to make a noticeable disclaimer on gas fees if they are high at the point of time
undefined says yes we are thinking about this now to include, thank you
undefined says @Ahmed Al-BalaghiWhat is the number of people participating now

undefined says 
undefined says We've already gone over 1000
undefined says Am I in the 1000's sir?
undefined says @Ahmed Al-BalaghiAm I in the 1000's sir?
undefined says Is it calculated by the number of transactions, or by the people who have completed all the tasks? I think the number of people retweeting on Twitter is less than 700
undefined says We haven't gone over 1000
undefined says Polygon and Etherum is still less than 1000
undefined says This has been updated

undefined says may be it's display error. you just need to check your address on polygonscan
undefined says `ProviderError: failed to execute call with revert code InsufficientGasFunds` any insights on Arbitrum Rinkeby? Is biconomy supposed to sponsor those tx's with test arb or do I have to top it off somewhere?
undefined says Hey! We should be sponsoring
undefined says @livingrock7 can help you here
undefined says Hey @jp4g can you share the contract address youre sending sponsored transactions for
undefined says Arbitrum v5 testnet is live and relayers are funded but I will check
undefined says I had used this bridge from poly to eth 3 times before. Did another transfer about 20 mins ago transfering usdc. The deposit was successful
undefined says but the tranfer is unclickable
undefined says and I have not recieived the usdc
undefined says https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xe0d2cb956d6daedc9462bdf50963f6f89c7ac490f91d1faea26bbbff906995f2

undefined says 0x27441e85110e676d2f09754af519efcb47e9c132
undefined says @livingrock7 should I only init the provider once or refresh it after each call?
undefined says onle once when your dapp is initialised
undefined says @jp4g
undefined says are you still getting code insufficient funds? can you share error log and complete response
undefined says log
undefined says Hi, what RPC Biconomy is using for Arbitrum's testnet?

I am running this from a node.js file and can't figure out any other logs than this being emitted
undefined says Obv api key is exposed there I will regenerate key later this is a testnet deployment anyways
undefined says Can you please dm me with error code and logs for the ones that fails. Is it 500 code 417 or something else
undefined says friended
undefined says Hi! I'm trying to get the test-hyphen instance working so I can get it integrated with a script I'm building, but the UI is getting stuck on "checking" since yesterday:
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says Can you check the console logs please and share the logs there
undefined says Also please check the Network tab for some API calls after you enter the amount
undefined says We're trying to use Biconomy to eliminate user gas fees on matic network, transferring an ERC20 token to us in return for minting an ERC721 token ( Like chicken derby and zed run drops).

We're able to do this with gas but struggling to get it to work with the EIP 2771 forwarder, is there anybody that can run through a couple of Q's?
undefined says Hey
undefined says Sure thing
undefined says I’ve dropped you a dm, thanks!
undefined says Hey how do I fund xDai?
undefined says Or matic for that matter?
undefined says I can't find any concept of a 'gas tank' I can fill
undefined says like if I want to run N transactions assuming I have sufficient gas for N transactions I can relay as many as I want consecutively?
undefined says Hey , right now we actually pay for the gas fees
undefined says Very soon we will have a gas tank concept
undefined says Since gas is low on xdai and matic, we are paying for them now
undefined says Hi! Has anyone gotten biconomy to work with 0x on polygon?  I've heard mixed opinions on if it is possible.
undefined says Works well on mumbai running mainnet rq on my project and will lyk
undefined says Also I am getting "ProviderError: FeeTooLowToCompete" on the xDai chain? It works on normal transactions (no relay / use of msgSender()). I have only changed the network, I doubt it is rpc related but I legit can't find this error anywhere on the internet
undefined says Thx! Would love to confirm 0x/Biconomy on Polygon mainnet :)).  (I'm working on it separately but you probably will beat me to it!)
undefined says Hi I've a question, so if I integrate Biconomy to the smart contract, can I use it via etherscan or only using Biconomy SDK ?
undefined says the client should integrate biconomy SDK to interact with biconomy integrated smart contracts ?
undefined says Hi @Sujith 
You would need to make your smart contract meta transaction compliant to use with Biconomy.
But you can use it via etherscan and this doesnt relate with SDK. Biconomy doesnt have control or any interference over your contract
undefined says yes, once your contracts are ready you can use Biconomy SDK or API approach
undefined says Thanks for the brief @livingrock7
undefined says My tests function on polygon as expected and mumbai works well as a dry run for polygon
undefined says this was a poorly phrased error caused by null objects
undefined says Thank you!!

undefined says Hey npm i @types/biconomy__mexa is not doing me favors for ts
undefined says is it not compatible with typescript
undefined says @Aditya | Biconomy Hi) Help him pls 👆
undefined says Apologies but mexa-sdk is not yet compatible with typescript..
undefined says @jp4g Hi) 👆
undefined says Will there be a testnet in the project?
undefined says I am also interested in this question
undefined says It was interesting. I liked it!👍
undefined says Hello everyone, does anyone know what lansBIT is?
undefined says Hi.
undefined says Also the question interests.
undefined says Will there be a testnet?
undefined says Hi,
I have inherited "BasicMetaTransaction" smart contract in my solidity code to enable meta-transaction. And I'm using `Contract.methods.myFunc(param1, param2).encodeABI()` function to get the function signature, following getSignatureParameters function to get r, s, v values:
`const getSignatureParameters = (signature: string) => {
    if (!web3.utils.isHexStrict(signature)) {
      throw new Error(
        'Given value "'.concat(signature, '" is not a valid hex string.')
      )
    }
    const r = signature.slice(0, 66)
    const s = '0x'.concat(signature.slice(66, 130))
    const _v = '0x'.concat(signature.slice(130, 132))
    let v = web3.utils.hexToNumber(_v)
    if (![27, 28].includes(v)) v += 27
    return {
      r,
      s,
      v,
    }
  }`
But the api is showing 417 error stating 'Invalid Signature' error. Could somebody help me with it please?
undefined says August 25th announcement
undefined says hey np I used `desc.d.ts` + `declare module '@biconomy/mexa'` it isn't going perfectly but it is going
undefined says I think? If you mean using polygon-mumbai or rinkeby for anything like that it for sure works super well. They sponsor the cost of all gas rn (subject to change idk when)
undefined says ^
undefined says need to see the way u generate the signature to answer that
undefined says what are the main competitors to Biconomy in defi?
undefined says OpenGSN
undefined says I'd recommend you to use EIP2771 approach of enabling meta transaction in your contract. That way you don't have to deal with these signatures and mexa-sdk will take care of these
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/eip-2771
undefined says I am trying to perform a Goerli to Mumbai hyphen transfer to simulate  ETH to Polygon but I get a "token pair not supported" code
undefined says Also what is the token address parameter?
undefined says So is ETH cross chain transfer not supported?
undefined says It is supported, problem resolved on my end.
undefined says yeah supported
undefined says Is it possible to use hyphen to tranfer ETH to MATIC instead of ETH to WETH?
undefined says Swap functionality is not there right now.. you can move Eth to weth and use dfyn exchange there to convert weth to matic in a gasless way (gasless txn integrated there)
undefined says Do you have a plan for adding arbi or avalanche on the futures ?
undefined says hello
undefined says Halo
undefined says Hi
undefined says I have another question for your team, If you could assist I would be very grateful. Our Contracts are structured like so :

SocialTokenFactory.sol -> Social.Token.sol

We only deploy SocialTokenFactory.sol, but we are inherting EIP2771 in the SocialToken.sol. These SocialToken.sol contracts are created dynamically by a calling a function on SocialTokenFactory.sol, so there is no way to know what their addresses will be ahead of time. 

How should I register the contracts in your dashboard so that all the SocialToken.sol that are created from SocialTokenFactory.sol are also known by Biconomy?
undefined says Or will we have to manually add each new SocialToken.sol (which is inheriting EIP2771) upon each new creation? If so, is there a way we could intergrate with you to write some kind of script that would update your system dynamically? Many thanks!
undefined says Over the next few weeks its possibe that we have hundreds of new SocialTokens being minted, all with new addressed all inheriting EIP2771, it would be a great deal of manual work for us if t we have to manually add each one to your database via the dashboard UI.
undefined says Also there seems to be a bug in the Dashboard, I've added my Smart Contracts in my Dapp twice now but it doesn't save
undefined says 
undefined says but nothing shows in dashboard
undefined says hi gyes
undefined says Hi, first time using Biconomy. Having some trouble while testing this out. 
Registered a dapp in Matic mumbai and trying to add smart contract but it's not getting listed. After inspecting it's showing 403 error. CORS Missing Allow Origin.
undefined says I cannot find the dappId on my dashboard, this is a required value for options object in the SDK (Mexa)
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy  Can you take look at this?
undefined says Checking
undefined says Where are you checking this description?
undefined says Check the docs.biconomy.io for updated docs
undefined says You do not need to pass dappId in the mexa sdk constructor , just the API KEY is enough
undefined says @Yash can you check this ??
undefined says Found out the issue. It was on contract side. I did not add  EIP-2771 support the contract. Once that's done, I am successfully able to add.
Error handling was confusing 🙂

But now I am have same error as @movses 
Added contracts are not listing in the dashboard.
undefined says @movses https://docs.biconomy.io/sdk/biconomy-sdk-mexa
Please check these
undefined says Can you share the link to this? We will correct it
undefined says Checking
undefined says @Athul Can you check now by adding a new smart contract? If it says SmartContract already exists remove the dapp if possible and add again
undefined says It's working now. Thanks
undefined says noted thanks
undefined says Adding API is leading an empty page.
undefined says Having same issue as before. Unable to see newly added contracts.
undefined says Me too, added contracts are not being displayed
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy Can you please take look at this
undefined says sure
undefined says hi
undefined says It's working now.. @David03g
undefined says Resolved.
undefined says I had this issue also
undefined says Are you still having the issue? I just tried now. It was working
undefined says I deleted and started again with a new contract, it worked after thath
undefined says Whats the best role for a  aspiring validator ?
undefined says 哈哈
undefined says 啊哈
undefined says @Athul It is still not working for me, and there is no option to delete dapp as richard suggested
undefined says I think delete options are only available for testnet.
undefined says though I have registered my dapp on the biconomy dashboard
undefined says Why didn't I receive usdt from the usdt cross chain of eth chain to the matic chain? The hash display succeeded
0x4721d150f6741d7c078c4aecc4b5413f887337f530ba8dc24deba33c35ff210d
undefined says This project can solve many problems, can't it?
undefined says yep)
undefined says hi
undefined says hi
undefined says This was completed.
undefined says Yes delete option is only for testnet dapps.
undefined says I am using following code to initialize hypen to convert ether to wrapped ether.

    const walletProvider = new HDWalletProvider(
      privateKey,
      configuration.web3.ethereum.http,
    );

    const hyphen = new Hyphen(walletProvider, {
      walletProvider: walletProvider, // Pass this to enable network agnostic transfers
      biconomy: {
        enable: true,
        debug: true,
        apiKey: configuration.biconamy.ethereum.apiKey,
      },
      environment: configuration.web3.environment, // It can be "test" or "prod"
    });

      const tokenAddress = configuration.contracts.ethereum.weth;
      const depositContractAddress =
        configuration.biconamy.ethereum.liquidityPoolManager;
      const fromChainId = '5';
      const toChainId = '80001';
      const userAddress = publicKey;

which works
undefined says But when using the similar code and changing ethereum to polygon and from chain and to chain id to vice versa 

Trying to unwrap the ether 

I am getting this error when executing approveERC20

'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'EIP712Domain')'
undefined says I am not sure how to do this
undefined says I am writing this code in nodejs backend. nestjs framework.
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says I see you are using HDWalletProvider and meta txns won't work with that.. try removing the biconomy option from the Hyphen constructor
undefined says 👍
undefined says 🐘
undefined says hi Biconomy dev team, I am trying to enable meta-txs and got to point where my dApp is requesting for the user's signature. After clicking it, i run into this error 417 : Error while gas estimation with message cannot est…UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT. Any suggestions on where i can start checking? thanks!
undefined says Please check if your contract support meta-transactions i.e contract should not have msg.sender.

If above is fine, try calling your contract directly without biconomy.
undefined says All announcements you can find here #deleted-channel just keep your eye on it
undefined says Where can I get Biconomy pricing details ? I am using 'gaslsess'. I want to use Developer Tier since I am expecting more than 5000 transactions per month. Where can I pay for this?

undefined says is it possible to become a validator in the network?
undefined says Hey @stake-machine hes we will be allowing anyone to become a validator
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy I saw your  demo on ethglobal youtube channel.Great stuff! I am noob to this stuff.Just wanted to asked one question.

In the demo,When you minted tokens trx happened via execute meta transaction method to ethereum test network how and from where it paid the gas fees on ethereum network?who will pay the gas fees behalf of users?

video :

https://youtu.be/xt74WZG7tsI
undefined says Biconomy relayers paid the gas fee.. At the time of the txn but we'll eventually recover this fee from the DAPP owner.. So it's the DAPP who's sponsoring the fee on behalf of the end user
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy thanks sachin
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy But how it is useful for small developers who want to make some dapps but couldn't afford to pay behalf of users?
undefined says small developers like me
undefined says would GSN contracts from openzeppelin 2.5.1 (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/v2.5.1/contracts/GSN) work for meta transactions?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy :point_up: :eyes:
undefined says anyone who writes here not on a technical issue will be banned.
undefined says hey @Aditya | Biconomy How can I be a validator on the network ?
undefined says We have a free tier where we sponsor some txns on the networks like polygon, xdai where fee is cheap...
But on ethereum we can't sponsor the txns for free due to high fee.
undefined says Yes gsn contracts are compatible but I'd recommend use open zeppelin ERC2771Context.sol for implementing EIP2771 in your smart contract...
undefined says Thank you, do i have to extend `ERC2771Context` or `MinimalForwarder` in my contract?
undefined says ERC2771Context
undefined says and if you get an compilation error because in your heirarchy tree you are inheriting from both 
Context.sol and ERC2771Context

Then just override_msgSender() and_msgData() methods and call the implementation of ERC2771Context
undefined says Got it
undefined says `metatx` folder is not available in openzeppelin 2.5.1 but I'll try to modify the solidity version and see if it compiles
undefined says i am using gnosis contracts which explicitly use solidity 0.5.0, i had been trying other meta transactions contracts but all are in 0.8.0
undefined says This might work, thank you
undefined says Cool 👍
undefined says Can you explain in a simple way to me the solution to help reduce the gas cost of binconomy?
undefined says And I see Biconomy is supporting a lot of ETH network. So, Is Biconomy considered a layer 2 solution?
undefined says Hello! For some reason my invitation link doesn't work, users can not join the group. How can I solve it?
undefined says anyone who writes here not on a technical issue will be banned.
undefined says is there a place I can test out biconomy?
undefined says Would like to get a feel of the UX
undefined says You can try dfyn exchange.. Or zed run
undefined says If Biconomy operate a gasless transaction, how will it profit?
undefined says So dyfn is what enables gasless payments - am I right?
undefined says @RalDy - yes interesting point - how would the protocol generate fees then?
undefined says I want to write a Twitter thread and needs information so as to answer basic information
undefined says dfyn is a DEX on polygon that uses Biconomy to Enable gasless transactions..
undefined says Is it possible that make a NFT with biconomy chian?
undefined says Like other NFT minting on Solana
undefined says Like Solarmy project
undefined says Stop say hello or hi
undefined says No biconomy is not a general purpose Blockchain, it simplifies transactions happening on existing Blockchains
undefined says Anyone who writes here not on a technical issue will be banned. 📌
undefined says When I register it just gets me to the coin list page it does not confirm I’m actually registered to buy the token
undefined says Hi, I have a website kind of ecommerce, where a user will have to pay in matic, and when we verify that the payment is successful, then next page will be opened, else not.
So can the verification be done using biconomy?
undefined says Hi there, transaction executed 8 hours thru the https://hyphen.biconomy.io/ still not appeared on polygon - who can help?
undefined says wtf ? spam? @Prestx00 | Biconomy  mod please check
undefined says ban him
undefined says what do u mean by spam
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy

What was the seed round price with coinbase and what was the price with genblock capital?
undefined says Could anyone send me the whitepaper for Biconomy? The website link for the whitepaper seems to be broken.

undefined says Facing the same problem as well, been a week now
undefined says @Abhisek @SKnai can you share the screenshot where you add contract ABI and contract address
undefined says I was able to add the contracts and abi, would the issue be with trusted forwarder meta transactions?
undefined says This might happen if you are adding an empty array in abi, make sure all the values are correct
Also share the error in the chrome console, that will be helpful
undefined says Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    at AddCustomDetails.componentWillMount
undefined says thats the error I'm getting

undefined says

undefined says I just checked it just in case, everything works correctly, if the poisoning is not less than the recommended amount.
undefined says i sent 0.25
undefined says #deleted-channel then you'd better write to this thread.
undefined says Hyphen is scam
undefined says I lost $4000 worth of eth
undefined says @Dimmao be aware of phising
undefined says I've lost all my money today
undefined says The support will empty your wallet.
undefined says They'll send you link to rectify wallet bullshit
undefined says And will access your account and wipe it clean.
undefined says Be careful and be vigilant. Fraudsters who write personal messages have become very active. The project team does not do such things and does not write personal messages.💯 📌
undefined says My transaction was pushed through and it came. access to the wallet was not requested. You seem to run into scammers
undefined says You said a different number yesterday
undefined says Nice
undefined says I am sorry all. Hyphen delayed my transaction for 24+ hours I contacted on the support page.
undefined says Then I was scammed.
undefined says Long story. That delayed transaction came thru and that's all the money I have now 😩

undefined says Help
undefined says #deleted-channel Write about your problem there.
undefined says Hey guys, I want to integrate the erc20 payment plugins, is there any docs I can follow
undefined says there is information on allocations for swaps?
undefined says soon #deleted-channel
undefined says I swapped tokens, how can I check my wallet in the whitelist?
undefined says There are several wallets that were used by Hyphen prior to November 1st.  No publicly available list
undefined says one question: does your api solve interoperability between native blockchain sdk ? example eth I have to use solidity, for solana I have to use something else and so on
undefined says one question: How to become a blockchain developer ?
undefined says It doesn't solve this problem.. we come into picture when you have made your dapp on a particular blockchain and now you want to make it really simple for your end users to interact with your dapp by abstracting away all blockchain complexities
undefined says Go through the basics of blockchain (start with bitcoin and etheruem whitepaper)... make your basics strong first then move on to how to create a dapp, how to write smart contracts(start with ethereum test networks) and how to interact with them using a simple front-end..
undefined says thank you 😆
undefined says Hello, everyone, Hope you are doing well.
I would ask one thing related in Biconomy sdk, so currently working to integrate biconomy for my meta transaction in react/typescript version
Does any one know how to make comfortable with typescript version?
Thank you in advance
undefined says May i know biconomy contract address?
undefined says Not yet
undefined says Hello everyone 
I would like to implement native meta transactions for my dapp which will be deployed on polygon. Please help me answer these questions.

1. How would integrating Biconomy's API  affect the transactions speed? 
2. Are there any limits? i.e  the number of requests. My dapp users will be sending a lot of transactions at the same time

TIA.
undefined says can I use biconomy on SOL or DOT
undefined says hey guys i don't really understand how to use biconomy? I want to buy some crypto in the eth chain block but the gas fees are very high, how can i buy for less gas? sorry for bad english

If i integrate the EIP2771 in my NFT ERC721/ERC1155 smart contract, for Polygon and ethereum, i need to play additional to biconomy for use the meta transation?? or only with integrate your solution based on EIP2771, y can reduce the gas fee cost from my users???
becuase in the documentation is not clear about??
and in the case i want to use the Solution of ERC20 Forward, and permit to my user pay gas with a ERC20 in Polygon or BEP20 in Binance, is possible with your plataform???
pls help me with that pls!!!
undefined says .
undefined says biconomy code B500 error?
undefined says what does that mean
undefined says how much biconomy token i need to hold  execute/implement native meta transaction using my dapp
undefined says l
undefined says Holding $BICO is not the prerequisite for using galsess product rigt now. This could change in the future though
Read the documentation on how to set up meta transactions here - https://docs.biconomy.io/
undefined says hi
undefined says When will the private placement round be issued
undefined says hi
undefined says Hey what’s your exact question ?
undefined says No need for bico
undefined says I can use biconomy on polygon and binance through standard rip 2772, additional for offer gas less transaction in my NFT Smart contract i need a gas tank, i understood not need s gas tank only implement the eip 2771 into my contract config this in your dapp dashboard and execute the transaction s very low cost??? Is this way or not???
undefined says I know I am going to sound like a complete noob but I kind of study the class on LinkedIn and came across all of this is there anyone who is willing to just give me 10 minutes to explain and kind of catch me up. I think I have everything set up but I don't know
undefined says hi
undefined says Yes, so you use the gas tank where you deposit gas and when your end users use your dapp, gas fees will be taken away from the gas tank - do you have any specific questions about the dashboard?
undefined says Yes I several times try to create a new dapp and i can't i don't know why??
undefined says Inclusive i can't verify my address

undefined says I'm getting this message
undefined says Yes, ethereum deposits are not gasless
undefined says You need to pas gasfee
undefined says Looks like you dont have enough funds
undefined says The whole purpose for to use the bridge from eth to polygon was to do it gaslees and pay it with usdc instead of eth. Isn't it ?
undefined says Is there any other method to do this ?
undefined says That is polygon to ethereum you are talking about.

From polygon, deposit is sponsored by Biconomy and on ethereum side exit is deducted from the transferred amount
undefined says From ethereum to polygon, deposit we can't sponsor as gasfee is high

undefined says Hey @Sachin | Biconomy or @Divya | Biconomy will look into this as soon as possible
undefined says I'm trying to add a Smart contract. Is there something wrong with my abi? I decompiled it from polyscan. https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x4865Fd3212eE392DB0E9e649E21E3A094891Cac7#code
undefined says Still cant aprove contract in avax
undefined says Why you stil you repair this?(
undefined says @Yash
undefined says Hey - we are looking into it
undefined says Hey is this for gasless?
undefined says Can you please expand on this particular query?
undefined says sir, Binance Chain is not supported on hyphen yet.
undefined says Please keep the gasless mode off, Gasless is not supported on Avalanche
undefined says yea
undefined says Got it
undefined says @Yash can help you here - please do give us till Monday to respond if thats ok
undefined says Happy new year folks
undefined says Happy New Year to all. Looking for some insight on setting up a node?
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hey just confirming, you have copied the Contract ABI from this page: 
https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x4865Fd3212eE392DB0E9e649E21E3A094891Cac7#code

I got this:
undefined says It's working now thanks. Is there a delay before contracts show up on Polygonscan? The ABI wasn't there when I initially checked. It was just bytecode.
undefined says I'm trying to set up a gasless mint. I need a relayer url. Which api method should I use?
undefined says Not sure about this delay, but great that its working ✌🏻
undefined says Relayer url as in, didn't understand? Can you share more details
undefined says I'm using Thirdweb. They support meta transactions. I need to add a relayer url so I can give users gasless mints.
undefined says hi I just used Zed Run's (Biconomy: Hyphen Bridge) and I still have yet to receive my polygon WETH and its been 1 and a half hours
undefined says Hey
undefined says Can you post this message along with your txn hash on the hyphen support channel
undefined says We will have it processed right away. Sorry it’s taking this long. It’s not typically the case
undefined says Send me a dm
undefined says Let me know if he  @Deleted User wants to cheat you
Remember that no one on the team will ask for your wallet keys
undefined says Okay, let me discuss with the team, I'll get back to you
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hi Biconomy Team

I'm now trying to perform a function contains `transferFrom` tx on Polygon and would like to call it on Eth using biconomy
I covered everything but to perform `transferFrom` tx, we should approve the amount first
The main issue I'm facing is there's no way to do `approve` tx using biconomy coz most of the erc20 tokens on Polygon not supporting.
Furthermore, to call `approve` method using biconomy I should register all tokens to my account

Is there any smart solution to resolve it?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says @livingrock7 @Lovejeet | Biconomy ^
undefined says Hi @ceogsty
undefined says most of the tokens on polygon support gasless approvals as they inherit from EIP712MetaTransaction.
undefined says you can make use of method executeMetaTransaction
undefined says for registering smart contracts you can do it programmatically
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/api/dashboard-apis
undefined says https://twitter.com/HarpalJadeja11/status/1481131337025486852?t=LuECV5gGE7DVMG_26GjLeA&s=19
undefined says Is Biconomy willing to fund this 👆😅
undefined says Hi guys, started Web3 Development recently and currently head first into smartcontracts. Looking to understand one concept on Mexa - Gasless Transactions.

Can gasless be used to facilitate sending MATIC across a smartcontract? So sending MATIC to the contract and then minting from the contract, all while the relay actually pays the gas on these?
undefined says this would be a great grant idea
undefined says Hey, welcome to web3
undefined says Whats the exact use case you're trying to do?
undefined says Because meta transactions wont work on the native token of the chain - so it wont work for the matic token specifically, but all other tokens and smart contracts that dont rely on msg.sender can all implement meta transactions
undefined says Well the idea was to implement it on Polygon and MATIC directly.
undefined says Which makes it a bit more user friendly to onboard and use with me covering the first onboarding expenses.
undefined says got it, thing is, the ux is as is if youre using matic and paying with matic
undefined says Hello guys. I started looking into the Biconomy api and sdk (really nice btw) to build a smart contract deployer script. The idea is to send all the deployment transactions through the Biconomy relayer. I noticed you need to create a dapp and add at least 1 smart contract to it, so you can use the relayer. Is it possible to just route the transactions without interacting with any smart contract? Thanks
undefined says Hi folks! Im in Ethereums hackathon right now, and I need some quick help.  How can I import this contract to my solidity file? (truffle) https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/master/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol
undefined says This is the only npm package biconomy has, and does not have the contract
undefined says https://www.npmjs.com/package/@biconomy/mexa
undefined says @agrozold | Biconomy banhammer can u help?
undefined says Whoa buddy, I think you need to wait for someone on the team
undefined says im ape in these cases))
undefined says Oh ok ok, thanks for the reply. Should I contact someone directly?
undefined says @livingrock7 @Yash can help you
undefined says thanks, I manage to bring them in 🙂 now facing this
undefined says Hey what’s your specific use case?
undefined says ya i am looking for a grant for this idea 😅
undefined says Sure - we’re actually devising a grant program @Rohan Garg | Biconomy @aniket | Biconomy
undefined says hey folks, has anyone faced this before: not being able to select their smart contract to enable metatx for their method?
undefined says CLICKING ON THE NEW API button
undefined says and i go to a blank page
undefined says 
undefined says is this a bug or something?
undefined says @cRekto @Anatoli401 | Biconomy can u please check this? looks like a bug
undefined says Hey @GandalfTG ,Thanks for reporting this 😀. Our developers are working on this issue, till then please make sure that the added ABI is in valid format 👍. Kindly let us know if you still face the difficulties in manage apis.
undefined says yeah Chirag helped me out
undefined says if u have any guidance in this
undefined says @Nikhita
undefined says @livingrock7 can help 😀
undefined says Awesome. @livingrock7 if u can show any help around how to implement the trustedForwarder into a smart contract that will help a lot
undefined says is it not supported for Mumbai testnet?
undefined says only the Support Specialist with an orange nickname can help you with your issue.
undefined says Hey @Ahmed Al-Balaghi ! The idea is to create a deployment script that will deploy all the smart contracts of the project using the Biconomy API (the relayer part can help us to control who is sending the txs, set rate limits, control the costs, etc). But as far as I could understand we can't simply use the API to send transactions if we don't define a contract in the dapp. Is that right? Thanks
undefined says Definitely let me know about it
undefined says Got it - yes - this is a great use case you are going after - @livingrock7 could maybe suggest an alternative way
undefined says quick one from me
undefined says anyway I can track revenue generated from the protocol?
undefined says We will have this open up as the protocol gets live
undefined says great question

undefined says Hello, I am making a decision to use the OpenGSN setup and Biconomy. One of the concerns is whether the biconomy relayers are decentralised.  Tried to google for the differences but couldn't find any meaningful comparisons online. Is there any people who can help on this?
undefined says Ah i read a description of this in the FAQ
undefined says At the moment we are not decentralised, we are optimising for features and ensuring a great developer experience
undefined says Our litepaper describes the route to decentralisation
undefined says I have a question sir ,
Can i use biconomy technology for CeX withdrawals of ETH by polygon network to escape the high fees without the customer knowing it ?
undefined says @Sun☀ can you explain the use case in brief, might be able to help here
undefined says Hey guys we have been getting an internal server error while interacting with one of our nft contracts using biconomy 
We have implemented eip 2771 for the transactions and changed msg.sender to _msgSender()
But we have been still getting same error 
Can someone help me out here?

The error happens
undefined says When the user is whitelisted for the mint but if user is not whitelisted it would perfectly interact with contract  and 
Show error "user not whitelisted"
undefined says Hey sure thing - some of the team are off today due to national holiday, so we should get back to you shortly
undefined says Hey thanks brother hope i can get back to you
undefined says Hey guys, quick question - What if I relay a transaction which gets initiated from gnosis safe? Will the transaction go through even without getting multi-sig appovals
undefined says Can someone help get started off I’m new and having hard time comprehending
undefined says What are you interested in, buddy?
undefined says @livingrock7 this guy texted me that he was having trouble with his dapp @Rocket Power
undefined says anyone have a certain setting for RSI
undefined says Need help getting an ABI
undefined says hello , is it possible to stake Bico tokens  ?
undefined says @agrozold | Biconomy banhammer
undefined says 
undefined says How does Bico handle its security? I’m needing some reassurance that using gasless won’t leave me vulnerable to a supply chain attack
undefined says Hey, we take security very seriously and make sure that even we cant do anything on the txn relay side. 
Our system is trustless by design
undefined says Not sure what you mean by supply chain attack
undefined says Hello - I just wanted to report a critical security issue found on biconomy.io - can you help me understand who will be the right point of contact?
I DM'ed @Ahmed Al-Balaghi  but he didnt respond
undefined says Hey, sure whats the issue?
undefined says do you want me to post it here to the public channel?
undefined says Let me set up a group with some folks in the team, we've solved a lot of issues lately so not sure exactly if this is new or old
undefined says Hi all,  lately I have been getting `the method eth_signTypedData_v4 does not exist/is not available\` in Chrome and Brave. It was working fine until a couple of weeks ago
undefined says I’m referring to cyberattacks originating from dependencies, eg the Solarwinds attack, the Sawfish attack, the Codecov attack.
undefined says That will depend on what's your multisig configuration.. If it's just 1 owner, transaction will go through... If it's like n:m then you need to do n transactions with different owner signature to execute the txn...

But usually in Case of gnosis contract wallet approach, u have single owner wallets so txn will go through in single attempt
undefined says Did u set the trusted forwarder properly.. Looks like either u didn't replace all msg.sender, msg.data or u didn't set correct trusted forwarder address in your contract
undefined says We'll be checking this
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy  I updated to the latest @biconomy/mexa. I am still getting `the method eth_signTypedData_v4 does not exist/is not available\` when trying to send a meta transaction
undefined says Is matic mainnet not available on Biconomy? I only see Mumbai Testnet on https://dashboard.biconomy.io/home
undefined says it should be available @Lovejeet | Biconomy can you please check this
undefined says Hey @jazn ,it is available on dev dashbaord, could you please check one more time?
undefined says hi
undefined says I want to integrate the biconomy forwarder sdk in the backend, but the docs say that we need to sign the transaction in the backend using the users private key. How and why would we get the users private key in the backend and wouldn' t that pose a security threat??
undefined says @livingrock7 can help you there
undefined says I think you may be misinterpreting the docs and we may have to include better communication in there. We dont at all use or touch the end users private keys
undefined says Yes, your help will be very much appreciated.
undefined says How should I stake my Bico in Quickswap dex presently havng it in Binance wallet
undefined says hello, it appears ive recieved BICO in my wallet but it has no $ attached? is this something new youre bringing out or it was a scam? Also called biconomy
undefined says you can check the contract of received token

undefined says Hey folks,
Do anybody know does Biconomy has an API to monitor Dapp gas tank balance?
undefined says @Yash
undefined says Would someone be able to help me with this?
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/121611/error-when-using-merkle-proof-with-a-lot-of-leaves
undefined says Is it possible to set max priority fee with biconomy?
undefined says hey, we don't have an API for this right now but it's on the roadmap. We send reminder emails (frequent) 7 days before the gas tank exhaustion on your registered email id
undefined says hey @jazn, it is not possible right now but is in the works. We ensure that the user transaction go through and hence take the most optimal price from gas oracles
undefined says hey, it would be great if you can post the query to https://forum.biconomy.io/
This will help future devs as well
undefined says in any case, Biconomy is really useful. because gas is a pain. It's a little easier now, but still.
undefined says Gm guys
undefined says I have a question or kind of a suggestion
undefined says In order to make a transaction gasless, I have to implement your interface, right
undefined says Talking in the ethereum blockchain
undefined says What if u guys make the transaction in ethereum gasless by implementing the opcodes of ethereum, it would be amazing
undefined says I will make a research about this if you are interested
undefined says Tried to swap Polygon to Eth, it got stuck on ‘exhausted retries’ while on ‘transferring Eth’ bad. It’s been stuck for a while, is that Eth just gone?
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says @jazn on which network?
undefined says Yh go for it, do look into it a bit more if it makes sense, what do you think @livingrock7
undefined says .
undefined says Thanks for the response!
undefined says Replied to you on hyphen-support group. Need details.
undefined says EIP2938 has PAYGAS opcode and there are several proposals, are you aware about them @H2O3
undefined says when you make protocol changes it requires great deal to be included in upcoming forks
undefined says Is boconomy down ? we have used it in 3 projects 2 are on testnet & one on mainnet all have stopped functioning
undefined says They were working till yesterday
undefined says Nope, I am not. Let me take a look
undefined says Can you share more details and error logs
undefined says Hey guys! How do you fall back to a normal transaction for the user when their limit is done, and get this error

```
{
    "code": 151,
    "message": "User limit reached"
}
```
undefined says @Yash
undefined says @Yash  @livingrock7 
is there any way to find out the relayer address in the end smart contract ?
undefined says is msgRelayer() safe enough to implement a critical logic in the contract?
undefined says hey @Chop you will have to catch this error in your logic and then use a different provider to pass the transaction
undefined says @Shubham could you give us some details on what you are trying to achieve, it will help us serve you better
undefined says I want to create a access modifier for transactions generated through relayer
undefined says @Lovejeet | Biconomy  ^^^^
undefined says @Moderator scam
undefined says Any dapps right now that are using Biconomy?
undefined says You can use this API:
https://docs.biconomy.io/api/biconomy-data-api/per-user-limits-data
You will get to know how much of limits are left and then can revert to a normal transaction from your end. Currently we don't support fallback mechanism when user limits are reached but we will be adding them in the future!
undefined says Which meta transaction approach are you implementing? Custom or EIP 2771?
undefined says EIP 2771
undefined says 👍
undefined says Completely missing the gas tank screen on my dapp -- can anyone help?
undefined says @Yash @livingrock7
undefined says hey, gas tank is not available for Rinkeby right now
You don't have to worry about gas there, we will take care of that
For get more information on gas tank and where all it is deployed here - https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/gas-tank-deposits
undefined says thanks for the response. running into another issue now though -- getting 
```
{
  code: 'B511',
  message: 'Smart Contract address registered on dashboard is different than what is sent(0xdd34dbaf2054aecaee192bad950d0a49a084fe35) in current transaction'
}
``` when trying to send a tx. The contract is registered on the dashboard, i've double checked. even tried deleting and adding again, adding thru API and UI. any help? would love to get this working
undefined says bump on this if you are able to help @Lovejeet | Biconomy
undefined says excited to use biconomy but just running into some of these issues!
undefined says hey @Ahmed Al-Balaghi any help on the above q - thanks!
undefined says Why does it say `not found on Biconomy Dashbaord` when it is found in there 🤔
undefined says Hey, could you check the ABI once?
undefined says Hey @Lovejeet | Biconomy can i withdraw money from my gas tank? i can't get this to work and i don't want to waste any more time
undefined says really frustrating experience, no clear documentation, slow support, janky dapp, and not able to run the examples
undefined says `not found on Biconomy Dashbaord` your error messages isn't even spelled correctly. the contract is in my dashboard
undefined says hey @tpae extremely sorry about this, we've been receiving quite a lot of requests lately
undefined says Hi, apologies, we were stuck in back to back calls. No worries, meanwhile i can try to help.
undefined says can you please send me the screenshot of your dashboad?
undefined says 
undefined says ok so both the contract have the same address
undefined says which one is the correct one?
undefined says they are the same address
undefined says which network?
undefined says can you share me the address here
undefined says can we discuss over DM?
undefined says sure
undefined says Hey @tpae, extremely sorry that you had to go through that. I hope it is resolved now. I would love to connect with you and understand how we can make our onboarding process better for you and for all the other developers out there
Again apologies, you can dm me for any further help that you need
undefined says hey I have checked the ABI, i've uploaded it throught he dashboard and the API
undefined says same result
undefined says Really frustrated, want to use y'all but it's been days now and i cannot integrate yet.
undefined says @peej I will get this resolved, connecting my technical team
undefined says please let me know... thank you
undefined says Please share the dashboard screenshot
undefined says Also, please share how you are initialising biconomy on the client side
undefined says can I DM?
undefined says Sure
undefined says please accept friend request
undefined says Thanks for the help @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy was very helpful, thanks. Would suggest adding details to the docs that if dealing with upgradable contracts you need to add the ABI of the implementation contract
undefined says Thanks, will get this incorporated
undefined says @tpae all good with you or you still need some help?
undefined says hello who can i speak with regarding an issue with the hyphen biconomy bridge?
undefined says @livingrock7 @Lovejeet | Biconomy
undefined says @aniket | Biconomy please assist sir
undefined says @OhFoSho @Divya | Biconomy will help you with that
undefined says ok ty
undefined says Hi guys, currently we are using beconomy api for gasless. it's so awesome. but in many times, we are getting 417 error when we call `https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/native` endpoint. is there anyone get the same issue and is there any solution?
undefined says hey, check this thread on our forum on this issue - https://forum.biconomy.io/t/417-error-while-setting-up-mexa-sdk/124/2
undefined says thank you! I will check it.
undefined says Hi guys, is there any local dev tools for doing meta-transactions?, if it's not then we have to do the development work directly on the test net?
undefined says hey @YC, unfortunately there is no way to do that on local machine for now. We are working on making this easier for our devs but it will take some time
undefined says OK, thanks for the reply
undefined says Hi Guys, we are using beconomy meta transaction for gassless. I have terrible situation for get transaction receipt. in some times receipt comes as `success` but it changes to `failed` in a few mins. I already changed providers multiple times but still get the same issue. is it cyrptocurrency major issue? or is there any solution?
undefined says hey @erik didn't get you there - which network are you using us on?
undefined says we are using polygon. @Lovejeet | Biconomy
undefined says great, could you try using this API to see the correct status - https://docs.biconomy.io/api/native-meta-tx/get-retried-hashes
undefined says I see it's https://api.biconomy.io/api/v1/meta-tx/resubmitted. is it ok to call this api every second after get transaction hash? or do we have to final check after get receipt in contract?
undefined says and I see status is `CONFIRMED` in succeeded transaction. so do we need to check if it's `CONFIRMED`? or is there any other status like `SUCCESS`?
undefined says with every response when you get tx hash for the first time we send recommended retry duration after which you should call this API. at least 200 blocks time for the network
undefined says yes confirmed means mined / success
undefined says got it. thanks
undefined says ic
undefined says @Lovejeet | Biconomy I have one more problem. we are getting 500 error sometimes when we calling your endpoint https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/native
Also in sometimes, we get 417 error.
undefined says If bico cannot integrate with any wallet, i think we cannot have a seamless experience. We still need native token to make a transaction between 2 wallets
undefined says We are working on the wallets front - its very important
undefined says Hey can you share your contract address and dapp name
undefined says contract address: 0xc1ecb3e2e6648ca4bda314790df67e01dde9838d
dapp name: CRUN
undefined says Got it, will check and revert back
undefined says thank you!
undefined says @Lovejeet | Biconomy it's not working
I was get `CONFIRMED`  in this api after I get receipt from contract. and receipt status was also `success`. but they are changed to `failed` after a few mins in both your api response and receipt
here's your api response that I got `CONFIRMED`
```
{
      oldHash: ‘0x25505ec9d268f4322cc39e1affb681d01bd8c4afc04f2bf8c725a50d201f49eb’,
      newHash: ‘0x25505ec9d268f4322cc39e1affb681d01bd8c4afc04f2bf8c725a50d201f49eb’,
      oldGasPrice: ‘46750000000’,
      newGasPrice: 46750000000,

      code: 200,
      message: ‘Use this new hash to serve to your users’,
      newStatus: ‘CONFIRMED’
}
```
but now it's `Failed`
https://api.biconomy.io/api/v1/meta-tx/resubmitted?transactionHash=0x25505ec9d268f4322cc39e1affb681d01bd8c4afc04f2bf8c725a50d201f49eb&networkId=137
Could you please look it? thanks
undefined says Totally agree. Make a seamless experience for every user. Let's make "gasless" be the industry standard
undefined says Some exchange like c98 want to charge fee in their token ($c98). Which way can we integrate them to provide a "gasless" experience?
undefined says Hey, have you registered this contract on the dashboard?
undefined says Or can you share your apiKey prefix over DM?
undefined says I am sorry, I can't provide you apiKey since it's private data.
undefined says sure, it's working almost time. but we are getting 500 or 417 error in sometimes.
undefined says Got it, for 417 you can check this out for more info: https://forum.biconomy.io/t/417-error-while-setting-up-mexa-sdk/124/2
Will look into 500 error responses
undefined says hey! can I use biconomy for payments portal like razorpay for my project
undefined says Hey, Is there a sample starter repo for a gasless implementation for a NFT project?
undefined says hey @curiousninja could you give some more details about the use case
undefined says hey, we don't have it for an NFT project but this tutorial will help you understand how to implement it in any smart contract 
https://docs.biconomy.io/tutorials/native-meta-transactions
undefined says where can one find the docs on running a biconomy validator?
undefined says Staking is not available yet. Plz wait for announcement
undefined says Hey guys, was looking at the SDK here: https://docs.biconomy.io/products/hyphen-instant-cross-chain-transfers/sdk and was wondering if there are methods available on the SDK to get supported networks and tokens? Not super clear from the docs.
undefined says we are making a dapp which allow user allow to mint NFT gasless and we are using Biconomy for this this. But we are getting constant error even through we are following documentation
undefined says 
undefined says @aniket | Biconomy
undefined says @Prestx00 | Biconomy
undefined says Hey
undefined says Let me have a look
undefined says Hello! Hope all is well. We currently have a MVP centralized crypto exchange/trading application where users basically try to send their assets like USDC/USDT and they can trade within our system. This is all so far so good as we are creating wallets on our server and securing them on a KMS and the amounts are virtually traded within our system (sort of like Coinbase, Binance, etc.) but currently we are experiencing some issues for withdrawal of their USDT/USDC assets out of their designated wallets we created for them for which we have to have Ether in order to transfer the tokens. Our MVP currently estimates gas, transfers it to the wallet and goes ahead with the transaction but this model is incredibly flawed as we have to pay gas fees twice and wallets will have extra changes within them and managing them is a huge hassle.  

1. Now, gasless transactions seem to be what we need BUT based on the docs, we need to write smart contracts to handle transactions and they are revolving around having our own ERC-20 Tokens rather a third party ERC-20 like USDT/USDC (?), as such, I was wondering if this is possible to do it without writing smart contracts? If so, are there any guides/tutorials, etc for this specific approach? 

2. Also, if gasless is the way to go, can we divert the signatures to our own relayer to reduce costs of transfer within the network? 

Also any help/suggestion/criticism etc.. is truly appreciated. 

Many thanks in advance. 🍀
undefined says hey, great questions - @Yash @Lovejeet | Biconomy will get back to you on thuis
undefined says Thank you very much. Looking forward to it. 🍀
undefined says Hey have you checked the docs and followed the changes that are required in the smart contract. https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/eip-2771
undefined says Hey @Grall 
1. Have a look at our Smart Contract Wallet approach via Gnosis
https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/external-wallet-support
For this you don't have to update any smart contracts
2. For 2nd point can you elaborate your implementation?
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/eip-2771#use-_msgsender-not-msg.sender
undefined says yes and now I will start from scratch
undefined says

undefined says what should i do
@everyone
undefined says Can you share your contract code in form of a gist?
undefined says on it
undefined says https://gist.github.com/AAYUSH-GUPTA-coder/c7266c5e2f999727208a10b75f64df53
undefined says @Yash
undefined says Got it, will check it
undefined says great
undefined says @Aayush Gupta 
Here is the gist of your contract, made a few changes:
https://gist.github.com/arcticfloyd1984/8e46ac89c1dd774a174c2406d1431586
Use complier version 0.8.9
A few things that are different and I updated:
1. You cant't use `setTrustedForwarder` as in `ERC2771Context.sol` it is a private immutable variable. Either you can inherit OpenGSN's `BaseRelayRecipient.sol` (https://github.com/opengsn/forwarder/blob/master/contracts/BaseRelayRecipient.sol) or locally flatten out ERC2771Context.sol and change it from `private immutable` to `internal`.
2. No need to override `versionRecipient` as that is required only if you use `BaseRelayRecipient.sol`.
3. Changed the ordering in which contracts are being inherited as that makes a difference in calling those contracts.
undefined says thanks @Yash
undefined says TravelGasless.sol i want to make mint function i.e minting gasless
undefined says 
undefined says but it is not showing any the follwing method
it may be because we do not add any `ERC2771` function in `mint`  function

```
function mint(uint256 _tokenId) 
        public
        {
         require(
            !member[_tokenId][_msgSender()],
            "You have already claim NFT"
        );    
        require(_tokenId <= supplies.length-1,"NFT does not exist");
        uint256 index = _tokenId;

        require (minted[index] + 1 <= supplies[index], "All the NFT have been minted");
        _mint(_msgSender(), _tokenId, 1, "");
        // "" is data which is set empty
        minted[index] += 1;
        member[_tokenId][_msgSender()] = true;
    }
```
undefined says what should i do
undefined says @Yash  @everyone
undefined says What is the ABI that you have registered on the dashboard when you were registering the Smart Contract?
undefined says Also did you register the Meta Transaction Type of Smart Contract to be Trusted Forwarder?
undefined says yes
undefined says @Yash
undefined says 
undefined says i am selecting the following options
undefined says and use `0x9399BB24DBB5C4b782C70c2969F58716Ebbd6a3b` as `trustedForwarder` address
undefined says 
undefined says Would require the exact ABI to check as the functions that come in the drop down on the dashboard are directly fetched from the ABI that is provided. Can you share the entire ABI
undefined says ```

undefined says @Yash
undefined says Looks like this ABI was not created from the contract that was there in the gist, hence the functions are not appearing in the dashboard. Remix has the option to generate the ABI once a smart contract has been compiled. You should use that to register on the dashboard
undefined says i used the  Remix IDE to generate ABI
undefined says shit i have selected the ownable.sol contract while copying the ABI
undefined says sorry dude for this stupid question

undefined says Hi, for the pool and farm in hyphen. Why the pools disappear after i stake the nft on the farm
undefined says I just exchanged 110 usd polygon for 110 usd avalanche, did not come to the ava network, wrote something went wrong and that's it, money is neither on the polygon nor on the ave
undefined says hey
undefined says did you make. a ticket?
undefined says While using your bridging service of HYPHEN, I lost my ETH.

I tried to change my 3.86 ETH from POLYGON network to ETHEREUM network.
Your bridge received my ETH on POLYGON network, but it didn't give any ETH to my wallet on ETH network.

Transaction ID : 
0x0752c8a65a92a49509abd31c754869623d19ad151aefd059b02fd954e74c62be
My wallet address : 0x7c7CDc7582391e4Dc8C8e91412d041b5454FDc88

Please give my ETH back!. It is totally 3.86 ETH.
undefined says Where can I make a ticket?
undefined says solved
undefined says why does the apy fee rate not correspond to what is earn to me? 3.8 eth in the polygon with 100% apy, but I received only 0.00012 ether per day, which is equal to $0.3
undefined says Hello I am using Hyphen SDK to bridge tokens from Ethereum to polygon chain. However, is it possible to bridge the tokens and transfer to the smart contract? Basically, can I give the smart contract address as the recipient address in the Hyphen SDK method? Thanks
undefined says 1000 BICO holder yay
undefined says Replied on the developer support channel for you
undefined says Hello! Thank you very much for your suggestion and sorry for the late reply. So what we essentially need is kinda like this:
undefined says TBF I'm happy to write an smart contract but the thing I was scared of was security vulnerabilities but I can see Biconomy has Audited SCs so any help/suggestion is very much appreciated. 🍀
undefined says Is this like a conditional transaction?
undefined says Hey @Grall 
What would be smart contract specs? 
this is for USDT transfer on Ethereum ?
undefined says Hello there! Well, both Wallet 1 & 2 are custodial wallets. If Wallet 1 creates a transaction, we would like to incur the costs ourselves. So it can be conditional transaction but not necessarily.
undefined says Hello! Thank you! 
- Any spec is fine because we are going to create the SCs.
- Correct! It's for USDT on Ethereum. 🍀
undefined says Great! @livingrock7 can give more info regarding the next steps
undefined says Thank you so much! 🍀 ❤️
undefined says how to add one onEvent in nextjs 

where to add this section on code in Nextjs
undefined says ```
biconomy.onEvent(biconomy.READY, () => {
  // Initialize your dapp here like getting user accounts etc
}).onEvent(biconomy.ERROR, (error, message) => {
  // Handle error while initializing mexa
});
```
undefined says Wherever you want the biconomy to be setup. Usually it is at the first logical flow where your code is being initialised in your logic.
undefined says Ok
undefined says i am basically create a ERC-1155 NFT minting dapp. I am very new to web3.  can you  plz help me to tell where to initialised Biconomy
undefined says 
undefined says You can check out our examples repo: https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Web3_EIP2771_EIP712Sign.js
undefined says There are various examples related to setting up Biconomy

undefined says Docs say I need it in this contract
undefined says ok resent
undefined says awesome,Cheers
undefined says 😍
undefined says @cRekto looks like the is a min cap of 100 USDC. Is that in production as well? Meaning that we can only bridge at least 100 USDC? 

Could you please send me more because I made a mistake and the my USDC got locked in the Liquidity contract? I configure the deposit function with MATIC instead of Mumbai for the toChainId
undefined says maybe @Yash can help you ser. I'm not sure how to help with that 😦

I am using Polygon Mumbai, gas tank balance > 3 Matic.
undefined says Hello
I keep getting this error while trying to mint, has anyone came across it ?
undefined says @Arek | Exhale Studios can you expand the error message?
undefined says Hi @Ryan_08 are you waiting for READY event to be emitted before sending our transactions? which version of mexa-sdk you're using
undefined says this happens when sdk can not decode data properly for your method

let methodInfo = decodeMethod(to, decodedTx.data);
        if (!methodInfo) {
          let error = formatMessage(

            `Smart Contract address registered on dashboard is different than what is sent(${decodedTx.to}) in current transaction`
          );
undefined says Thanks for jumping in. I actually gave up using the SDK and used the API directly. It's actually more preferable as our code is in Python.
undefined says Thank you I got it sorted ! There was a logical error in my smart contract 🙂

undefined says Hey guys, I'm building an NFT ticketing platform called TickEth.io and we're planning to keep the UX same as a web2 platform to engage the web2 native crowd as well. So currently we're creating a custodial wallet with an email login and we're the custodial owners of the wallets. Now I have a problem with the secondary marketplace for tickets because idk how to enable it for a custodial wallet when the user doesn't have access to the keys, I'm not sure how they'll initiate or complete a transaction( & paying gas fee). Can someone from the support team DM me please. I can explain the situation better and y'all can help me figure out a solution :))
undefined says please open a ticket in #🧩｜developer-integration-support

undefined says Hi there. How many token have permit function on BSC?
undefined says I want to use meta transaction in bsc but i don't know which token that biconomy support in this chain
undefined says There is no list as such. If you want to implement meta transactions on any token then look for `permit` or `executeMetaTransaction` function. That function will be having these arguments:
`    function executeMetaTransaction(
        address userAddress,
        bytes memory functionSignature,
        bytes32 sigR,
        bytes32 sigS,
        uint8 sigV
    )`
undefined says hey guys, nice to  meet you all!
i wanted to build a gasless dapp, having an erc20 token inheriting ERC2771Context. I have deployed a MinimalForwarder contract and set it as a trusted forwarder in my erc20token. I was wondering which contract i should add on the biconomy dashboard the forwarder contract or the erc20 token contract.
undefined says Hey sorry for the delay it got skipped.
Can you DM with more details?
undefined says Anyone use biconomy sdk with useDapp
undefined says Hi Everyone
undefined says Quick question
undefined says Top level documentation states there is support for Rinkeby network
undefined says But I dont see a gas station contract on Rinkeby !!! I have done a lot of testing on rinkeby and have  a lot of accounts and contracts that I cant switch fast or easily. I would like to use Biconomy also on rinkeby. how.... pls advise
undefined says Request someone to pls deploy on rinkeby also..
undefined says Gas Tanks are not deployed Rinkeby, if you want to replicate the mainnet flow with gas tanks you can test out on Kovan
undefined says Thanks Yash. BTW, to use any of the meta-transaction i.e gasless transactions feature of Biconomy , is Gas Tank a Must ? I didnt quite gather ...
undefined says no matter if we choose- standard meta-transaction or custom implementation ..?
undefined says And BTW, isnt Forward a subset of Mexa as a way to pay gas with ERC 20 tokens rather than native coins ?
undefined says And arent Gas Tanks contracts the same as forwarders ?
undefined says How do you build a Forwarder contract ?
undefined says Hey Guys, 
I am not sure if someone has encountered this issue, or this is issue with biconomy,
I have integrated `EIP712MetaTransaction` to my erc1155 contract. We were having random issues when biconomy is integrated. 
Also I am not able to transfer the minted erc1155 NFT token  to another wallet using opensea, however normal contract call to transfer works fine, and also using biconomy for transfer works .
Can someone help with this please.
undefined says gm folks, having some contract side issues on implementing meta transactions, I am using EIP2771 with personal sign, the signature is going through but then the transaction via the forwarder gets reverted https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0xa3901ce2b3bf9916c1be8b879cc4cc7c4f02bb6e176c7652737493e07f41e886
any ideas what might be causing this?
undefined says Yes depositing to gas tank is a must in both custom or EIP 2771 approach. 
Gas Tank contracts are not same as forwarders, their sole purpose is to keep an accounting of balance for a dapp.
undefined says Can you share your smart contract code on DM?
undefined says Share the code snippet where you are building the signature and sending the transaction
undefined says Can you send this with a custom gasLimit in the transaction?
undefined says It went out of gas:

undefined says this is what I'd thought, is how do I increase gas from SDK?
undefined says will try to add gas limit in txn
undefined says I'm using the SDK where I replaced my provider with biconomy provider. I'm doing ```contract.function(...args, {gasLimit: 900000})``` but this seems to be giving me some issues
undefined says I get a 500 error from biconomy api in the console
undefined says Are you using web3 or ethers to make contract calls?
undefined says ethers
undefined says @Yash shared with you in DM, please accept my friend request
undefined says I was able to figure this out thanks, it's working now!
undefined says @Yash I was wondering if we can send value with meta transactions as well?
undefined says because right now I was sending some value with the transaction and it's not going through
undefined says Cool will check
undefined says Sending value is not possible in meta transactions. As msg.value will always be 0 because it is the relayer calling your smart contract to execute the transaction.
undefined says I used openZeppelins Minimal Forwarder contract.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/metatx/MinimalForwarder.sol
but you need to use forwarder contract deployed by bichonomy,
https://docs.biconomy.io/misc/contract-addresses#eip-2771-contracts-trusted-forwarder

if you want to use your own forwarder contract, need to do extra steps.
undefined says Hey 👋🏼 I'm trying to implement gasless actions for users of my dapp.
Any articles / resources on comparing OpenGSN vs. Gelato vs. Biconomy?
(I'm aware this is the biconomy discord and might be biased 🙂 )
undefined says Hey all,
In our application we are current deploying Gnosis Safe's for each organization using our App. We would like to add Biconomy support for Safe transactions, as currently we are airdropping tokens to users which is fine as a band-aid but not sustainable long term. 

Referring to this documentation (https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/external-wallet-support/gnosis). Ultimately, we would like to do two things. 
1. Pay gas for users signing a multi-sig transaction 
2. Pay gas for executing transactions through the Gnosis Safe

Does anyone know if the Gnosis contracts support this already, or if there are already deployed proxy contracts from Biconomy that we can use (we are on Polygon for reference). 
Any help here would be appreciated
undefined says If I want my own set of tokens to pay for gas, how to do this?
undefined says Do I understand correctly, that the user calls forwarder, forwarder calls trusted forwarder, and trusted forwarder calls the actual contract?
undefined says Do I understand correctly, that I need to replace only the forwarder?
undefined says Does biconomy relayer not support gassless txn for paid nfts
undefined says hello everyone, the biconomy api that I have been using for 2 weeks without any problems is currently giving http 408 error, does anyone else have this problem?
undefined says Hi. I am new to biconomy and the Mexa product which supports gasless transactions through forwarder and gas tank  concepts . We are using standard UDSC/USDT transfers for our application. So I want to know if I can use transfer USDC/USDT from wallet A to wallet B through Biconomy MEXA ?
undefined says part 2- we are using polygon network, so if this works on polygon or ethereum only ?
undefined says Do I understand correctly, that if there is a contract X that we need to call and there are several Forwarder contracts, I can call X through any of the Forwarder contracts (and on this will depend token used and gas price)?
undefined says "developers need their users to permit (or approve where permit is not supported) the  contract to spend tokens on their behalf" - but it seems being impossible without the user having gas token. So the user needs some gas token to "bootstrap" gasless transactions?
undefined says Anyone else have problems using Biconomy sdk and react? I’m having very weird behaviour when instantiating Biconomy in useEffect. It only works when the dev server is reloaded with the page open.
undefined says Replied on Telegram
undefined says Yup saw it and working on the solution atm, thank you!
undefined says Why `bp` takes only 10000 values? it looks like not enough precision! Or maybe I misunderstand something?
undefined says Didn't understand , can you elaborate?
undefined says Hey this should be fixed
undefined says someone told me that the gasless txn only works for free nft purchases and not for paid ones
undefined says Meta transactions itself has a drawback in accepting native tokens for gasless transactions. If the payment happens in ERC20 tokens then you'll be able to purchase them as a gasless transaction.
undefined says is this because you cant make the relayer pay only the gas and the user pay the price in one txn?
undefined says Right, for this is if you make the function payable, then msg.value would be the one coming from relayer which would be 0.
undefined says What is the reason for this error that we encounter frequently?
undefined says is mumbai not supported network?
undefined says Checking this
undefined says Yes it is a supported network
undefined says when i am running my code with mexa calls, i see a lot of biconomy related output , not sure where it is coming from... how can i disable it
undefined says i think thats the debug flag while init
undefined says u r right. thanks
undefined says folks, I am having trouble initializing biconomy instance with wagmi
undefined says I am using provider to initialize but it's not having a signer
undefined says Hey have a look at this code snippet:

`// Pass connected wallet provider under walletProvider field
let biconomy = new Biconomy(new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("YOUR RPC URL HERE"),
  {
    walletProvider: <Wallet Provider>, 
    apiKey: <API Key>, 
    debug: true
  });`

You can pass a json rpc url and a provider that has a signer in the walletProvider option
undefined says Hi all, I'm currently testing a Biconomy app on Rinkeby and noticed theres no way to deposit rinkeby Eth into the app from the dashboard. Is there a faucet for rinkeby thats attached, or am I missing something for rinkeby? For reference I can see a place to deposit MATIC when running a dApp on Polygon.
undefined says Hey @Tejalapeno you don't need a gas tank on Rinkeby. The transactions would still go through without it. You don't need to deposit the native tokens.
undefined says I've been using biconomy mexa sdk lot these days, I was wondering if y'all could add type defs to it, it'll be very helpful
undefined says Yes we are adding type definitions in our new SDK, which would be out in first week July.
undefined says Hi all, working on adding contracts programmatically using the dashboard API and calling those transactions. We are having issues with this as everytime we try and send a tranaction registered through the APIs, we are getting the error that the address can't be found on the dashboard, however looking at the dashboard online you can see the registered contract. 

Any help would be appreciated.
undefined says Hey @Tejalapeno , are you waiting for the ready event while initialising biconomy instance?
undefined says I’m using the SDK on the backend, so I haven’t waited for the ready condition. Is it necessary is in the backend?
undefined says Yup you'll have to do it
undefined says Did anyone use Biconomy gasless transactions on Gnosis Chain?
undefined says Dashboard update is clean
undefined says Hey, I have been trying to stake my Bico and it’s just not working… I connected the wallet, but then when I try to stake, it fails. Any tips?
undefined says Hello. Can someone help me by answering a question about biconomy. I'm trying to add a new app api method but it doesn't appear when using sdk. Does it have a delay of some sort?
undefined says Hey, are you waiting for the ready event?
undefined says Yeah, i just saw that it night have to do with the method not being ready for meta. Its the approve of stables so
undefined says hey, so I'm getting unpredictable gas estimation on polygon mainnet even though I'm manually passing gasLimit while using meta txns
undefined says this is what I'm getting on production on polygon mainnet. any ideas how to fix this?
undefined says I'm manually passing gas as well
undefined says Replied on tg
undefined says Hi @Yash. Which contract methods need to be added into the Dashboard? It's not too clear from the docs. I've only added mint() as that's a write method - but any read methods like totalSupply(), cost() don't work. Please can you help?
undefined says I get this too, when I call  `estimateGas()`..

```
let provider = biconomy.getEthersProvider();
  let gasLimit = await provider.estimateGas({
    to: CONFIG.CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    from: userAddress,
    data: data,
  });
```
undefined says It depends on the meta transaction approach you are doing. For 2771 Approach you have to add the methods directly like mint(). For read functions there is no gas anyways involved right, so you don't need to register those ones and can be called directly
undefined says Thanks a lot - that’s what I assumed. Could I be seeing that error because of something else, eg a failing require() inside the mint() function?
undefined says There are multiple reasons for failure in gas estimation. You can have a look at this forum thread to get a better understanding: https://forum.biconomy.io/t/417-error-while-setting-up-mexa-sdk/124/3
undefined says I’ll have a good look, thanks. I’m using EIP2771.
undefined says @Yash FYI - I’m building this capability for a global company, Unilever. Gas-free NFTs could be a huge bonus for them. Biconomy looks perfect - really hoping it works for us
undefined says Can you share your telegram handle? We can have a group where I can connect you with more members from the Biconomy team.
undefined says Thanks. `@hzlosan` on telegram
undefined says Hey i'm having an issue integrating biconomy with a nodejs app

error: {
    code: 'B511',
    message: 'Smart Contract address registered on dashboard is different than what is sent(0xce9e7cad2dd786bab9fc1868a41334af801d1deb) in current transaction'
  }
undefined says Can you cross check the address registered on the dashboard and the one that you are using to send transaction to?
undefined says Guys, this is great integration with Timeswap! 
web3 for people ❤️
undefined says Hello, are there any best practices for allowing gasless deposits of ERC20 tokens into a protocol?  I'm running into an issue where the `deposit` goes through gasless fine but I have to pay gas for the `approve` .  Having to add the ERC20 contract address for each token my protocol supports to the list in `/dapps/***/smart-contracts` and then the `approve` method for each of those contracts in `/dapps/***/dapp-apis` seems unsustainable if/when ERC20's are being added/removed from my protocol.
undefined says Hey, we have public apis so that you can add smart contracts (ERC20 tokens) and methods (approve/deposit etc) dynamically. https://docs.biconomy.io/api/dashboard-apis
undefined says For approve function not working in a gasless way, can you share the logs of your browser when you do the approve?
undefined says My gasless transactions through biconomy are taking alot of time , i would like to increase the gasPrice should i do that in transaction parameters or where , any help would be appreciated 😁
undefined says Hey guys! Facing the same issue as @devil14  ^^. Additionally the transactions are getting dropped or failed (I'm testing on polygon testnet) any help would be appreciated!! 😄
undefined says @vedWhat if u find a solution please let me know , will do the same 😁
undefined says getting CORS error , while trying to connect to biconomy through sdk , anyone else getting the same issue on polygon mumbai?
undefined says @devil14 @vedWhat checking this issue
undefined says @Yash not being able to add api's now too , it keeps giving Meta Api could not be added in db error
undefined says And i created a new dapp with the same smart contract with another account , it doesnt give me CORS error on it
undefined says I have added a domain to the allowed list, I'm still getting the 

```
code: "B500"
message: "Requests from this Domain are not allowed"
```
error. Is there a period of time that needs to pass before the whitelist is propagated?
undefined says Hi team! Thanks for the great documentation! I have 2 questions about it.
- The list of Supported Network is inconsistent in the MISC section: https://docs.biconomy.io/misc/supported-networks#10.-avalanche-testnet-c-chain and the Gasless Transactions section: https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/networks-supported. 
Basically the difference is on Avalanche. Is it supported for gasless tx now?
- The discord link in the contact page is off: https://docs.biconomy.io/comm/contact-us
undefined says And also would like to ask if there is any page with more details about the pricing on the service? Thanks!
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy
undefined says Hey thanks for bringing this up. Will get this fixed.
Yes Avalanche is supported for gasless txns
undefined says Thanks! I also would like to ask if there is any page with more details about the pricing on the service?
undefined says can you check again it should be working now
undefined says Hi, I have an issue on Hyphen, my funds are bridged to eth mainnet from matic, but they are not received and there are no on matic, admins, could you  help me?
undefined says Hello Biconomy team, would like to bump on this question. Appreciate it!
undefined says Hi Biconomy team, could you share the development progress of bcnmy/mexa-sdk-v2 with us if it is not too much trouble, look forward to use sdk with typescript version, thank you very much!!
undefined says Hey, let me check with the team
undefined says The new sdk would be live early next week!
undefined says Hey guys, wanted to know if biconomy is looking to add support for zk rollups like starknet?
undefined says Hey @Pratik | Mande Labs what support specifically are you looking at for ZK rollups?
undefined says The gasless feature
undefined says Anyone here who has worked with the SDK in vue3?
undefined says @Shruti | Biconomy
undefined says Currently you can use Biconomy's Gasless infrastructure free of charge. The only cost you need to bear is the gas tank top up price
undefined says Guys this has been a recurring issue on my vue app.
As soon as I import @biconomy/mexa this error pops up.
Can someone point me to some solutions
undefined says I have tried various versions of ```@biconomy/mexa``` but all in vain
undefined says Checking 👍🏻
undefined says Heyo 👋 , was making a gas-less ERC721 minting daap but ran into an error
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/131633/erc720-token-is-minted-to-relayer-contracts-address-instead-of-msgsender-wit

Someone who has worked earlier with biconomy for meta-transactions?
Would love if you look into it


Whenever I hit the mint function with _msgSender(), instead of minting it to the original request sender's address, it mints it to the relayers contract's address
Did I configure my biconomy API's incorrectly?
undefined says Why can't I unstake my  staked bico?
undefined says did you stake on Safety Module or Hyphen?
undefined says https://staking.biconomy.io/unstake this site
undefined says Thanks to Yashasvi for taking his time out on Sundays and helping me out with this one, you guys da best 🤩✨
undefined says how can a platform facilitate a trade for a collection which supports gasless transaction like zedrun with biconomy?
undefined says You can start by going through the docs

https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771/2.-code-changes/api

I'm reading this, and I would like to know what message to sign so I can submit the transaction to the API manually.
undefined says Any worked used ethersjs to interact with biconomy???

Please drop your repo url
undefined says I have some integrations working pretty nicely via etherjs
undefined says I dont have a public repo tho
undefined says what are you looking to do?
undefined says I get unsupported provider error when i try to call a method
undefined says I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong
undefined says I think the issue comes from line 131
undefined says 
undefined says hmm
undefined says I think at like 123, you want what you have at like 132
undefined says window.ethereum -> web3 provider in your case
undefined says then use the biconomy based provider for the signer
undefined says If I use the biconomy based provider for the signer I get “unsupported provider” error
undefined says Please can I see your code, how you implemented it, so I can know where I’m getting it wrong
undefined says This same error
undefined says Im not using that init interface
undefined says I created a hook,
```
const useBiconomy = ({ apiKey, debug, contractAddresses, strictMode }) => {
  const [isInit, setIsInit] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const provider = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // process.browser is nextjs/SSR specifc
    if (process.browser) {
      (async function () {
        if (window.ethereum !== "undefined") {
          // Create biconomy instance
          const biconomy = new Biconomy(
            new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum),
            {
              apiKey,
              debug,
              contractAddresses,
              strictMode: true,
            }
          );

          provider.current = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(biconomy);

          biconomy
            .onEvent(biconomy.READY, () => {
              setIsInit(true);
              setError(null);
            })
            .onEvent(biconomy.ERROR, (error, message) => {
              setIsInit(true);
              setError(message);
            });
        } else {
          setError("Ethereum provider was not found!");
          return;
        }
      })();
    }
  }, [process.browser]);

  return [
    {
      isInit,
      error,
      provider: provider.current,
    },
  ];
};
```
undefined says Which version of biconomy are you using
undefined says Maybe I will have to downgrade it
undefined says used in code like,
```
const [{ isInit, provider: biconomyProvider }] = useBiconomy({
    apiKey: "<API KEY HERE>",
    contractAddresses: [<CONTRACT ADDRESS>],
    strictMode: true,
    debug: true,
  });

const methodToCall = async () => {
      if (!isInit) {
        console.error("Error with gasless claim. Try again!");
        return;
      }

      const signer = biconomyProvider.getSigner();

      const contract = new ethers.Contract(
        "<CONTRACT>",
        "<ABI>",
        signer
      );

      try {
       // Ensure method is added to biconomy dapp api w/ contract and abi
        const transaction = await contract.someMethod();
        await transaction.wait(1)
        // success stuff
      } catch (error) {
        // error stuff
      }
  };
```
undefined says `"@biconomy/mexa": "^2.0.35",`
undefined says Ok let me try it now
undefined says It’s working now
undefined says Thanks 😉
undefined says Sorry I’m here again, where do you think this error is coming from?
undefined says I got it after I signed the message
undefined says either your tx was going to revert or you just need to set a gasLimit on your contract call
undefined says I tried setting gas limit on contract call still the same
undefined says I have added the method to be called to biconomy and have funded the wallet , im not sure where the issue is from perhaps the contract
undefined says Can I see see your contract code please
undefined says I Followed you on Twitter
undefined says Hey, it depends on your use case and signature style. Can you explain more on what you are doing and what are you making gasless on DM?
undefined says Hey @revShell do DM me if you are still facing issues.
undefined says Hii , discord says I can’t dm you
undefined says Can you send a friend request
undefined says I just did
undefined says I messaged you already
undefined says I've added you
undefined says @Yash actually, could we move this to a thread? I'm very bad at keeping track of DMs because of how much stuff I get.
undefined says Hey, It depends on you contract and what type of signature you are following.
undefined says We can use any signature
undefined says Basically we have a server in Rust that needs to send gasless transactions
undefined says There is a port of ethersjs in Rust, https://docs.rs/ethers/0.6.2/ethers/index.html
undefined says So all I need to know is what payload I need to sign
undefined says I know you can do either regular messages or EIP-712
undefined says the former would be less headache
undefined says sorry, was meant to reply to you there
undefined says Okay so lets say you want to have a custom eip 712 sign, you can create a dataToSign and sign it using the rust ethers lib. This example might help
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_Custom_EIP712Sign.js#L215
undefined says That's very useful, thanks! What about the non-eip-712 version
undefined says It should be a bit less of a hassle if I can just concat a few bytes
undefined says Sorry, I meant as in what I need to sign to submit to the relay API endpoint.
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771/2.-code-changes/api
undefined says i think it depends on your implementation of contract, if you are implementing eip2771 personal sign then just a object in js/ts for rust should be like  
```rs
let functionSignature = rustEtherContractInstance.encodeFunctionData("smartContractFunctionName", [smartContractFunctionParams]);

let rawtx = Object({
   "to": String("0x..."),
   "data": functionSignature,
   "from": String("0x..."),
})
```
so you have to sign this raw tx, and pass it to biconomy instance or api

cc: @Yash
undefined says Hey @Emerald 
You can go through this JS file for submitting transactions on relayer API in case of EIP 2771 and non EIP 712 version (personal sign):
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/fdcf5293f76b30422f14510584064134e28e2961/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_API.js#L217
undefined says Yo, this is very useful, thanks very much
undefined says If I'm going to be submitting lots of transactions inflight at once from the same signer address, is it ok if I simply pick a random batchid every time?
undefined says and then set batchnonce to 0
undefined says Have an incremental batchId and send those transactions
undefined says Multiple threads are going to be sending transactions concurrently
undefined says Do they actually have to be synchronised using some sort of atomic counter

undefined says Hey,
How does scalability works on Biconomy?
Like, I was told it has no limit, meaning that I will be able to do, for example, 2000 transactions per second. Is that true?
undefined says Shouldn't I pay more if I use more? Also, where this APIs runs? Server-less/Lambda?
undefined says I am doing a technical evaluation on Biconomy, Defender and GSN and just would like to understand more about how Biconomy can scale, as we have plans to use it for a big project
undefined says Any help will be very welcomed, also if some tech person from Biconomy could jump on in a call with our team would be great 🙂

undefined says Hey, can you share error logs?
undefined says Seems tricky to me, as relayers are are like any other eoa
undefined says Ideally your code should not rely on one or other relayer.. coz relayers accounts are dynamic on our side.. we have more than 10 - 300 relayers depending on the network.. what is the requirement here to put this restriction on smart contract?? From the dashboard you can be ensured that whatever method you register, only those methods are called via our relayers...

undefined says Hi all, can someone help me understand transaction resubmission? When will a tx be resubmitted?
https://docs.biconomy.io/api/native-meta-tx/get-retried-hashes

So the tx hash changes.

undefined says i have try with direct call with my wallet, it correct and successfully executed, but got 500 error in api call, this result of my direct call from my wallet, not from master wallet : https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0xe94f9265bdc4e61e7916c6c843dcde1a7a3c8f5ae238081bc4f0a284d88c38d3
undefined says another question
undefined says how to replace `window.ethereum` for backend sdk usage ?

i mean this script from docs `https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771/2.-code-changes/sdk` :

```
const biconomy = new Biconomy(window.ethereum as ExternalProvider, { apiKey: config.apiKey.prod, debug: true, contractAddresses: [<contractAddress1>]});
```

because in backend is no `window`
undefined says @Rhic | Biconomy
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy can you help here?
undefined says hey you can pass the provider like this https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Web3_EIP2771_API.js#L87 

basically you can pass any provider you have in backend which have same methods as per EIP-1193 ExternalProvider
undefined says but i have use nest-js, its based typescript code
undefined says i cant pass them
undefined says what provider you are using
undefined says but how about this ?
undefined says i want to use JsonRpcProvider with ethers
undefined says looking into this, will get back
undefined says using mumbai rpc
undefined says i think this script is reffered for dapps or frondend usage
undefined says not backend usage, backend usage must put private key on script
undefined says yes if you see line 137 there's a function onSubmitWithPrivateKey for backend usage
undefined says but biconomy provider still use window.etherum here, you might see here : https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_API.js#L96
undefined says i think it still confusing me how to replace window.ethereum with pure JsonRpcProvider
undefined says it's better im waiting for good news with API method
undefined says you don't need to pass the walletProvider as config, as we are passing the jsonRpcProvider which has the signer, no need pass the walletProvider
undefined says but how to send transaction without signer ?
undefined says if i call contract method directly using ethers ?
undefined says in typescript is requirement to replace JsonRpcProvider to ExtendedProvider type
undefined says how to pass them in typescript ?
undefined says you can see in the function you are giving the signer with private key on line 177
undefined says can you try this

```ts
let kovanProvider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
  "<provider>"
);
biconomy = new Biconomy(kovanProvider as any as ExternalProvider, {
  apiKey: config.apiKey.prod,
  debug: true,
  contractAddresses: [config.contract.address],
});
```
undefined says i will try them
undefined says hy @Aman | Biconomy
undefined says this code will push to API, check here : https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Web3_EIP2771_API.js#L410
undefined says i still face this issue
undefined says this still not answer my question
undefined says hey, i was trying to analyse bridging times of hyphen, however when i looked into data, i saw multiple bridging transactions with negative time difference , i.e starting timestamp is after ending timestamp
eg : 
ETH to Arbitrum bridge : https://hyphen-stats.biconomy.io/search?depositHash=0x158ffc0745e831c87a8745350a7ce2301be5199907c35d4173567860c924cf4e&network=Ethereum
Optimism to Arbitrum bridge : https://hyphen-stats.biconomy.io/search?depositHash=0x5d6df77fe89429832947fac30844f5b07e8cdd5e4fb8a2c94523341ecd0436c5&network=Optimism 

In the Hyphen UI, I do see time difference between bridges shown. Is there a way to offset these negative balances or is there a internal database keeping track of these values
undefined says Folks, where is the pricing for using a relayer? I want to do 20k transactions in an hour, how can I see costs?
undefined says @Moderator sorry for the bump, but where is the pricing for using a relayer? I want to do 20k transactions in an hour, how can I see costs?
undefined says Do you mean Gasless ser?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Please check this article: https://biconomy.notion.site/Biconomy-Pricing-3ec98394b01741558c6493be6061effc
undefined says Wonderful, I'd like to purchase the first tier. How do I get started?
undefined says Hey guys! I'd love to discuss Hyphen's security with a team-member. Who'd be the right person to talk to? I have some concerns I'd like to point out. 

Cheers!
undefined says TypeError: _biconomy_mexa__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5___default.a is not a constructor
undefined says getting this error, while trying to add biconomy object to the frontend.
undefined says Hey! Could anyone help me better understand how gasless works with the smart contract wallet approach?
undefined says Let's say I'm not able to update the contract on my dApp. Do my end users need a smart contract wallet in order to use my gas relayer? How does their wallet or smart wallet make calls to the dApp / smart contract? Thank you!
undefined says Hey @Aman | Biconomy can you look in to this?
undefined says DM me
undefined says Thank you mate, I will ^^
undefined says Hey this is relater to using latest version of react which supports webpack 5, as webpack 5 doesnt support polyfills

undefined says you can checkout how to configure it here to fix this
https://github.com/bcnmy/gasless-playground/issues/2
undefined says Hey, did you resolve this issue. I am getting exactly the same issue.
undefined says Hi, I am a web3 account exec at Chainalysis, I'd like to have a discussion with the security team, who can I dm? thanks
undefined says ser @Aman | Biconomy , could you reach out? thanks
undefined says Hey @Aman | Biconomy can we please add collaboration in biconomy dashboard? Only one of our team members has access to dashboard and if he is not there it causes a bit of a problem
undefined says Hi Anoushk, currently even if you don't have dashboard can add contract and add methods via apis but I get what you mean. 
Will ping the product team about this, looking at the bandwidth we will pick this in future.
undefined says Thanks Aman, we already use Apis but some times that fails
undefined says Hi guys, for 3h I have been struggling with the unsurprising and not detailed `error`: `registered on dashboard is different than what`.
I searched this entire discord for similar problems and I know it is because of not being able to decode the `tx`
undefined says I triple checked the address, followed the docs to the dot, even went into the `mexa` code to debug, no success.
undefined says Please help
undefined says Hi guys, any help?  😄
undefined says hey folks, I am using Biconomy SDK for mexa, the newer one. for some reason if I initiate the txn and it fails, it clears out the biconomy provider so that I cannot do another txn
undefined says Hi, I wonder that when Hyphen will support more tokens than current 😁
undefined says how did you solve this?
undefined says hey, folks here is your chance to visit the web3 conference in Dubai 🤩

RT + share the word for a free 🐫 ride 😛
https://twitter.com/0xTPH/status/1580895119133532162
undefined says Hi would a Biconomy dev be able to hop on a call with me? Our gasless mint works on testnet but on polygon mainnet it does not work.
I believe it may be a bug with Biconomy's dashboard confirguration or a gas estimation issues (underestimating the cost) If anyone knows how to increase the gas estimation amount using a stardard trusted forwarder call please let me know
undefined says Can we isntall biconomy on angular?
undefined says has anyone else ran into:
```
{
    "name": "Error",
    "message": "Forwarder domain data is undefined",
    "stack": "Error: Forwarder domain data is undefined\n    at Biconomy.eval 
}
```

using:
    "@biconomy/mexa": "^3.0.4",
undefined says @blakewh were you able to get on a call? If not LMK and I can connect you.
undefined says hey did you manage to get this solved?
undefined says he managed to get this done, we made a group between him and our devs and they did a couple hundred gasless mints recently
undefined says Hey all 👋 

Is there any example of how to use @biconomy/mexa 3 on backend? Can not find a way to acquire ExternalProvider that is required to initialize the SDK
undefined says @Yash or @Aman | Biconomy can help here
undefined says Hey. @rjborba 
Currently V3 does not support backend integrations. We have that in pipeline and would be out later this quarter.
For now you can use version 2.0.38
undefined says Hello, I have a question about Conditional Whitelisting, I saw 2 models in the docs that included NFT and Token, but I want a model where the user must have a specific role (openzeppelin AccessControl), is this possible?
i used gsn before and i wrote check access in WhitelistPaymaster contract.

thanks
undefined says hey @smuggler what do you mean by user must have a specific role ?
undefined says something like admin/owner?
undefined says You can check out this - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-docs/blob/master/demo-docs/learn-about-access-control.md
undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy  , I know about access control let me explain our project . In our project, we have the planter role and we want to support the gas costs of our planters. I saw in your docs that we can send NFT to our planters to whitelist them. Now my question is, is there any other solution? (for example instead of checking they have that NFT we check their Role to send gas less  tx)
undefined says I mean that people with specific role(in my case planter role) can send
undefined says @Rhic | Biconomy @Rohan Garg | Biconomy Can you confirm over this?
undefined says You can do conditional whitelisting, take a look
https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/conditional-whitelisting
undefined says Not sure what you mean by role, and how that information is stored
undefined says He is talking about access control - as far as I know he is looking for solution where we have granted access to declared roles and then send gasless tx to them

undefined says Can someone help? I get the error when I execute the contract method, `executeMetaTransaction`
undefined says That's great to hear! Is there any additional work that needs to be done out of the box or could I add it to bare project
undefined says I am reading this section (https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/connect-wallet) specifically right now and it says `Get the EOA provider for choice of your wallet which manahes (sic) your signer` and it doesn't specify which packages you are using but from what I gather ethers.js and an unknown provider (wagmi, web3.js??)
undefined says Sorry if these are noob questions, I am very much a beginner in web3 development
undefined says good question, we will improve the docs, 
it just means you can use any wallet connect package doesn't matter. cause after connecting users connects with a EOA (Externally Owned Account) or user address. Now you just have to pass that userAddress/EOA to SmartAccount package
undefined says Okay I think I can work off of this. Thank you so much Aman!

Please help me 🤧
undefined says Hello just have a basic question regarding the biconomy dashboard.
Can we withdraw the token we have deposited as the gas for a dapp?
undefined says Yes you can
undefined says @Divya | Biconomy
undefined says Hi @Yash , I can't find the option can you please guide me a little bit also thanks for replying.
undefined says All transaction are processed now. There was some system issue which was solved 10 hours ago. You funds should be on the exit side. Please check.
undefined says You can also search here 
https://hyphen-stats.biconomy.io/
undefined says Hello, I am using Biconomy SDK to integrate gas-less transactions. Here's what I am doing 👇 
```typescript
const wallet = new Wallet(
  decryptText(userAddress.private_key),
  this.ethers,
);
const smartAccount = new SmartAccount(wallet.provider, {
  activeNetworkId: this.getChainId(),
  supportedNetworksIds: [this.getChainId()],
})
await smartAccount.init();
```
But it is giving me the error that `wallet.provider` is of type `Provider` while required type is `Web3Provider`
undefined says I am doing all this on server side so I do not have type `ExternalProvider` which comes from Metamask
undefined says Anyone? Please help? Is this sdk ready to use on server side?
undefined says ```ts
import Web3 from "web3";
import HDWalletProvider from "@truffle/hdwallet-provider";
import SmartAccount from "@biconomy-sdk/smart-account";

const infura = "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<api_key>";
const pkey = "<p_key>";

const main = async () => {
  console.log("start");
  let provider = new HDWalletProvider(pkey, infura);  
  const walletProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider);
  
  const wallet = new SmartAccount(walletProvider, {
    activeNetworkId: 5,
    supportedNetworksIds: [5],
  });
  const smartAccount = await wallet.init();
  console.log(smartAccount);
};

main();
```
undefined says Regarding batched transactions, I was wondering if we can batch transactions from several wallets/users into one single transaction? For example, we could execute all ERC20 transactions every minute in batch. [waiting max 1min to see your transac executed is acceptable when you are not in a hurry]. That could potentially allow for a large gas fee lowering
undefined says Thanks brother 💜 
Appreciated
undefined says Yes, as far as batch transactions, its possible
undefined says Biconomy's SDK has got the batch transaction covered, you can check it out here @David75 - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/batch-transactions-via-sdk
undefined says Also, it will leave you with one click experience so do check it out and let me know if you are facing any issues while implementation
undefined says That is awesome! I imagine a world where metamask would do that to dramatically lower our gas fee
undefined says With biconomy, its possible ! lower gas fees !!
undefined says happy buidling!
undefined says Hello admin
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy please check my DM
undefined says Hey guys!
I'm thinking of using Biconomy's Hyphen for cross-chain communication
I think Hyphen is a bridge protocol, but is it possible to send only messages without sending assets?
undefined says Hi guys !
i try to use "Sponsor Gas Fees For Your Users" but the exemple is not complete (don't know what to put inside tx1 : the signed transaction from metamask ?) do you have a complete sample on git ? the exemple seems to be on server side because on front side i have error when import smart-account ```Module not found: Can't resolve 'net', Module not found: Can't resolve 'tls', Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'```
undefined says i found this https://github.com/bcnmy/gasless-playground but it seems to be outdated because use @biconomy/mexa and not what the doc use @biconomy/smart-account here : https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/sponsor-gas-fees-for-your-users
undefined says Sure @Abhijeetcg checking !
undefined says Hey, do you mean transaction as message ? Also, about the cross chain transactions/ Cross Chain Contract Calls & Asset Transfer is about to come soon as per the new SDK.
undefined says Hey you can check this doc out for sponsoring gas fees for your users. Pls make sure the package are installed properly, if you still face a problem - tag me on this channel or #🧩｜developer-integration-support
undefined says Also you are using mexa repo for the code ?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy i just try to use "Sponsor Gas Fees For Your Users", iset up in your backoffice easily but now i have to implement on my own code, but with the doc it's impossible to implement, lack of exemple or information, there is a complete exemple ? front and back (if needed)
undefined says i did yarn add @biconomy/smart-account but when i import SmartAccount from "@biconomy/smart-account"; in my react page i have error with fs module
undefined says Try using both :
undefined says yarn add @biconomy/smart-account​  or​ 
npm install @biconomy/smart-account
undefined says i did yarn add @biconomy/smart-account​
undefined says Did it install successfully ?
undefined says yes
undefined says https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/user-onboarding-and-smart-account-deployments
undefined says See if you are missing out any step related to smart account and around deployment
undefined says If the error persist through your react page, there might be some additional changes required on package.json
undefined says when i add just the first line 
import SmartAccount from "@biconomy/smart-account"; 

i have the error

undefined says hey the `fs` `tls` `net` are all polyfill errors in react, you can configure webpack to solve these issues
a short solution is this

https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk/issues/140#issuecomment-1200841818
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says it seems to fix thanks, i go forward
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy   now the line ```const txResponse = await smartAccount.sendGasLessTransaction({ transaction: tx1 });````
 tx1 come from where ? 
I created in your backend "Dapp APIs" the method "mint" linked to my contract abi "mint" how my user call/sign transaction gas free to this method ?
undefined says can you check out this example. This will explain how we are sending batch and single transactions

https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-demo/blob/staging/src/components/UseCases/AA/SingleTransaction.tsx
https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-demo/blob/staging/src/components/UseCases/AA/BatchTransaction.tsx
undefined says i will take a look thanks
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy  i have a http 400 when post to  https://sdk-relayer.prod.biconomy.io/api/v1/relay  "code":400,"error":"{\"reason\":null,\"code\":\"CALL_EXCEPTION\",\"method\":\"simulateValidation any idea ?
undefined says this is this ApiKey to put here  ??```networkConfig: [
                {
                    chainId: ChainId.POLYGON_MUMBAI,

                }
            ]````
undefined says or this API ID
undefined says Dapp api key should be there on dashboard
undefined says i put 2 screens of the dashboard which one i have to use ? the APi Key or the API ID in Dapp APIs
undefined says api key
undefined says ok i try the first and the secodn but i have always error 400
undefined says got it, getting back to you
undefined says i can dm you the log
undefined says in log i find sender: "0x00BeED6D966Fc60a27263EEAD23FC18CBeAE69B8" but this address is not my wallet, not the contract and i don't find it on mumbai.polygonscan, normal ? it's seems to be smartAccount.address
undefined says Gm Folks!

I have been trading in crypto for ~12 months now. I was using BlockFolio to track my investments across exchanges. 

With the recent FTX debacle ( to which I lost a good portion of my portfolio) I am now looking for portfolio trackers that are convenient to use and can help me track all my assets accurately in real time. I have already tried most of the known ones and either they are paid, inaccurate or are loaded with too many unnecessary features. Looking for something that is low gimmick and have portfolio tracking as their main proposition.

It would be nice if they also offer taxation reports as per US standards (again most of the available once require hours of manual intervention)

Would be really helpful if you can drop in your recommendations. 
Thanks in advance.
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy  we don't use your onboarding for user (login process, we use the classical metamask connect) we don't need that part just the gasless part, it can be explain the issue ?, because i try your sample and it works, the difference is the login process we haven't on our side, we use like this ``` const walletProvider = await new providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
            let smartAccount = new SmartAccount(walletProvider, options);
            smartAccount = await smartAccount.init(); ````
undefined says i tried with Meta Transaction Type "custom" and "forwarder" in dashboard, same issue
undefined says Hey is there any video on how to setup the Social login?
undefined says I find it difficult to do so with the documentation
undefined says a little confusing
undefined says Can any one please help me here i was trying setting up some simple meta transactions but some incompatibility error https://gist.github.com/nlok5923/8103bfc951bd991141381cefdb64b8d0
undefined says I tried this approach but it didn't worked out
undefined says with the new SDK you mean?
undefined says You are using Web3 Auth package - for setting social logins 
https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/enable-social-login-for-users
let me know what is your exact confusion.
undefined says hey so first of all these errors comes because of react polyfill issue. You need to configure webpack peoperly.

but regardless if you are implementing gasless transactions you might face issue as, there are 2 things in new sdk demo, 
- forward flow - users paying gas fee in erc-20 can be done without any key
- gasless flow - Account abstraction flow, dapp developers will deposit in paymaster to make tx. While the new dashboard in [wip]. You can use they same key we have used for paymaster to try things out.
undefined says Thanks looking into it.
undefined says can checkout this example
https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples/tree/master/react-biconomy-web3Auth
undefined says can smart contract wallets sign transactions?
undefined says Smart Contract Wallets are used to batch transactions and build customized transactional journey for Dapps.
The power to sign the transactions lies solely with the EOA that is the owner of the respective SCW.
Hope that helps.
undefined says You can read more about that here:
https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/additional-content/smart-contract-wallets
undefined says I am trying to make the following approach to call my smart conrtact. I am on Mumbai testnet. Everything works except the sentTransaction part and it gives me the following error.
Please help me out.
undefined says Should I use @biconomy/mexa or @biconomy/smart-account? Is it different? I saw @biconomy/mexa in some earlier video.
undefined says For using Gasless transactions,
Using the old-docs should be preferred for now
here: https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions
undefined says Thanks @Manav | Biconomy @Aman | Biconomy I'll try these out and reach out again!
undefined says Sir when i trying to unstake tokens from hyphen it shows error... please help me
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey @shujip  if you are trying to achieve meta transactions for gasless - you can go ahead with mexa directly
undefined says Smart account are for setting up SCW for your EOAs, you can use the link provided by Manav.

Happy buidling @shujip
undefined says Hello, I can do gasless  transaction now. But I got a error message:

undefined says Hi Biconomy, I tried initialising the smart account following the guide on https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/user-onboarding-and-smart-account-deployments

As per the guide I installed smart account using  npm install @biconomy/smart-account. But I get the following errors. Kindly help me with it. Thanks.
undefined says This is the dreaded polyfills error. You will face similar error while using web3.js as well. I solved this issue using `react-app-reqwired`.  
1. npm install react-app-rewired
2. Create a `config-overrides.js` file. The content of the file are as follows. Install the required packages (those used in this file)
3. In package.json for start, change it to `react-app-rewired start`

am new to biconomy. I am working on a dapp in nextjs and i want to do gassless transaction in my dapp.
as given in the documentation, i added erc2771 in my contract and created api in dashboard
need support to fix the error to initialize the biconomy. adding screenshot of my code and error
undefined says Hey @sabir-118 , this is a polyfill error in react, you will require to configure the webpack for solving this issue.
undefined says What you can do is create - `overconfig-overrides.js` file and have this code in it

This should solve your problem @sabir-118
undefined says Hey there..
undefined says Hello !
undefined says Can you pls help me out about how to integrate Biconomy social login in React js project.
undefined says Hey @Dhruv , check out the social login doc of biconomy , where you can integrate web3 auth directly in your codebase 

https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/enable-social-login-for-users
undefined says Here is an example for the same - https://github.com/bcnmy/hyphen-ui/tree/demo-sdk
undefined says Let me know if you face any issue!
undefined says Okay let me give a try, thanks 😊
undefined says Hey Team, 

How's it going - I sent a message on LinkedIn about helping out with hiring. 

I come across the project through my network and heard some great things! 

I've been helping with desirable projects across the ecosystem, including Layer 1's, Layer 2's and DAO's. I am helping mainly across Protocol, Blockchain Architecture, Rust Engineering, Solidity Smart Contracts, Development (Frontend, Backend) and DevOps.

Who would be the best person to speak to in regards to hiring?
undefined says Hi Team, i have one nft which i havn't burned yet, can i still burn the NFT to get the bico?
undefined says The old reward link is not working anymore
undefined says HI Biconomy!
I am Psych from the Polygon DeFi team. The research and publication wing has mentioned you in their article titled "How Zero Knowledge Proofs, Aggregation Layers, and Light Nodes Can Improve Web3 Experience and Structure?"

We thought it would be appropriate to share it with you. Feel free to provide feedback and share it around!

https://polygontech.medium.com/how-zero-knowledge-proofs-aggregation-layers-and-light-nodes-can-improve-web3-experience-b06e434c09e9
undefined says Hi Biconomy, Are the new SDK on https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/introduction/overview functional. Or we have to develop according to the old docs at https://docs.biconomy.io/. Kindly let me know. I am planning to utilize social login and gasless transaction as per the new sdk. Thanks 🙂
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy Thanks for the response. It worked for me. I was able to initialize the Biconomy instance. 

Am confused with the next step also. I have to initialize the web3 with biconomy instance right?
undefined says const biconomy = new Biconomy(library.provider, { apiKey: 'api-key', contractAddresses: ['contract-address'], debug: true });
 await biconomy.init();
const web3 = new Web3(biconomy);

Should i initialize like this?
undefined says I think the new SDK is not yet fully ready for public use.
undefined says Hey there
undefined says as soon I import   " import SocialLogin from '@biconomy/web3-auth'; " i'm getting error like this
undefined says and also this in console : index.js:6 Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
undefined says Trying to solve from last 3 hours  😦
undefined says Hey Tommy, let me check with team and see if this could be some help!
undefined says you can ask this in #🌐｜dao-chat  @mocha
undefined says Hey Psych, wow this is awesome - thanks for sharing this !! Will give it a look ! 🤝
undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy  thanks for your response, looking at the live roles I can help with all tech-aligned openings so keen to have a chat. I tried addressing this in the dao-chat but I do not have access.
undefined says While the dashboard is wip, you can explore social login and gasless transaction, also you will have to use api keys accordingly.
undefined says Okay mam, So we can use social login and gasless transaction using the new SDK right?
undefined says While you are accessing account abstraction flow, also you might find error like fs, net which are polyfill errors so dont be worried about them
undefined says yes you can
undefined says Okay no worries tommy, ill give it a look
undefined says Can you kindly help me with integrating social login in react
undefined says You can go through this - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/enable-social-login-for-users
undefined says Thanks mam, In the first step in this documentation it asks to import  @biconomy/web3-auth, but what are the packages we should install mam. Should we create a smart account (https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/user-onboarding-and-smart-account-deployments) first to use social login
undefined says Thanks for your help, can I send you a DM with the details?
undefined says you only need to import smart account if you want to use the smart account package. The social login can be used simply for social login and get the EOA.

can checkout this example starter code 
https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples/tree/master/react-biconomy-web3Auth
undefined says Sure @Aman | Biconomy. Will checkout. Thanks
undefined says Hey Biconomy Team,  I'm Suhrad Makwana, from Stabel Technology.

I was wondering who I can reach out regarding partnership between us at Stabel and Biconomy ?
undefined says Hello please help me out if it is working out for you to implement social login in react js🙏
undefined says Hi @Dhruv, Kindly use this code as starter template - https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples/tree/master/react-biconomy-web3Auth. It works
undefined says Needed packages, overrides are done there. Thanks
undefined says Okay let me check.
undefined says Hi guys, maybe a dumb question, but I'm trying to integrate Hyphen into our app and the scenario I have is:

User gets USDC via the on-ramp
Put user's USDC into Liquidity pool

Now that seems straightforward enough to me, but I want to be able to do this on the same chain, not cross chain, is that something I can do with Hyphen?

For example using the Mumbai testnet, how can I add funds to the liquidity pool?
undefined says You did this login with typescript ?
undefined says Hello, I have a contract on polygon testnet. I am trying to send ERC20 token with gas-less transaction through Biconomy SDK. This is what I am doing
```typescript
const provider = new HDWalletProvider(userAddress.private_key, chain.rpc_url);
const walletProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider);

const smartAccount = new SmartAccount(walletProvider, {
  activeNetworkId: this.getChainId(),
  supportedNetworksIds: [this.getChainId()],
});
await smartAccount.init();
const erc20Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
  'function transfer(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount)',
]);

// Encode an ERC-20 token transfer to recipient of the specified amount
const data = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData('transfer', [
  deposit.depositToken.address,
  process.env.HOT_WALLET_ADDRESS,
  deposit.amount,
]);

const tx1 = {
  to: process.env.HOT_WALLET_ADDRESS,
  data,
};

const txResponse = await smartAccount.sendGasLessTransaction({
  transaction: tx1,
});
console.log(txResponse);
```
undefined says After this line
```typescript
const txResponse = await smartAccount.sendGasLessTransaction({
  transaction: tx1,
});
```
It gives me this error
undefined says 
undefined says I also noticed that I am providing my biconomy API key no where in this code
undefined says Yes. Need to check with react JavaScript alone yet. Will let you know bro
undefined says Hey guys, 

Having difficulty catching txn hash generated from biconomy on behalf of user on our dapp.
undefined says Want to use API, not the SDK.

Following API doc, we applied EIP2771 in contract. 

Following API doc, we got the signed transaction, sending POST request on API (along with 2 required parameters)
But the response is either:
- dapp id not registered
- parameters incomplete (while both parameters are sent)
- unpredictable gas error

All errors carry code 417
undefined says Yep! Thanks! It will be helpful if that is on React.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says hey, is there any example of sending tx, sign msg (using @biconomy/mexa) along with social SDK? (demo integration or sample code)
undefined says Hi, Can we use bicoomy smart account sdk with polygon main net?
It seems that polygon main net doesn’t support account abstraction yet.
undefined says @Psych Guy Thanks for sharing, we'll be having a look!
undefined says Hey @Suhrad you're at the perfect place, reach out on TG here :
https://t.me/manavkampani
We can discuss this further there!
Thanks
undefined says Hi @schmoopy 
We are happy to help with any type of questions around Biconomy. 

The Hyphen bridge is used to transfer assets across EVM (currently supported) chains.

What you really are trying to achieve here is a little unclear to me. 
Can you explain your issue more?
undefined says Sure, DM’ed 🙂
undefined says Hey @PJijin 
the social login feature is not supported with the legacy sdk (@biconomy/mexa).
For that you'll have to leverage the new SDK.
https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/enable-social-login-for-users
undefined says Using the new SDK I can do the auth process. How does the sign message, and send tx work with that sdk? do I need to use mexa along with the sdk? Is  there any code sample available?
undefined says Hi Guys,
Do you need smart contract, protocol audit, bug bounty.. ? I work with Hacken a web3 cybersecurity Auditor. We  have more than +1070 clients, years of experiences and worked for big companies like Vechain, Kucoin, Solana etc…
If you are interested I can send you the presentation deck.
undefined says Hello everyone!
Where can I find pricing?
undefined says What about React js ?
undefined says So currently we are testing the Account abstraction flow on test networks, we will be deploying it on mainnets with the new launch of dashboard
undefined says pricing for?
undefined says Have you referred to our docs here: https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/signing-transactions
undefined says Hey Biconomy Team, I'm with Superfluid

One of our main contracts implements the trustedForwarder() standard and has set Biconomy as a trusted forwarder, but we haven't really gone too deep into the process of documenting it or directing our developer community toward using it yet.

I'm in the process of playing around with biconomy now, and I've gotten tripped up a few times in your docs. One question I have currently:

I'm looking at this page, and am trying to use SDK 3, but I don't see any docs about what 'SDK 3' is or where I can install it. https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/sdk-3

My job to be done is: use the biconomy SDK to sign a tx and use the relayer service for meta transactions. I might be looking in the wrong place to solve this, but any help would be greatly appreciated!
undefined says SDK 3 refers to the new SDK released recently.
It seems a little ill-fitted on these legacy docs, will get it rectified.
Here are the docs for the same : https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/introduction/overview
undefined says Got it. So do users of the new SDK have to use smart contract wallets? Or can I still make use of the trustedForwarder() implementation on my contract (i.e. as advertised in the old SDK/docs)
undefined says Hey dude, im also trying to find a solution. Are you able to track the executed hash for transaction biconomy does after signing a transaction?
undefined says Hi.... Tried going through the docs
where is useWeb3AuthContext coming from ?
searched the sdk and its not there
https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/connect-wallet
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy @Manav | Biconomy @Vanshika | Biconomy see if this can be resolved asap, as Valist guys wants to showcase their demo using Biconomy at Eth India
undefined says Also @waterreptile19 you can check this once

undefined says Maybe @Manav | Biconomy @ardhold | Biconomy  would you have an answer ?
undefined says Can we add pair programming channel in this discord...so we all can learn together on the SDK?
undefined says Not right now, but working on it...

My issue is that, I think I need to be passing in an API key to get my tx done with biconomy, but every time I try to execute it I get a 401 error (not authorized)
undefined says cc @Manav | Biconomy do you guys ever have any office hours open? I am deep in the weeds here and could use some help
undefined says will get back to you ser
undefined says Hey @Naitik Sharma , already on it. 
Will be added soon
undefined says Hey @Sam F | Superfluid , thanks for your patience.
Can you describe the issue you are facing in a little detail if possible?
Like whether you are using the mexa SDK or the new Smart Account SDK.
What network are you on.
Maybe the code snippet causing the error and the error msg.
Would be happy to help.
undefined says gm 👋🏼 is there any public info on how mexa SDK will be maintained in the future? and when will Smart Account SDK be released for polygon mainnet?
undefined says I get 417, cant get txns
undefined says Hey Hi everyone, I found 0x853bfD0160d67DF13a9F70409f9038f6473585Bd this contract address in biconomy repo. This is on Kovan, do you guys have similar on goerli or mumbai testnet?
undefined says Hi I have a problem. When I do a transaction I get an error: "I didn't do the gas estimated " Look:

undefined says Hey there, wanted to ask a general question here regarding the fiat on ramp. What kind of payment options are there in central asian markets, especially kazakhstan? And is there even fiat on-ramp support for these central asian markets?
undefined says @biconomy team we need help with latest sdk 

We aren’t able to find the factory contract address on docs (It seems not to be updated), we tried running a demo app to get the smart wallet address so we can backtrack it to factory but we noticed the demo app initiates contract wallet only on polygon mainnet, goreli & testnet but not on Eth mainnet we added chain and tried doing it still fails


We need an Ethereum mainnet smartcontract wallet address of a user who has connected his wallet 

Please guide as we at ethindia are completing the project and biconomy use case here is one of our target
undefined says It would be helpful if you can just share even a smartcontract wallet address on mainnet

undefined says seems avax reward pool is empty and needs to be refilled
undefined says can you get the team to refill it asap please
undefined says if we use social login by biconomy sdk, and user logs in via email, can we retrieve user email using any method?
undefined says Hey @M. , so apparently Avax side reward pool is empty, I have informed the team about the same, they will have to refill the rewards pool. this would be done by tomorrow - please check it in a day or two.
undefined says Thanks
undefined says If you are talking about saving and retrieving user email/data - we dont have that methodology, being a self custodial wallet implementation, none of that data is saved. Hope that answers your doubt
undefined says Cool, thanks. Yeah that will answer my question.
undefined says Hey there!
we have been using the @biconomy/mexa SDK in an React App to issue gasless transactions
today a weird bug started happening, the meta-txn API succeeds in sending our transaction to the mining pool,
but the block explorer (in this case polygonscan, mumbai testnet) says the following

***This txn hash was found in our secondary node and should be picked up by our indexer in a short while.***
undefined says has anyone seen this issue before?
I researched a little about it, and it seems like increasing the gasPrice could solve it
how can we increase the gasPrice manually when sending a transaction via @biconomy/mexa? (or the meta-txn API)?
undefined says This is not an issue or error related to Biconomy. It is the way that polygan scan indexes transactions
undefined says Hi guys, may be you could help me. I'm trying to integrate gassless transactions to our Angular app. We have smart contracts. Problem is that integration works find for React sample, but don't working with Angular app which is wired. So, i'm connecting wallet, init boconomy, trying to call smart contract function via biconomy, it's opens metamask, i'm clicking "Sign" , metamask is closed and that it. Nothing happed. I see in the network that request "https://gasless-meta.prod.biconomy.io/api/v1/native" is canceled, but i don't see any reason. Don't see errors, nothing. Debug: true, trying everything, but can't find root cause of the issue. May be you saw it previously or may be do you have an example of using biconomy with Angular?
undefined says The issue could be solved by increasing the gasPrice. But it seems like currently we can't do it when using biconomy/mexa, right?
undefined says It's a downside to using it, even if only during high traffic times. Made our team consider putting biconomy aside for the time being.
undefined says I opened an issue on github for it, will track progress/responses there.
undefined says Problem here is the same smart contract/api key/contract name working fine for React code, which is really strange.
undefined says Hey, thanks for sharing this - can you possibly share your source code as well /
undefined says Web2 like onboarding question

1. Can we give user the option to transition from web2 login to web3 by storing backup seed phrase? For example they don't want to use Google anymore and choose to use Metamask instead. (Transition from web2 to web3 login)

2. Can users connect their Metamask, Coinbase, etc wallet (Adding web3 wallets to web2 login)

3. Does Biconomy create a wallet and a public ETH address for new users that we can associate to the users account in our dapp?
undefined says Hi I am using Biconomy with Thirdweb to implement gassless transactions for claiming NFTs. When I claim an NFT a prompt shows up from Metamask with only  a hash in the signing message that needs to be approved by the user. My understanding is that signing message / hash comes from the Biconomy API. Is my understanding so far correct? Is there any way to customize that message to give users more context?
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey, thanks for these questions:
1) web2 social login flow will create a different EOA as compared to web3 metamask which will result in a different Smart Contract Wallet address. And we also don't store any private key or seed phrase for the user to back it up in metamask.

2) Yes they can!

3) We just create a Smart Contract Wallet, the ETH public address can be come from any other wallet like you mentioned in point 2.
undefined says Hey! Yes in a way it does come from the API. It follows the specs of PERSONAL SIGN. There is no way to customise it as it is encoded on the smart contract itself
undefined says Thank you 🙌. I have seen that you mentioned web3auth in your documentation. What is the difference between their and your SDK for on click login?
undefined says No difference, we use their SDK inside our SDK
undefined says Hello guy anyone can help me
undefined says Hey @Phu, What help are you looking for? Can you please provide details
undefined says yes pls explain your issue
undefined says hey @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says Hey @regalboys pls tell ?
undefined says hey can we talk about business in dm?
undefined says sure
undefined says nice please check your dm
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy Hey can I use the new biconomy smart account to trigger a function written in my contract and it should be gasless?
undefined says 8 days ago I used bungee.exchange choose Hyphen bridge BSC to Arbitrum1 225 usdc  i still not received

please help me check. thanks.

undefined says hey Dank - drop me a DM, will take a look
undefined says Done!
undefined says I have registered a smart contract on the Biconomy dashboard but when I am trying to call a method of the smart contract using the SDK (2.0.35) I am getting error "Smart contract registered on dashboard is different than what is sent in current transaction". I have verified I am sending the correct smart contract address
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey guys, I'm trying out meta transactions for my existing contract, I did certain modifications as told in the docs. My contract relies on msg.sender for some functions. How can I get this behavior(getting the sender's address) for meta transactions? when I try using  `_msgSender()`, it uses the relayer address in my contract, not the address of who signed it. do I need to verify the signature in the contract with `ecrecover` and validate it? or any other way around?
undefined says Hey, could you please share your code as well

undefined says I will go through this and revert to you.
undefined says Hey @Salman , I think you are making a mistake while declaring constructor
undefined says `constructor(address _trustedForwarder) ERC2771Context(_trustedForwarder) {
        trustedForwarder = _trustedForwarder;
    }`
undefined says Can you implement this in your code and check if its working - keep me posted about the same @Salman
undefined says Tried it. it is not working. if the trusted forwarder initialized wrongly, the transaction may not go through right?
undefined says Btw, is there any way where we can withdraw deposited gas funds from dapp before deleting it on biconomy dashboard?
undefined says If you are using the wrong trusted forwarder, your transactions would go through but the wrong user address would be extracted. Hence make sure that they trusted forwarder you set is the one that we mentioned in the docs.
undefined says Yes you can do that on mainnet
undefined says can you guys pls confirm that `_msgSender()` will give you the address of the sender, not the relayer address? if so, why not use `_msgSender()` here in this tutorial to get user address instead of ecrecover? just out of curiosity. https://docs.biconomy.io/tutorials/native-meta-transactions/enable-native-meta-transactions/smart-contract/modify-respective-function
undefined says So the simple explanation to this is that - for regular transaction we use msg.sender, but for meta transactions you need to take care of GSN relayed calls. On relayed calls, msg.sender will be the Forwarder contract instead of your user. So in order to get user address, having _msgsender is the right approach
undefined says Also, msg.sender is more of a transaction parameter that can be inspected by a contract to determine who signed the transaction. but for a meta transaction using just msg.sender is insufficient.
undefined says I knew that. but my question is whether `_msgSender()` function we have in the contract represents the user address or the forwarder address? for me, it is not giving the address of the sender(basically our dapp user)  who actually signed that transaction. hope you get it.
undefined says should be sender address, if thats the case - could you share your code as well as what you are getting ?
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says hey guys
The number of chains available in Biconomy's SDK is less than what is listed in the documentation
How can I use chains that cannot be obtained with SDKs such as Moonbeam?

undefined says Hi Guys! I hope you can help me. I implemented a contract and a frontend web3 app to allow me to send bep20 tokens from my account to another account. My account does not have funds but has 1000 tokens. 
to Transfer the tokens i have written this function:
    function transferToken(uint256 value, address _to) public {
        require(
            token.transferFrom(super._msgSender(), _to, value),
            "Transfer failed"
        );
    }

I get the error reason: "execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance", code: "UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT", method: "estimateGas"
Do you have an idea how i can solve this ?
undefined says @Dev Support
undefined says Hey guys I'm kind of a noob and was wondering if there was a video on how to pay a transaction with an ERC20 token with ethers.js.

Would really appreciate any help
undefined says Hey @MONKE , you might want to check out for understanding purposes - 
Ethers.js Tutorial - Sending Transactions with ERC20 Tokens" by Traversy Media:

undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey @Vanshika | Biconomy can you help me?
undefined says yes tell me !
undefined says I got a tx stuck for almost 12h… it’s a significant amount - this was done via LiFi
undefined says okay, can you provide more details ?/
undefined says Yes
undefined says It’s this tx - https://snowtrace.io/tx/0xa74bb4e826cd1c5ee5434d58004ceda3736e2815cd6319670030156fc10be219
undefined says Basically it’s WETH that is waiting to be transferred to ETH on MainNet from Avalanche
undefined says I checked the contract and it’s basically just sitting there
undefined says Maybe the large amount triggered some more checks
undefined says I was told this might need to be pushed manually
undefined says Hey @Aziz Khalledi (API) , i see you have enough tokens but not the funds, iIf the account does not have sufficient funds, the transaction will fail and the error "transfer amount exceeds balance" will be thrown.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy, what do you mean the account has not sufficient funds ? Let me explain my situation better: my wallet has 0BNB, 10000 Tokens. I want to transfer the tokens to another wallet without funding my account with BNB. I made a Contract extending ERC2771Context, in which i initialized the Token with the token Address. Then i made a function Transferto(to, value){token.transfer(to,value);}. I deployed the contract and added it to the dashboard, added the transferto function to the Dapp Api. I funded the Dashboard with 0.6BNB. In my Dapp i call the Transferto function with the parameter my second wallet and amount of tokens, like 10. Metamask will be opened to sign the transaction, after it willbe signed i get the error in the Console: Transfer amount exeeds balance.
undefined says Alright, please share me your contract code and contract address/ any snippets that i can look at in my dm
undefined says Hey everyone, I was integrating the biconomy Mexa SDK but facing,

undefined says Hi,

Just wanted to check if biconomy creates same or different wallet for different social logins of same email id

undefined says Hello, I'm trying to implement the ERC-20 Forwarder. The demo on your github is with Kovan network. How can I find the right contracts for Goerli or any other testnet? I want to build a service where user sends USDT and pays for gas using USDT as well.
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/erc20-forwarder-demo
undefined says This is the one I'm trying to build.
undefined says Thanks 🙏 team is mostly asleep now but will answer in a few hours.
undefined says Thank you very much. I'll be waiting for you answer
undefined says Any news?
undefined says Hey this is the doc erc-20 forwarder 
https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-paying-gas-in-erc20/erc20-forwarder
Here you can find forward examples
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/tree/playground/example/react-ui/src/components
undefined says Ok the problem is your contracts are for Kovan
undefined says Kovan doesn't exist anymore
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/erc20-forwarder-demo/blob/main/src/utils/TokenWallet.js
undefined says There are these contracts
undefined says const tokenAddress = "0x4F96Fe3b7A6Cf9725f59d353F723c1bDb64CA6Aa";
const feeProxyAddress = "0x78122426ee7a6D35f15c4095b4Aa72A2A6418202";
const transferHandlerAddress = "0x4AB0652B1049607F9E51E61144767d1C978950d0";
const oracleAggregatorAddress = "0x025d39AA202A552487ac9282dC343773cb60bbB5";
undefined says You have these in your documentation
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/misc/contract-addresses#ethereum-mainnet
undefined says How should I use these?
undefined says Should I test on the mainnet?
undefined says I guess feeProxy and FeeManager are the same.
undefined says Which one is transferHandler
undefined says hey yes so the mexa-sdk forwarder is only deployed for the mainnet, you can try with this, or you can try out the new sdk via which you can do forward transaction via smart contract wallets https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/build-with-biconomy-sdk/gas-paid-in-erc20-tokens
undefined says Hello all,

Need some help with the gasless transaction, for me the integration works fine where i need to call the smart contract function with one parameter but it does not work where my contract function accepts 2 parameter
undefined says i get transaction hash and no error, but when I check for that transaction on the polyscan it returns nothing
undefined says Hey, can you share the error and the contract code ?
undefined says I think you might be having an access to transaction id and not the transaction hash.
undefined says well there is no error returns we actually get the transaction id
this is the hash returned '0xaef3e55c4386e505281d638d5b923e903de50bdc8b92ca72fe8efc0d91928209' on transaction but data is not altered in the blockchain
undefined says got it, can you share the contract code ?
undefined says https://github.com/Dygnify/DygnifyDapp/blob/master/smartcontracts/contracts/protocol/OpportunityOrigination.sol
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy you can check this as well - https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0xe96ae878ac86fca09a7fb779922ef7a463f2867d5875cac89af5a590aa1a041d
undefined says i think original transaction is reverted and only pay master got executed
undefined says Hey i am using biconomy for a gasless transaction.......how can I use two api I'd in one thirdwebprovider....
undefined says Right now i can only use one
undefined says Hey @Aditya | Biconomy
undefined says May be an easy question. I want to use/test biconomy to transact my NFT assets from one wallet to another using 3rd wallet as gas fee paying. My assets are on BSC and Polygon.
undefined says You can do that easily
undefined says Also need to ask whether is it effective against sweep bot?
undefined says Social login looking really smooth. Love the integration with web3auth. Any thought about how to integrate it with wagmi?
undefined says Can I use Biconomy to transact those NFTs which I'm not a creator but I bought from different creators? Specifically mentioning that those NFTs were not minted by me nor i bought from Biconomy.
undefined says I want to use the app just to resolve my issue. I need a rescue through a 3rd party gas station solution.
undefined says Great to know! 🙏  Let me confirm about wagmi.
undefined says this could be interesting for you https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector/pull/27 . imo this is a good way to implement a plugin with wagmi
undefined says Hey @kunwar.eth 
That's not the correct section to find the api-key you're looking for.
Head over to the overview section where you will get the unique api-key you need while making the calls.
undefined says I wrote apiid not apiKey in the query
undefined says Yes you can .....you just need the contract address and abi for it
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says May I know which repo of thirdweb you're working with and and for what  purposes is the api-id required?
undefined says https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/biconomy-gasless-guide/

This one
undefined says Hey @heavydev 
we'll soon be putting up an example about integration with wagmi after looking into it.
Thanks for the query
undefined says thanks for sharing this!
undefined says How can I join biconomy...
I am from uttrakhand and want to join😅
undefined says Folks any idea why am I getting `API not found for method update
Biconomy.js:2548 Strict mode false
Biconomy.js:2548 Falling back to default provider as strict mode is false in biconomy` for previously working gasless demo example ?
undefined says I see, 
actually this implementation you are following is built to be thirdweb specific designed by them only.
It would be more appropriate for you to maybe ask this query on their server, they could help better.
undefined says So is there any biconomy repo which allows more then one gasless transaction on same web page?
undefined says Are you waiting for the Biconomy.Ready event to be fired?
https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/fdcf5293f76b30422f14510584064134e28e2961/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_EIP712Sign.js#L99
undefined says I was trying to follow https://github.com/shahbaz17/biconomy-web3auth-example this repo for web3auth integration with biconomy
undefined says If you've registered your dApp on the dashboard, you might have seen that it's actually customisable, the limit you want to put on the number of gasless txns you want to be catered on per user/per some-time-period
undefined says basis
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Yes you can, connect to Biconomy using the SmartAccount object, use the contract address and ABI for the NFT contract. Use the ethers.Contract constructor to create an instance of the NFT contract, passing in the contract address and ABI as arguments.
undefined says Cool but why not try to follow the official docs instead?
https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/enable-social-login-for-users
undefined says Hello, just wondering it that's normal that in my dashboard some transactions are still PENDING but they actually have been successfully mined in the blockchain
undefined says 
undefined says Hi,I got a problem when I invoked this api:https://data.biconomy.io/api/v1/dapp/gas-tank-balance.
undefined says Well with the same auth token.I added proxy contracts.
undefined says 
undefined says So pls tell me why I got this error.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says is the token being sent in correct way - can you possibly share contract code ?
undefined says Hi, I am having trouble integrating auction on a nft
undefined says After executing finaliseERC721Auction, I am passing data in sendTransaction function where Biconomy.provider.send is giving me error

undefined says Yes
undefined says 
undefined says Hello Happy new year!!!
I have one question.
I am trying to send erc 20 token without gas.
undefined says but I am getting 400 error
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Please help me
undefined says HNY @Blockchain Killer 
can't see the Smart Account instance initialized, 
are you sure to have initiliazed it?
undefined says Yeah
undefined says 
undefined says with my dapp api key
undefined says @Manav | Biconomy
undefined says where did you get this dapp api key, the old dashboard keys will not work for new sdk account abstraction gasless flow, try using these keys
https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/react.js/setting-up-smart-account-with-social-login
undefined says if so , we can't transfer gasless token in mainnet?
undefined says it support only test networks?
undefined says no currently ERC4337 gasless flow is only live on testnets. We will be launching on mainnet soon.
undefined says umm
undefined says can you make sure you are passing the contract address and abi correctly, if so please dm me the dapp api key so i can investigate it
undefined says yes i am passing correct keys, also i have sent you dapp key in dm
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy
undefined says Can i pay using erc 20 token instead of eth for gas fee when transfer token?
undefined says 
undefined says it didn't lanuch yet?
undefined says hey so this pay using erc 20 token is available in the sdk right now, in this method the user pays the gas fee not the developers. The custom paymaster was for like support any random fee token. Currently you can use forward to pay make transaction and users pay gas in USDC, USDT,.. and some other tokens option.
undefined says So it is in mainnet available?
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy
undefined says nope
undefined says How long does it take?
undefined says Nope we are live on 7 major testnet - we are yet to get confirmation on mainnet launch in terms of date. Late January is suspected.
undefined says Okay
undefined says hey really stoked about the new sdk changes, just a couple of Qs:
* Will paymaster work to pay gas for both social login accounts and metamask accounts?
* Until the sdk is on mainnet we still have to use trustedforwarder approach. Will this still be supported in the new version of the dashboard?
undefined says Awesome thanks, what exactly you liking about the new sdk changes?
undefined says we can do gasless erc20 token transfer with trustedforwarder?
undefined says you can, but this is limited to older version - https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771
undefined says you mean?
undefined says I need to transfer usdt token
undefined says in new sdk flow the older EIP 2771 implementation is changed - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/sending-transactions/gasless-transactions/sending-erc-20-tokens

this happens through smart account implementation
undefined says so can i transfer any token?
undefined says with old sdk
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says yes, you can still use the old sdk with trustedforwarder approach for token transfer
undefined says It is given in documentation
undefined says can gas fees be deducted from the smart contract directly, without having to top up the gas tank?
undefined says transfer function is available?
undefined says becuase usdt contract is using msg.sender in transfer function
undefined says like this
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy  ?!?
undefined says on polygon, the USDC itself supports the meta transactions
you just have to register that token contract and call its functions

the withAuthorization supports meta transatcions
https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174#writeProxyContract
undefined says but msg .sender is not my address

undefined says hey guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBPoVs66CxE&t=736s&ab_channel=NaderDabit I am trying to learn social login using biconomy from this video; but when I try to host it on vercel; social login using google or facebook doesnt work neither email
undefined says @Aman | Biconomy
undefined says Is it possible to do batch transactions with SDK3?..
undefined says got this error while implementing the trusted forwarder 
previously it completely work but now at the moment when I have to submit it for production I got this error 
Please help me
@Vanshika | Biconomy @Manav | Biconomy @Adrienne | Biconomy • DAO Lead @trevor | Biconomy @Syed Zelani Biconomy OG @agrozold | Biconomy banhammer @Rhic | Biconomy @Aditya | Biconomy @qucha | Biconomy Freak @Biconomy_Nihil
undefined says hey, are you getting any error messages or anything?
undefined says this is what I have been getting; I tried resolving those but could'nt find any help on how to approach this; thanks for replying
undefined says I tried whitelisting my vercel site as given in the docs; but that didnt help too
undefined says yes, I think their docs need updating it should be done this way:

```
      const signature1 = await socialLoginSDK.whitelistUrl('https://your-domain.com');
      await socialLogin.init(ethers.utils.hexValue(ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET), {
        'https://your-domain.com': signature1,
      })
```
undefined says actually depends on what version of the SDK you are on, what version are you using?

The SDK had a new release about 5 days ago with api changes
undefined says or any other method  to receive ERC20 token from the user as a payment method with Meta transaction
undefined says 0.0.4
undefined says using the latest sdk too
undefined says ok, so for 0.4.0 the code I shared above should work, for 1.0.0 or later this should work:

```
      const signature1 = await socialLoginSDK.whitelistUrl('https://your-domain.com')
      await socialLoginSDK.init({
        chainId: ethers.utils.hexValue(ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET),
        whitelistUrls: {
          'https://your-domain.com': signature1,
        }
      })
```
undefined says but am still getting the same error
undefined says hmm I just tested this out and it worked fine for me, are all of your dependencies on 1.0.0?
undefined says i am trying out with your dependencies and will update
undefined says still getting this; can I send my git repo to you?
undefined says I am doing the exact same thing as in your github repo; directly copying it
undefined says still getting the error
undefined says Hey guys, do you happen to know if biconomy is rate limited? i know OpenZeppelin Defender Relayer relays 120TX/hr, what about biconomy? i know it has a limit that you can configure but you can basically input any value there, does that mean biconomy will be able to handle large traffic?
undefined says hey, I updated my repo recently to use ^1.0.0 earlier today

https://github.com/dabit3/biconomy-social-auth
undefined says sure just share a link to some public code and I'll have a look
undefined says hello all. I heard that soon we would have incentivized nodes programs? or am I mistaken please?
undefined says yes you can, with new biconomy SDK - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/build-with-biconomy-sdk/batch-transactions
undefined says @aak can help
undefined says Hey @nader thanks for helping with this - is the query resolved ? let me know if there are extra hands required
undefined says because of gasLimit
undefined says Please set gasLimit config
undefined says ex : gasLimit : 30000
undefined says I am trying to send usdt token without eth
undefined says using biconomy
undefined says any solution?
undefined says check #deleted-channel for the answers
undefined says @Aziz Khalledi (API)  Hello
undefined says I have dm'ed you my repo link; thanks for helping out;
undefined says gm fam! I'm getting this error. What can I do?
undefined says Hey, this is a webpack issue, to configure please go through this link - https://github.com/bcnmy/gasless-playground/pull/1/files
undefined says Thanks! Is it possible to load the biconomy web3auth component in _app.tsx?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says I am really urdent
undefined says Hey i seem to be getting error that is also related to stream (Writable) , "Uncaught TypeError: Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null", this happens on Vite though, any workarounds you can suggest?
undefined says Hi there, I'm confused by the documentation, I would like to implement gasless transactions in the backend of my app, however I do not know which doc to follow? 

https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/build-with-biconomy-sdk/gasless-transactions
https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions
undefined says Hey @Edreldor so you can implement gasless through new sdk, the documentation is this one - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/build-with-biconomy-sdk/gasless-transactions
undefined says https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/react.js/gasless-transactions/gasless-single-transaction 

just sharing one of the guides in react.js implementation - you can check out others as well based on your backend stack
undefined says yes, you can
undefined says thanks, I am just a bit confused, I do not see any signing from the user in this new documentation.

Is there a way to build the metaTx in the front-end with ethers.js and then call an api where the metaTx will be send through the SDK on behalf of the user?

if I understand correctly, the metaTx are send so that the sender is the address whose private key is used to init the `smartAccount` ?
undefined says my concern is that if I build it on the front-end the api key would be exposed, I'd prefer to keep it in the backend
undefined says Is there any example about how to do it? I searched in a lot of repos in GitHub but most of them use the same methods you use in the examples.
undefined says > Is there a way to build the metaTx in the front-end with ethers.js and then call an api where the metaTx will be send through the SDK on behalf of the user?

Hey so you can create transaction or transaction array and pass it smart account package with the provider and we attach the smart contract wallet transaction and then users signs it.

> if I understand correctly, the metaTx are send so that the sender is the address whose private key is used to init the smartAccount ?

Yes correct
undefined says so once the new dashboard will be launched there will be address and method whitelisting. Also you'll be able to restrict the dapp api key to be called via your domain where the frontend is deployed too. Like it happens currently in mexa-sdk flow.
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples
undefined says thanks !

would you also have some code example of how to achieve that?
with front-end not using the sdk but a front-end that could call an api on our backend that may provide info on what to sign and then send the metaTx for the user
undefined says also do we know already when we can expect the new dashboard ?
undefined says you can expect this in late jan-early february or so, the team will update you !
undefined says what are you using for backend ?
undefined says hey,  you might want to double-check the import statements in your code to ensure that the class being extended is imported from the correct location, and that the path to the file is correct.

if the same is correct, pls send your code over
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples/blob/master/nextjs-biconomy-web3Auth/pages/index.tsx @luisal this should help
undefined says hey @rohit_gpta sorry for late response - Yes as such we don't have any rate limiting. But for high txns/second one should contact us as we can offer them the dedicated setupBut currently we support, 180K per Tx/Hr.
undefined says using NestJS, ether.js planning to use the new SDK if possible, create some api endpoints for the front-end to request data to sign and send the signature back. If that is a possible flow with the new SDK.

I don't expect the whole code, but would be nice to know how to build the data to send to the front-end to let user sign, and then how to handle the signedData on the backend to send the MetaTx
undefined says Hmmm
undefined says Tbh, you can go through the SDK guides, we dont have any specific example as of now, all you need to do is create transaction array and pass it to SA package with the provider, if you get stuck in while building this, we are there to help you !
undefined says You release your roadmap these week
undefined says Hey Ravi, Yes, the team will be sharing updates on it on the call. Do join the call tomorrow 
https://discord.gg/pUM8WSF9?event=1062620287415353354
undefined says Thanks for the help. I already checked all biconomy examples and even looked into projects that are using biconomy web3auth package, but it is not enough to solve the errors.
undefined says can you share what errors you are facing ? @luisal
undefined says This is the last one. I dont know what a broke xD or how I brote it 🤪
undefined says can you share me your contract code ?
undefined says Gm
undefined says Happy to be here 🥳
undefined says USDT transfer is available?
undefined says in mainent
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy kindly check your Dm
undefined says Guys, when are you releasing 4337 meta transactions and dashboard??
undefined says Hey @elitex45 we are yet to hear the exact date for it but you may expect in Feb..
undefined says sure
undefined says gm
undefined says Hi, I got some error when do transaction with biconomy? Is it format problem of RPC?
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey guys, I am facing some issues with biconomy gasless transactions.
I have registered factory contract (0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0) and deployProxyByImplementation method for 2 networks (mumbai and goerli).

When I am using mumbai and passing mumbai apiId, apiKey it automatically trying to make transaction to (0x9399bb24dbb5c4b782c70c2969f58716ebbd6a3b - mumbai biconomy relayer address). This is an example https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x7dc6a03044eafae0ea39b65ca938bce0a22d2fe1ea1eae40d1bd978f78646112.

But when I am trying to use goerli and passing goerli apiId, apiKey, signing message with goerli network somehow it trying to call the same mumbai contract (0x9399bb24dbb5c4b782c70c2969f58716ebbd6a3b) withing goerli network. This is an example https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xf0c9b325354e7a2b28cf7cc555ce803ab29ba2b2aa27b8a50541bb4497252958

Can you help me on this or tell me how exactly you defining to what contract call will be made?
undefined says Hey @Karabas this could be because of certain reasons like - configuration and network id, ensure that you have registered the correct factory contract for the network you are trying to use.

Would you mind sharing the code to me ? @Karabas
undefined says when i submit a permit() request of USDC(via https://gasless-meta.prod.biconomy.io/api/v1/native) with the spender being the biconomy forwarder address, who is going to pay for the eth gas ? Note this is not via the forwarder but only a standard USDC Perimt() which I can send directly to the chain which obviously would mean I have to pay the permit() tx gas. But if I want to do it via biconomy, how should it be done and how the gas would be paid ?
undefined says I tried to find the source of SDK PermitClient but can't find it in the latest npm package
undefined says from one of your other example, it seems that I need to do the dai.permit() directly for the initial 'allow forwarder to take dai' but doesn't that beat the purpose of gasless ?
undefined says ok, find the old source(2 years ago) from your repo
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk/blob/erc20Forwarder/src/PermitClient.js
undefined says like 159 clearly shows that it is sent direct
undefined says let tx = await token.permit(
        userAddress,
        spender,
        value,
        parseInt(deadline.toString()),
        v,
        r,
        s
      );
undefined says so the user need to have ETH but what if there is no ETH ? the whole chain doesn't work ?
undefined says Hey @xingxing https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/erc20-metatx-api/example/react-ui/src/App.js
undefined says the user can pay in erc20 tokens, USDC,USDT, DAI
undefined says There are two approach - a trusted forward approach and then paying in erc20 tokens
undefined says yes but the 'initial' permit biconomy to take USDC tx, how does that work ?
undefined says in the trust forward approach, there is a gasToken field which say is USDC. but I have to allow biconomy to spend(via the permit() but that cannot be done without ETH)
undefined says this is in your link
undefined says await getDaiPermit(provider,userAddress,daiPermitOptions);
undefined says this is a direct dail.permit() call to the chain which means the caller pay the gas but  the caller has no ETH then what ?
undefined says also in the forwarder tx, how do I choose whether it is 'we pay'(via our gas tank) and they pay(via USDC which assume some how I find a way to do the permit()) ?
undefined says i have dmed you, please take a look I shared git
undefined says this link is using /api/v2 whereas if I look at the mexa npm package I install, it is using /api/v1/ ? which one is the correct one ? or which one should be used ? The reason I asked is I could be submitting the request via backend(running go) so the javascript npm package is of no use there. I have to directly send it via the rpc endpoint but is confused which one should be used
undefined says another thing is this request https://gasless-meta.prod.biconomy.io/api/v1/systemInfo/?networkId=1 returns minimal info(say no forwarderaddress) but if I use networkId=5, I get the goerli forwarder address as shown on your site. Does it mean I have to do some 'default if not return' if I want to query the 'latest' ? Though given that I have to put forwarder address as part of my contract, it probably don't matter much, i.e. assuming it never changed
undefined says I see that you have  this ERC20Forwarder, https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/blob/master/contracts/6/forwarder/ERC20Forwarder.sol
undefined says is this the one that is listed in your contract address page ? If that is the case, I can manage to use it since you only charge after execution.
undefined says ok, found this but it seems to be not being used for almost 18 months, is this a supported configuration  ? https://etherscan.io/address/0xfaadbe5f0a19f0ebf92aeb73534cbc96b96e2bda
undefined says and it seems that the feeReceiver is at here instead of the forwarder proxy address https://etherscan.io/address/0x30d524adCF4385b5Ef95067a630734886D7Ea6e6
undefined says and it is also not being used for a long time, so I am wondering if this is still supported and how to configure that if it needs to be
undefined says it seems that your dashboard has this option but not sure about address and procedure for using the ERC20Forwarder as I can't even find the address say for goerli(if I want to test it)
undefined says 
undefined says there was an older example here which seems to be for the ERC20Forwarder but again not sure if that approach still works
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/erc20-forwarder-demo/example/react-ui/src/App.js#L212
undefined says mainly that I don't know about the permitAndSendEIP712 signature
undefined says and this tx is scary in terms of cost
undefined says https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3fdd4a3e4d5f2fa7e491eb92736334535df3e813fd039759836e06729910a188/advanced
undefined says the last USDC transfer is the 'fee' according to the contract source and 400 USDC is a lot
undefined says will the session keys be available in biconomys smart contract wallets or do we need to wait until 4337 is deployed by ethereum?
undefined says Hey @hardcrypto we are working on session keys, which means its under development, we will let you know once that is live!
undefined says Hey @xingxing did you check - https://docs.biconomy.io/misc/contract-addresses#biconomy-forwarder-contract-details
undefined says hello all. I heard that soon we would have incentivized nodes programs? or am I mistaken please?
undefined says @aak
undefined says yes those are all trusted forwarder except one on mainnet which has not be used for almost 500 days, I have shown the link
undefined says Yes, do check more about it here 
https://twitter.com/aniket_jindal08/status/1617387564469743617
undefined says hello, I updated SDK in my hobby project a couple of days ago to v1. It worked fine, but today I'm getting 500 errors while trying to connect, url is  https://lrc.admin.openlogin.com/api/v2/user/location. Is it some outage?
undefined says Hey @Vanshika | Biconomy are the Recurring Transactions and Automation Payments SDK modules available? I don't find them in your repo
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy can I DM you?
undefined says Hey @ivanmolto we dont have the recurring transactions and automation payments live in sdk yet !
undefined says although the smart contract wallet approach allows you to have these kind of functionalities
undefined says You can DM me if you have need any help/query to be answered !
@ivanmolto
undefined says Thank you @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy any update about my question of 'user paid' forwarder ?
undefined says After logging into a website with the Biconomy SDK, are there any security guarantees that a user should expect? It seems like after login the site is able to send any transaction on the user's behalf without the user seeing what they are signing?
undefined says Hey @xingxing there is no issues in using this approach - you can use new biconomy sdk for achieving, you can pay gas fees in erc 20 tokens
undefined says which new sdk ? I npm one like a few days ago and can't find anything that is about that
undefined says Hello, here
undefined says I would love to ask a question, how valid is this,
undefined says n00b question - what's the difference between Mexa SDK vs. "new Biconomy SDK"? when to use one vs other?
undefined says I have a question: I found if I do transaction with biconomy, I couldn't find transaction in blockchain browner (for example: https://polygonscan.com/). Where can I find my transaction records?
undefined says I'm trying to use Biconomy social login sdk in my application. I've a doubt, which address will contain my ethers and nfts? SCW address or the EOA address generated after social login?
undefined says Is there any example repo where I can see how to interact with a dapp while using social login sdk of Biconomy?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says Hey @joab , it’s fake. We are not doing any airdrops. Please report and block the account 
Thank you 🙏
undefined says Hello Biconomy dev team, we are in the process of integrating Biconomy into our system and noticed that there is no built-in whitelist system for user addresses. Can you please provide any suggestions or solutions for us to implement a whitelist system in our setup?
undefined says There are plenty of differences here, 
the foremost being that the "new Biconomy SDK" provides a truly decentralized experience (non-custodial in nature)  due to it's smart contract wallet approach. 
In a nutshell, this smart contract wallet that get's deployed for each unique user provides for all sorts of customizations for developers that it offers. And hence becomes a one-stop solution for a seamless web2 like user experience.
These are the facilities you can leverage using the new sdk:
transaction bundling
gasless transactions
paying gas with ERC20 tokens
fiat onramps and offramps
social logins
on the other hand mexa only offers gasless and forward.

All that you can do with mexa, you can already do with the new sdk, but not vice versa.

I'd suggest you to ask your further queries and doubts on our forum (https://forum.biconomy.io/)
undefined says check internal transactions
head to our forum for further queries.
undefined says @xingxing - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/introduction/overview
undefined says SCW address, you can always transfer to EOA as and when required
undefined says SCW is deployed on top of your social login - if a dapp is generating Smart Contract account - your nfts/tokens will be in the counterfactual wallet
undefined says @Deleted User you can check out https://sdk-demo.biconomy.io/bridge - go to connect wallet to see how social login works and the counterfactual wallet address deployed
undefined says what is the npm package ? I need to see the source as I mentioned before we use go and not javasccript. the npm package I get (mesa) doesn't seem to handled the 'pay by token' usage
undefined says Hey @Taiyo not sure what product you are building would like to know more - but we do have conditional whitelisting for mexa sdk - https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/conditional-whitelisting : let me know if this is helpful
undefined says https://www.npmjs.com/package/@biconomy/smart-account
undefined says ??? this one just use the underlying mesa package which I already installed which is what I mentioned, no info fo pay by ERC20 token, there is no contract address for say goerli which means I cannot test if it works. also my outstanding question remains, the code use /v1/ but your latest 'doc' use '/v2', which is the correct backend url link ?
undefined says so currently my two main questions are 1. what are the address for the 'pay by erc20' forwarder on network other than mainnet ? and what rpc endpoint I should use /v1 or /v2 ? the mesa package use /v1 and your doc mentioned /v2
undefined says While running react app after integrating biconomy social login and running using npm start the website is  working fine.... But when we host the build using npm run build the their is an error : Uncaught TypeError: can't convert BigInt to number
I am using  react-app-rewired to handle webpack errors related to lib like crypto etc.

undefined says I am looking at this, https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-paying-gas-in-erc20/using-api there is no networkId param in the post, so how would I specify whether it is mainnet or goerli or any other network ? or the api key is used to distinguish them ?
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Do you have a react native sdk or any reference implementation...
undefined says Hey @Murtaza not for react native as of now but React JS implementation https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/react.js
This one is an example with old mexa sdk - https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk-react-native-example
undefined says what I am getting this ? {\"success\":false,\"message\":\"signature type EIP712Sign is not supported\",\"code\":400}
undefined says I am following your API example
undefined says per your doc curl
undefined says and also tried your 'code' which use slightly different name
undefined says {success: false, message: 'signature type "EIP712_SIGN" is not supported', code: 400}
undefined says so exactly how I can do the API way ?
undefined says ok, it seems that one simply cannot give this option as I search your mesa package where it is never defined(i.e. undefined). I remove the option and it is accepted and I see it in the dashboard but only in progress state and there is not actual on chain tx hash, what do I need to do ?
undefined says ok, thinking it is because there was no ETH in the gas tank, I deposit some and create another tx and now both are sitting there doing nothing. so what else is needed to to ?
undefined says hey, what's wrong?
undefined says 
undefined says anyone help
undefined says @Moderator
undefined says Hello @xingxing our team will review and assist at the earliest. Thanks

undefined says hi, I have integrated sdk in nodejs. getting this error:  ``` {
  code: 'B511',
  message: 'Smart Contract address registered on dashboard is different than what is sent(0x7cccceeb5cff2ea2e07acc13e514c07d75294a6d) in current transaction'
}``` I have checked dashboard. Both addresses are same. @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says meanwhile will check the backend for this - is this is the transaction ? I see them they are on ethereum and then test net goerli one
undefined says are you getting error 417?
undefined says parameter is correct the return doesn't like  the sig type
undefined says this is the one I did directly against the contract(i.e. playing as biconomy backend). it is on goerli. so all my signing etc. are ok. it is your backend that doesn't do anything. it took the request(appeared in the dashboard) but nothing is done
undefined says there are 5 there all saying 'processing'. in fact, each request give me something look like 'tx hash' but I can't find them any where
undefined says Hi, so it seems like you are having Tx Id and not Tx hash- you can find tx hash using biconomy.onevent - meanwhile we will check the status of txns - there is possibility that indexer didnt collect the data and henceforth not showing on dashboard
undefined says no that cannot be the case, as if the tx was sent and went through, the nonce in the forwarder would be increased and it didn't. the only one that work is my direct submimssion(against the forwarder). it was 0 and after all those 5 accepted, it was still 0. only when I submit the tx directly(doing the role of biconomy backend), the nonce changed to 1
undefined says that is why I meant, everything is working contract/data wise, it is how to make the backend at biconomy do the work that is the issue.
undefined says Hello, Why am I getting this error ?  "Error while gas estimation with message cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit  code=UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT

undefined says Hi. We have launched our Agnostic Crypto Payment Gateway for Cross Chain Decentralized Payments for the offline world, built on top of Stargate.Finance. Chains we support are: Polygon, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. We are thinking the possibility to implement a new version with the implementation of gasless transactions and gas fee paid in ERC20 tokens. We are reading your docs in order to figure out the implementation. Can you tell me if this is the correct channel (tech-chat) for developers. In case is not, we appreciate if you can point us to the correct one. Thanks.
undefined says Hey @G.D | Mobydick glad to know this, yes this is the channel for devs, also if you are looking to implement this solution - you can ping me directly and I can get you in loop regarding this
undefined says I made a first read without digging up too much and I have the following thought to share with you. Paying gas with ERC20 tokens have the disadvantage  because we manage tokens to pay purchases that are not supported by Biconomy, so will have the same problem (before they have no gas and then they have no gas ERC20 tokens). Sometimes it will match and sometimes not our pay token and your supported ERC20 token to pay gas. (thinking in loud voice, may be when not matching let them choose a second token to pay gas supported by Biconomy). On the other side we have the gasless transactions. We were thinking that we can use this method with the particularity that before sending the transaction we get feeQuotes from you in order we can attach to the pay token the amount needed to refund us that gas so we can add in our contract function a swap and transfer to our gas tank in order to refund us the gas used. We can also make a mix of both methods regarding the circumstances. What do you think regarding your experience. Am I in the correct understanding?
undefined says Hey @G.D | Mobydick Super interesting, if I am getting this correctly, so is the idea that you want to mix the aspect of paying gas in tokens as well as utilising gasless for when they dont have gas or we dont support that erc20?

Can you give a bit more colour and context on the dapp and what the transaction journey would look like?
undefined says Actually our dapp makes a quotation of the amount of input token and cross chain message fee in native gas on source chain needed to get exact output token on destination chain to pay their purchases. Then we send the transaction to our router on source chain which is in charge of swaps and cross. Cases in which input token or balance in another token matches Biconomy ERC20 token to pay for gas would be added to our transaction to be sent to your relayer. But in case there is no match we should quote how much of input token to add to the transaction to send to your relayer and use our gas tank to pay for the transaction. Our router then will swap the excess of input token into native gas in order to refund our gas tank.
undefined says Hello everyone! I am exploring the use of ERC-4337 for a new feature in my dapp, where users can nominate inheritors for their assets stored in their wallets. The app would require some verification upon the user's passing before transferring the assets to the inheritors. I am curious to know if this is a feasible solution using ERC-4337, and would appreciate any insights or guidance you may have and I'd love to integrate biconomy in some way, so any sort of help would be highly appreciated!
undefined says Can you tell me which mainnet networks are supported for Smart Accounts??
undefined says Here it is @Vanshika | Biconomy 
https://github.com/Qudusayo/gasless-transactions-example
undefined says Got it, great flow, let me know if you need any help technically, or if you have any confusions 🙌🏻
undefined says So you are trying to use account abstraction (4337) + **conditional whitelisting** right ? 
This doc maybe helpful - https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/conditional-whitelisting
undefined says Hope this helps @suhelkap.eth if u have any more doubts - feel free to ask
undefined says Hi @G.D | Mobydick as of now, we are live on 7 testnets, we are yet to do mainnet launches on ethereum and polygon - so you can build and test it out on these 7 networks - 1. Goerli2. Mumbai3. BSC Testnet4. Avalanche Testnet C-Chain5. Optimism Testnet6. Arbitrum Testnet7. Moonbeam Testnet
undefined says I am looking for examples and docs about "session keys". I am mostly looking to implement recurring payments. Session keys are referred to in this video https://youtu.be/NBQEtLjN84E and github https://github.com/bcnmy/scw-contracts/tree/session-module/contracts
undefined says Hi, we don't have any specific examples about sessions keys, for the new sdk - the sessions keys are yet to be released
undefined says Hi there, we were able to relay/deploy a contract to Polygon Mumbai Testnet. But subsequent events of the contracts are not getting recorded under this contract.  We executed a function (that was registered in Biconomy dashboard) of this contract, but the transaction was not recorded. The transactions are being sent successfully, but no evidence is seen in Explorer/PolygonScan. Below are the contact addresses & txhash details. Appreciate your support to resolve this

Deployer Contract - 0x538DEa0860Bea39b66c95eBcab3cfF70e4432A73 
Actual Contract - 0x4065ccf564cFA83396a69a6Af73111967713a70E
Tx hash - 0x632184a419d4ccc3a0f6425dea16e006183536bb6abd445e2ec4f1a1ac162a27, confirms the function was successfully executed
undefined says Does the session keys feature rely on metamask snaps being released?
undefined says Hi! would it be possible to whitelist certain wallet addresses to pay gas fees or not? 
so for instance, 0x1234 must pay gas fees and 0x2456 doesn't need.
undefined says I did all this and I'm still getting an error: 
```

The other polyfills are fine but for some reason fs hits.

undefined says Any help with this @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says c.c @Rahat | Biconomy
undefined says @Qudusayo | WeaveDB Hi apologies, couldnt answer this earlier - so as per what I can see on your github repo - https://github.com/Qudusayo/gasless-transactions-example/blob/main/pages/index.js

In your index.js file the greeter address is  `greeterAddress = "0x671C54C8a0b354eD7e0B0424114D4B1FB7512AcC" `

but your smart contract address happens to be this - 0x19dfbcc38aa618043ca36daa2e052aabeafdbe29 

Kindly update that in your index.js and then run from dashboard, this should work
undefined says Also @Qudusayo | WeaveDB feel free to let us know - what exactly you would like to cover up if we created onboarding/explanation to basic modules
undefined says Sorry I didn't update that earlier. 
Just pushed the changes now and to see what I've been trying so far
undefined says Majorly Gasless Transactions
undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy , I am working with @Sreeni on the project. Well the transactions are being successfully sent, which is why we are getting the txnHash. But if we try to look up the our used smart contract on PolygonScan, we don't see any transaction that shows a transaction is made on the chain.
undefined says Thanks, but this is based on a contract address. Seems like it can't filter by wallet address yet?
undefined says Tried this as well does not work
undefined says Are you launching in the short term on the following mainnet networks: Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Optimism ?
undefined says Just want some clarification: in case users pay gas with ERC20 supported tokens, there is no need that users first fund the Smart Account. I understand that the funding occurs when smartAccount.createRefundTransaction() is triggered before the transaction itself. If the transaction uses less gas than quoted, user is refunded in the Smart Account or in his EOA? On my side, when my contract function is called, I understand msg.sender will be the Smart Account.
undefined says I will check this @navyansh007
undefined says right now are live on testnets, team will update on this
undefined says Hi @G.D | Mobydick 

If users pay gas with ERC20 supported tokens, there is no need for them to fund the smart account with ether. Instead, the smart account will use the ERC20 tokens as payment for the gas fees.When smartAccount.createRefundTransaction() is called, it estimates the gas required for the transaction, and then transfers that amount of ERC20 tokens from the user's wallet to the smart account. This is done before the actual transaction is sent to the network.
undefined says Also - If the actual gas cost of the transaction is less than the estimated gas cost, the remaining tokens are refunded back to the user's wallet, which would be SCW and not the EOA as the entire function uses smart account - but you can transfer those funds to EOA separately later
undefined says Hey guys! Anyone knows why am I getting this error: ``Could not find read method 'trustedForwarder' in the contract abi`` ?
I am importing both ```import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@opengsn/contracts/src/ERC2771Recipient.sol";
``` in my code (updating the contract with *_msgSender()* and overriding the functions appearing in both contracts). Shouldn't it be automatically set the *trustedForwarder* method or should I implement something more? Happening to me when trying to create relayed transactions.
undefined says also, is it possible to schedule a meeting with the Biconomy team to try solve the technical issue? Thanks!
undefined says Hi @KuchlerHelmut you should check out this repo - https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/metatx/ERC2771Context.sol
undefined says also you might want to read this out - https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771#use-_msgsender-not-msg.sender
undefined says If you have more doubts, you can share code with me on DM @kumbag
undefined says You can DM me, whatever issues you are going through - we can try taking it up here and if not solve-able, we can take out a solution
undefined says OMG Musk's reward for crypto community
undefined says I was seeing that message too but ultimately it didn't matter. i.e. your problem might lie elsewhere
undefined says oh and what did you fix so it disappeared ?
undefined says I think my client code was incorrect. 2 secs i'll check what I do now
undefined says thanks!
undefined says already doing it and importing the gsn contract also
undefined says I used the biconomy SDK and ethers

Basically, 

1) instantiate your contract and pass biconomy.ethersProvider as the 3rd/last argument
2) populate transaction
3) call biconomy.provider.send with the tx data
4) optionally - wait on the tx hash being generated and do something
undefined says If you want to share pseudocode I don't mind having a look. (I don't work for biconomy btw)
undefined says I use EIP712_SIGN and it looks like this on our site: https://www.tiktok.com/@hodlmymoon/video/7197838552665836805
undefined says Thank you so much!
undefined says This is probably closest to what I do: https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/sdk-3
undefined says 
undefined says thank you! I will look at it now
undefined says @steve_hodlmymoon.com  just sent you a DM
undefined says Hello, just seen that I cannot use HDWalletProvider for meta transactions. What alternative is out there if I do not want to interact with external wallets such as Metamask? I would like to interact with my one private key and address, not external tools. Thanks!
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy the contract is getting updated with the desired outcomes. The problem is  the transactions are not visible in the original contract, except contract creation.
undefined says Hey devs, I wanted to do deploy a smart contract using bichonomy gasless transaction.
I am building the tx object but it needs a "to" field.
undefined says I wanted to know if this is possible through bichonomy.
I am making this work with ethersJS contract factory but facing issues with bichonomy so wanted to know. Any help would be really appreciated.
undefined says Would your "to field" not just be your factory contract? And that factory contract would have a function to create a new instance of the implementation contract?
undefined says I.e. the meta tx is user -> factory contract
undefined says And you could use _msgSender() in the factory contract to get the actual users address to pass to the implementation contract.
undefined says Just ideas. I've not done this myself yet
undefined says Thanks for the explanation.
Let me be more precise on my end.
So I have the contract bytecode and I want to deploy a new contract with this bytecode.
Now I want this deployment transaction to be gasless.
So I created a tx object etc.
And since there is no "to" field as the contract is yet to be deployed, I added the "to" field to the tx object using `getCreate2Address`.
Now once I send the transaction, no contract is created.
undefined says What happens if you leave "to" unspecified?
undefined says @protagonist
undefined says So if I do this, it throws an error -
undefined says Sorry, I'm not familiar with the account abstraction stuff. I'd probably dig into those files ^ though to see if there's any clues you can gather.

If you can't get things working the way you'd like; the factory contract method would probably work. (I was thinking of doing that myself)
undefined says I have used the factory contract method itself to built the transaction and was just using `sendGaslessTransaction`  to send the transaction.
undefined says Not sure why it fails at this step.
undefined says Thanks for helping out.
Would really appreciate any help @Rahat | Biconomy  / @Syed Zelani Biconomy OG
undefined says you can create your own wallet object using ether.js or web3js
undefined says Hello, sure, please allow sometime, our team will review and assist shortly. 

CC: @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says Thanks a lot.
undefined says Hi @protagonist i hope you have meta transaction enabled contract right ?
undefined says But this is contract deployment right ?
Meta transactions should be enabled for interaction with the contract functions correct ?
undefined says So I am suggesting the possible reasons - check for sufficient gas and check if the contract code has already been deployed to the address returned by the getCreate2Address method, then the transaction will fail.
undefined says yes
undefined says is it possible for you to share the code and which version of mexa you are using ? @protagonist
undefined says Thank you so much for your help around this.
- Gas is sufficient.
- I have exactly logged out the getCreate2Address() with different salts and no contract has been deployed on those addresses.
- I also added these addresses as "to" fields but it does not work.
- As per ethereum docs, for contract deployment, the "to" address should be zero, so I even tried with zero address and it does not work.

I have this running with ethersJS and there I do not need to add anything as the "to" address.
undefined says check with putting null instead of 0
undefined says The issue is in bichonomy validation when I call sendGaslessTransaction
undefined says I tried create2 address, zero address and null.
undefined says I am sharing this, see if this helps : 
Construct a transaction object with the following fields:
to: Set to null, as the contract has not yet been deployed.
data: Set to the bytecode of the contract you want to deploy.
gasPrice: Set to 0, as you want the transaction to be gasless.
gas: Set to the gas limit that you want to use for the transaction.
nonce: Set to the next nonce for the sender's address.
value: Set to 0, as you don't want to send any ether with the transaction.
undefined says can you send me the code you are implementing in my DM ?
undefined says Sure. Thanks.
undefined says will check it on my end also for biconomy validation
undefined says Hey I am not able to DM.
undefined says Can you please check the same. @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says done @protagonist
undefined says Hi,  the reason for this is that Relayer calls Trusted Forwarder and Trusted Forwarder calls their contract so it is an internal transaction.And polygon scan does not show the contract's transactions if those are internal. But they can check in transaction hash's logs that their contract gets called.
https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x632184a419d4ccc3a0f6425dea16e006183536bb6abd445e2ec4f1a1ac162a27#eventlog
undefined says hope this helps @Sreeni @navyansh007
undefined says Any help so far @Vanshika | Biconomy  ??
undefined says hey guys, I am getting the following error :
``{
  code: 'B511',
  message: 'No smart contract wallet or smart contract registered on dashboard with address (0xe08588168cba6188a1d34f8ac7xxxxxxxxxxxf5)'

``
My dashboard does have the correct contract and methods registered with the above mentioned address, what may be causing that?
undefined says Hi @Qudusayo | WeaveDB what help do you need, I already suggested the changes for your contract is there anything i am missing out on?
undefined says hey @kumbag which provider are you using ?
undefined says I changed everything already and I updated the repo, but looks like you missed it out
undefined says are you facing any more issues?
undefined says tried both alchemy and infura, not any external wallet such as metamask
undefined says No, but I've not been able to process the transaction successfully
undefined says 🤷🏽‍♂️
undefined says 
undefined says Hi, has anyone faced this error ```Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/native' from origin 'http://localhost:3000/' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.``` ?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy 
Is signing a signature request still possible using biconomy social login (gmail, facebook)? how does it work? 
If user logs in via metamask, coinbase, etc then it'd popup within the provider but would that also work with social logins?
undefined says @Aditya | Biconomy @Ahmed Al-Balaghi 
hi!! Can I dm someone from biconomy tech team?? I'd like to ask about the specific usecase of AA with Biconomy SDK for our project.
undefined says @enmai Hi, feel free to DM me regarding this - happy to chat
undefined says Thank you!!
undefined says ok
undefined says @Vanshika | BiconomyHi. We are near to build with EIP 2771 approach to enable gassless transactions. As we want to manage the refund ourselves via any token, I would like to know if there is any markup over gas consumed by your relayer to make our maths.
undefined says Hey @G.D | Mobydick glad to know this , it would be 8-12% of total gas fee paid by user in the tx
undefined says Hi all, I am also seeing the issue that @DSur2k17 reported on 2nd Feb:

`The method eth_signTypedData_v4 does not exist/is not available``

I have just started out with Biconomy and am testing with an ethers wallet and an infura provider on node.
undefined says I feel like the reason for the error must have something to do with the fact that I am using ethers on node, rather than testing in a browser. I am initialising biconomy like this, which I feel can't be right.

```
// hack needed because Biconomy requires passing in a web3 provider,
            // in the form of an Ethers external provider.
            // even if we have a normal Ethers one.
            const web3provider: providers.ExternalProvider = {
                request: (request: { method: string, params?: Array<any> }) =>                               (wallet.provider as providers.JsonRpcProvider)
                        .send(request.method, request.params || []);
                }
            }

            const biconomy = new Biconomy(web3provider, {
                apiKey: config.apiKey,
                debug: true,
                contractAddresses: [config.contractAddress],
            });```

undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy Hi Vanshika, can you please verify whether signing a signature request is possible with biconomy social logins?
undefined says Hi @Sejong When using social logins the user does not need to sign. The signer object handles that.Signature request signing is possible when using Metamask
undefined says @Qudusayo | WeaveDB Did you make any progress with it?
undefined says Hey @Vanshika | Biconomy  I sent you a DM. Thanks!
undefined says Nope, I haven’t

@Devesh^F
undefined says Ok thanks,  I've been using `@biconomy/mexa` for gasless with meta-tx and recently found out the new `@biconomy/smart-account`. 
Seems like this new SDK is not ready for mainnet, it's super confusing since it's the official doc on your page 😦 and I assume mexa is still the only way to go gasless on mainnet.

Several Qs:
1. Is the old mexa dashboard going to be maintained after the smart account dashboard launch?
2. can you please confirm if web3auth social login is feasible with mexa's EIP712 gasless solution? (or with smart-account)
undefined says Hey, I am new to biconomy and I have some fundamental level doubts to it, so if someone could help me with them
undefined says Does Biconomy use Web3Auth underneath for social login functionality
undefined says Just curious
undefined says Hi @Sejong so the mexa sdk is live on these networks, while the new biconomy sdk which implements smart contract wallet and accounts using account abstraction is yet to go live

This is for the mexa sdk -  https://docs.biconomy.io/misc/supported-networks 
For new biconomy sdk - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/networks-supported
undefined says Yes, just for social login - we use web3auth for login, while biconomy sdk allows to spin a smart contract account on top of the login you have made
undefined says Cool cool
undefined says has anyone tried using biconomy mexa sdk with react-native??
been getting this error

undefined says Hey all so my gasless API transaction signature is a bit complicated. My provider in my frontend can't even estimate the gas. So can I ask the team to add a bypass parameter OR "reckless" parameter so the backend can run the request without the gas estimation? This is REALLY the last thing I need, everything works in prod but this. 

For endpoint: https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/native

This is my impl, the tx works without gasless, business logic is correct, the issue is that I hardcode the gasLimit on the frontend, and on the backend it tries to execute estimateGas and throws a 417:
undefined says Hi.
undefined says Is there any way to use the sdk with local smartContracts like in hardhat?
undefined says Hi there! 

I'm Tony, a core dev in a few games in Decentraland. We want to integrate cross-chain payments as Decentraland has. 
So we need the same functionality—the ability to sign a transaction on the mainnet and relay it to the polygon network. 
Can someone assist me with that case?
undefined says wen pawswap list
undefined says Hi yes, you can use both hardhat and truffle env with sdk
undefined says @TonyMo Hi Tony, feel free to DM me about this, can connect you with internal team for guidance and assistance-happy to help
undefined says Hi @nNON you might want to check out this forum post for 417 error, let me know if error persists - https://forum.biconomy.io/t/417-error-while-setting-up-mexa-sdk/124
undefined says I've sent the request. Confirm please
undefined says Hi
undefined says any admin here ?
undefined says Hi Biconomy, is anyone able to have a look at this issue I am having with @biconomy/mexa?  https://discord.com/channels/692403655474937856/692404159982338059/1080091174888554506

In addition, I have a question about ERC2771 support. Does Biconomy support sending concurrent transactions from the same wallet? Ie. if I send transaction 2 before transaction 1 has been confirmed, will it fail due to nonce clashes on the trusted forwarder contract? If so, does Biconomy support us specifying our own trusted forwarder contract?
undefined says Are gas fees for ERC-4337 expected to be higher than EOAs, like it is now?
undefined says Hey @Manav | Biconomy can you look into this issue?

On your second question - yes, we support this, as we have autoscaling mechanisms in place in our relayers, and also support 2D nonces
undefined says @mackiemesser for 2D nonces, here's some context-

Search 'Batched Transactions / 2D Nonces' on this page
https://medium.com/biconomy/moving-forward-save-your-eth-pay-gas-in-erc20-tokens-7fcd9969d9ff

You can make use of 2D nonces (send those with different batchId) and not worry about ordering or signature mismatch issue.
To sequence batchIds you can do an incremental order indefinitely. batchnonce will be queried from the contract for the user and batchId. Purpose here is for parallel transaction for same signer. 

BatchId should be different for same signer. If it was for different users or not parallel txns then batchId can always be 0 and 1D nonce will work.
You can pass batchId as additional param in transaction the way we send gasLimit
undefined says Great - thanks @Rhic | Biconomy , I 'll take a look
undefined says Yes, there is some overhead, but with txn batching, you can reduce overhead as well
undefined says Hi, @mackiemesser apologies for late reply. The error message you're seeing may be related to the fact that eth_signTypedData_v4 is not part of the Ethereum JSON-RPC API. This method is specific to the Metamask browser extension, and is not available in other Ethereum clients or environments, such as Ethers on NodeJS.In order to use eth_signTypedData_v4 with Biconomy, you may need to use a web3 provider that supports this method. Alternatively, you can use a different signing method, such as eth_sign, which is available in most Ethereum clients.(https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html#signtypeddata-v4)
undefined says Let me know once you have changed how you are signing the date and if you still face any issue @mackiemesser
undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy  ours is a backend implementation. I have an ethers wallet (which does support signTypedData). How do I pass that to a biconomy instance?
undefined says Is biconomy a bundler for ERC-4337 transactions? and are bundlers different to block builders?
undefined says I see then you can check out this -  https://github.com/bcnmy/gasless-playground/blob/master/src/components/Ethers_Custom_EIP712Sign.tsx

if you face any issues let me know
undefined says Isn't there any other robust solution. Rather than overriding configs using react-app-rewired ? @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says for the polyfill issue?
undefined says Yes
undefined says hello. i would like to understand how can i use biconomy sdk into a new app with react and be able to implement the use of smart accounts
undefined says your documentation website is obscure, it doesnt shows a good guide that answer my questions. that is why i am here
undefined says i would like to start with one question:

by using biconomy sdk would i be able to offer to users to access to existing smart accounts and create new smart accounts?
undefined says Hey @Leinier , sorry to hear that our docs didn't proved helpful for you. But just in case you missed it we have some quick-start guides with react right here: https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/guides/react.js

Answering your question, the sdk has been developed to abstract all the blockchain complexities away from the users and provide them a more intuitive web2 like experience far from the worries of creating and maintaining a wallet and the heed to pay gas at every single transaction. This is being delivered through something known as Smart-Contract-Wallets (SCWs) which allows the developers to make custom transaction flow and also to do batching of transactions. Also users can perform batched transactions gaslessly too. 
Smart Accounts are nothing but an alias used for SCWs.
New Smart Accounts are created when a new user onboards your dApp without them even knowing it! 
I hope this clarifies stuff a little. 

Also you can refer to this tutorial by Nader for proper technical understanding:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBPoVs66CxE
undefined says thank you. i will check that out
undefined says i understood everything on that video. yet i have other questions. how to implement a new logic/flow in order to set automatic payment from a smart account?
undefined says i dont see that on the biconomy doc website
undefined says i want to learn how to create new flow/logic to attach to a smart account in order to execute X action, i.e.: automatic payment, or automatic execution of a function in a random smart contract...
undefined says is that possible with biconomy sdk?
undefined says another question. does biconomy offer the possibility to associate a passkey to a smart account instead of using a social login?
undefined says i am thinking about the possibility to offer to the user the possibility to create a smart account using a passkey from her/his smartphone or a usb security device
undefined says hello
undefined says I only can deploy smart contract wallet using  public Dapp Api key from docs : https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/sending-transactions/gasless-transactions , Dapp Api Key from dashboard is not working
undefined says I see this "Feel free to get in touch with us for spinning up personal test keys and gas tanks on other test networks. ", How I can get my personal Key
undefined says P/s : I am working on a project building a account abstraction mobile wallet using Biconomy SDK
undefined says Hi everyone I am pretty new to biconomy (and to the web3 stuff as well) and was wondering about the following two questions: 1) Can I add unlimited smart contracts to my dAPP via API (since my app has a contract factory) (also add limiting conditions) 2) Can I use magic connect in order to sign the transactions that interact with the paymaster? 3) Is the way to limit abuse of the paymaster to add rules to only allow access if you own a specific token? This token could be dropped to your wallet upon successful app registration.  

I am really interested in finding a solution to not let our users pay the gas of the transaction but I having trouble seeing through the docs.
undefined says Hi everyone.
I created Smart Account Contract with @biconomy-sdk. but It was normal Smart Contract. How can I deploy Smart Account Contract by proxy contract?
undefined says Hello guys,
Can you please let me know how to use session key in biconomy sdk?
undefined says Hello everyone , can someone tell me how can i implement biconomy on a script
undefined says Yes, that is because the dashboard is compatible with mexa-sdk which is our legacy product. It uses singleton gas tanks unlike the flow the new smart-account sdk now follows. The new smart-account sdk follows the SCW flow that uses a paymaster for every onboarding user but it's live only on specified test-nets yet. In-order to use the new sdk flow on mainnet or other testnets, kindly use the keys provided on the docs or request for one on your preferred network, if key is not provided. This is to be done only till the dashboard for the new sdk goes live, which will be soon. 

Tl;dr : The keys from the legacy dashboard will only work with dapps build on mexa-sdk and not on the new-sdk.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey @Deleted User 
It's WIP rn
undefined says Hi all, is there any possibility to export the private key?
undefined says Found it : https://github.com/bcnmy/biconomy-client-sdk/pull/95/commits/badd18a710e0b9d7ae8ade9b4007717e9a9330de#diff-b57067b133035b46296cbb8f29c27b01d16c81ae0a9cb9f966dc986651dd9959 thanks team !

undefined says Hi there.
undefined says I want to transfer my NFTs from my BSC wallet to another backup wallet using relayer method. Is there anybody can help me that how to set the perimeters?
1 source wallet
2 destination wallet
3 gassfee paying wallet (Gastank)
Where do I need to put all those perimeters...? 
Kindly help me out.
undefined says Is there anybody can help me understand that?

undefined says Hey @CRYPTUDENT 
didn't exactly got your concern, what do you mean by relayer method?
Do you want to transfer NFTs gaslessly from BSC to another wallet?
undefined says Yes because i don't have the gas fee in source wallet.
undefined says I'm a victim of sweep bot but have a few remaining assets left as trapped.
undefined says Staked assets are also trapped but for now my concern is to Rescue the remaining NFTs in victim wallet.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hi @Tano thanks for your question and apologies for the delay on this one, I was occupied with some external conference related work

First thing first, if you want to integrate biconomy in your dapp, then feel free to DM me your TG id, i could probably help you with integrations on better level, secondly about the condition you mentioned - seems like you want to whitelist wallets on certain defined conditions, if yes then this might be helpful to you - https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/conditional-whitelisting
undefined says Hi @Deleted User the session key feature is yet to go live, you will hear about it soon
undefined says Hello everyone, I am customizing the Biconomy SDK for mobile. I am using the Signer from ethers this.wallet = new ethers.Wallet(private_key,provider) and customized the signTypedData function as follows: return await this.wallet._signTypedData(domain, types, message). However, when I sendRequest with the eth_sendSmartContractWalletTransaction method, I encounter a 400 error. Can you check to see which step I might be doing wrong?
undefined says Hi @Enetty can you share your code here?
undefined says Hey guys so I’m using the biconomy sdk to send meta transaction using the custom implementation, how can I send ether along a meta transaction
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-demo this issue happen in demo sdk when use  `User pays for wallet deployment cost` option.
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says Hi everyone!

I'm currently working on developing an election DApp that will have two types of users: voters and election creators. I want to include gasless transactions in this DApp, but I also want to make it so that the election creators can sponsor the gas cost for the voters, instead of me as the deployer and contract owner sponsoring it.

I'm hoping to get some help on how to achieve this. If you have any suggestions or ideas, I would really appreciate it! Thank you in advance.
undefined says I have three contracts ,staking NFT, miniting nft collection and mint token. I want to make NFT staking gasless. For that I have made the required changes in staking contract to make it Biconomy compliant. 

When integrating in frontend like this

```
useEffect(() => {
    const initBiconomy = async () => {

      biconomy = new Biconomy((signer?.provider ).provider, {
        apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
        debug: true,
        contractAddresses: "0xB3f2C9aFa71B3E3167f67e4295439A26E9F6747C",
      });
      await biconomy.init();
    };
    if ( address,signer?.provider) initBiconomy();
  }, [ address, signer?.provider]);
  const stakeNft = async () => {
    try {
        const provider = await biconomy.provider;
        const contractInstance = new ethers.Contract(
        StakingAbi.address,
        StakingAbi.abi,
        biconomy.ethersProvider
      );
      let { data } = await contractInstance.populateTransaction.stakeNFT(nft.tokenID);
      let txParams = {
        data: data,
        to: "0xB3f2C9aFa71B3E3167f67e4295439A26E9F6747C",
        from: "0x4FbFa4D2F726B930FeE542049F62065A94763966",
        signatureType: "EIP712_SIGN",
        gasLimit: 5000000,
      };
      const approve = await nftContract?.isApprovedForAll(
        address,
        StakingAbi.address
      );
      console.log(approve);
      if (!approve) {
        const tx1 = await nftContract?.setApprovalForAll(
          StakingAbi.address,
          true
        );
      }
      setTimeout(async () => {
              console.log("txParams", txParams);

      const tx = await provider.send("eth_sendTransaction", [txParams]);
        console.log(tx);
            biconomy.on("txHashGenerated", (data) => {
        console.log(data);
      });
        window.alert("NFT Stake Successful");
      }, 2000);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  };
```
I'm getting these error
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy, @Manav | Biconomy, Can you help me?
undefined says Active project? I don't receive any support.
undefined says okay thanks for providing this - looking into it @Enetty
undefined says Hi @Enetty this could be possible because of the  incorrect input parameters being passed to the eth_sendSmartContractWalletTransaction method. Double-check that you are passing the correct values for the to, data, and value parameters.
undefined says i see the value and other params mentioned just 0
undefined says Hi, it would be nice to understand the logic - I'm guessing, you are having two parties and you want whitelist the contract for election creators so that can sponsor the gas fees ?

you can check this - https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/build-with-biconomy-sdk/gasless-transactions @Aditya let me know if you have any more questions
undefined says Are you using trustedforwarder approach anywhere  ? @I also which chain and which sdk version is it?
undefined says @I ping with your contract and script on DM - or maybe send a github link
undefined says Essentially, I'm creating a DApp that allows anyone to run elections on the blockchain. I want to give the creators of each election the option to fund the transactions of the voters who participate in their specific election.

I was considering deploying a new contract for every election, but I'm wondering if there's a way to allow them to fund the contract directly from the frontend to enable gasless transactions.
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy currently to implement this, I am planning add an opt-in feature on the create election modal, where the organizer can choose to sponsor the transactions. If they opt in, we will deploy the election contract which inherits from ERC2771Context. If they opt out, we will deploy the normal contract. The relevant function inside my contract can be modified as shown below:
```function getElection(Election.ElectionInfo memory _electionInfo, uint _ballotType, uint _resultCalculatorType, address _electionOrganizer, address _electionOrganizerContract) external onlyOrganizerContract returns(Election) {
        Election election;
        ballot=getBallot(_ballotType);
        resultCalculator=getResultCalculator(_ballotType, _resultCalculatorType);
                if(_electionInfo.gasless==true){
                        election = new ElectionGasless(_electionInfo,ballot,resultCalculator,_electionOrganizer,_electionOrganizerContract);
                } else {
                      election = new Election(_electionInfo,ballot,resultCalculator,_electionOrganizer,_electionOrganizerContract);     
                }
                return election;
    }
```
If the organizer chooses to opt-in for gasless transactions, I will redirect them to a new page with instructions on how to configure the smart contract for gasless transections on Biconomy dashboard, and from there they will have to manually configure their specific contract on Biconomy Dashboard,  Do you happen to know if there's a better alternative?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy  Biconomy sdk has hooks such as wagmi or web3React?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy I just added Binance Smart Chain test in the config, and didn't modify anything in the source code. Does it mean the demo has passed wrong params from the beginning?
undefined says Can I DM to you?
undefined says Sending native asset (ETH, matic) is a restriction of the meta transaction framework so can't be done via mexa SDK but can be done with the new SDK via Smart contract wallets only
undefined says Thanks Manav and is there a doc I can use to implement?
undefined says You can externally import them for now
undefined says yes sure @Enetty
undefined says Hello Y'all
I'm new here
undefined says Please check inbox
undefined says Hello !
undefined says https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/sdk-reference/sending-transactions/user-pay-gas-in-erc20-tokens/sending-erc-20-tokens hope this helps @2’4
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy is StarkNet integration planned in foreseeable future?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy With the new Biconomy SDK, does the contract need to inherit meta transaction? or can it still go gasless without it
undefined says It still goes gasless without it ser
undefined says You'll just need to deposit funds in the paymaster if opting for gasless through the dashboard, which will go live soon for the mainnet
undefined says As of now, there is nothing mentioned by team, if there are any such updates, we will let you all know
undefined says This @Deleted User guy from support? He's contacting in DM.
undefined says Thanks. @Manav | Biconomy is the paymaster one universal contract? or is it going to be deployed per dapp?
undefined says Yes she’s an admin @CRYPTUDENT
undefined says I think that's not true.
undefined says And who're you...?
undefined says It was a coordinated scam attempt.
undefined says @Deleted User
undefined says Weren't you offering me a bot?
undefined says I just need to understand how to use Biconomy for gasless transaction to avoid the sweep bot.
undefined says I don't need any bot in DM.
undefined says @Manav | Biconomy sir I would like to ask whether should i buy the bot from the guy I'm talking with?
undefined says No
undefined says I just need to verify. That's my right.
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says When i try to contact her her DMSs aren't even opened.
undefined says So stop wasting your time, trying to scam me.
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy Can I DM you for some guidance?
undefined says hii
undefined says :BICO:
undefined says It's going to be deployed per dApp
undefined says Certainly not, we don't offer any such bot services as of now and no-one from the team would approach you in such a fashion. 
Pls refrain
undefined says Is that because it needs to whitelist contract address? 
Am I correct that biconomy's paymaster contract can block contract address other than the one you added on the dashboard?
undefined says Hi, I minted a NFT position in hypen and staked it. Would i be getting just staking rewards or both staking rewards an pool APY ?
undefined says Also Is there any pool with sufficient liquidity to swap bico token on polygon ? Could not find any on uni or sushi
undefined says @Manav | Biconomy @Vanshika | Biconomy , Could you please help with above queries ?
undefined says Sure @sejuti01
undefined says Hi @0xOnchain let me check this with team
undefined says Hello, do you have an estimated date for the release of the new sdk on mainnets ?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy , Do you have any updates ?
undefined says should be in a couple of months ser
undefined says Hey @Sejong 
The purpose of the paymaster is to subsidise transaction for users per dApp. 
It essentially acts as a gas tank. 
No such logic functions are entertained by the paymaster.
You can learn further here : https://biconomy.gitbook.io/sdk/contracts/wallet-contracts/account-abstraction-contracts/paymaster-contract
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hi 
can anyone tell why  making payment through biconomy giving this error ?
undefined says Hello, this call is returning timeouts:

undefined says Sorry for the inconvenience, I have raised the issue to Technical team, they should be reaching out shortly. Thanks
undefined says apparently i got a 200 now, is it fixed permanently?
undefined says 😄
undefined says thanks guys!
undefined says hi @mhamzza it says unexpected token < , can you check if you are formatting the request correctly?
undefined says Hi @weepmac @ [5TARS.io] is it working now ?
undefined says there was some issue on biconomy end 
its working fine nwo
undefined says apparently yes Vanishka, it was just caused by timeouts, did you find the issue?
undefined says its usually on api status side, if its working all should be good!
undefined says good day, please is it possible to implement gasless transactions without a dapp using biconomy?
undefined says I want users to be able to interact with my contract on etherscan without paying gasfees
undefined says If yes please explain or point me to a documentation or article
undefined says @Rahat | Biconomy @Syed Zelani Biconomy OG @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says Hey yes! you can set this up on your contract - you would fund a gas tank that would cover the cost for the users - here is more info form our docs: 

https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions#how-do-gasless-transactions-work
undefined says We are looking to have a singleton paymaster to make it easier and cheaper for dapps
undefined says Yes. But.  This approach will not fit all business cases.
undefined says Sorry?
undefined says I makes Biconomy  bundlers not compatible with EIP 4337
undefined says Why not allow bunplers to process all arbitrary requests following 4337 and being paid for that ?
undefined says @Ahmed Al-Balaghi
undefined says this should help @Nonso if you have anymore questions feel free to ask
undefined says Thank you @Vanshika | Biconomy !
I described my project case at this diagram
The question is.
Is it or will be possible to integrate with Biconomy bundlers according to his scheme ?
@Nonso 
Thank you in advance.
undefined says hey team have questions, social login is only facebook and email? can it have twitter, reddit etc? can i see live example of social login
undefined says hey, yes as of now we integrated fb, email and gmail, the others arent possible
undefined says If you want to see a live example of social login with SCW implementation , you can test out - https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/bicoauth-demo @kingofreddit13
undefined says Do you want to just have bundlers ? @Bogdan @Nonso also can we connect on DM - please share your telegram ID so that i can help you with all team efforts
undefined says no live projects?
undefined says https://sdk-demo.biconomy.io/bridge
undefined says got it!
undefined says We're actively building bundlers within the SDK
undefined says ```let smartAccount = new SmartAccount(provider, options);```
can the provider here be a provider from ethers.js rather than web3auth?
undefined says correct you can grab a provider from ethers js as well - it just needs a provider the example with web3auth is to enable social login
undefined says Thanks😃
undefined says yo
undefined says gm gm!
undefined says gm! I played around with the newes Biconomy SDK and just wonder if there is still a method to send gasless metatransactions without using the smart wallet? Everything I can see in the new docs is examples using smart wallet, with or without social login. Could anyone tell me more about? 👀
undefined says Hi @creazy.eth https://docs.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless you can go though this doc although we would recommend you to give a try to new biconomy SDK as well !
undefined says let me know if you have any questions
undefined says hey I've encountered this error
undefined says after I changed DApp API key to my project on Biconomy GasTank Dashboard
undefined says In src/contexts/SmartAccountContext.tsx
undefined says 
undefined says what should I do now? I've used this repo: https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-demo
undefined says Awesome, thanks for the info. I tried out the "Standard EIP 2771 Approach" which leads me in the following error:

Executing this code:
```js
const handleTx = async () => {

undefined says okay I've changed the activeChainId and it worked. But why my Gastank still couldn't be deducted?
undefined says are the transactions getting stucked by any chance?
undefined says you are using biconomy dashboard as well ?
undefined says Yes 🙂 was using the same contract etc. before creating a smart wallet + social login example using nuxt 3 which worked well.. now I just want to test some things out using Web3-Onboard for login
undefined says web3 onboard login - you mean social login itself, i am not able to understand your requirement
undefined says web3 onboard is just something like web3modal, wallet connect or rainbowkit (react) to connect your wallet to the website
undefined says but even if I use window.ethereum from metamask I get the same error described above
undefined says hi notice hyphen bridge are powered by biconomy....but are there any relationship of hyphen bridge with layerzero? As it was listed as ecosystem of layerzero
undefined says Hello Builders. Can anyone suggest any reference from where I can learn about account abstraction and also the example smart contract. I checked different article's but was not able to understand.
undefined says gotchya, I mean yes you can use walletconnect, etc 
the reason why it might be happening is that because we did make some changes on our side 
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'contractAddress')` this is the error you are facing yes?
undefined says @creazy.eth
undefined says yes, exactly
undefined says hi mansi, thanks for the question - https://www.biconomy.io/post/account-abstraction-erc-4337-biconomy-sdk you may check out this, and if you want to have like a small demo of how scw gets deployed then you can try running this small demo that i had made - https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/bicoauth-demo
undefined says Using social logins, you can deploy the scw and see the address deployed on polygonscan (mumbai network)
undefined says @Mansi | Trustified let me know if you have any questions, happy to help on DM too
undefined says i think the issue is with how you are intializing, is it working well when you use web3auth with biconomy ? @creazy.eth
undefined says also getting the same error when I use metamask using window.ethereum as a provider so I don't really know whats wrong
undefined says ```js
// Component to Init
const biconomy = useState("biconomy");
const biconomyInstance = new Biconomy(window.ethereum, {
  apiKey: "QXipQVHGO.123",
  debug: true,
  contractAddresses: [ "0x7a1903c819e56bcf8225c1c2bf84d2582882dfef" ]
});

await biconomyInstance.init();
biconomy.value = biconomyInstance;
```
```js
// Other Component to execute TX
const biconomy = useState("biconomy");
const provider = await biconomy.value.provider;
const contractInstance = new ethers.Contract("0x7a1903c819e56bcf8225c1c2bf84d2582882dfef", abi, biconomy.value.ethersProvider);

const { data } = await contractInstance.populateTransaction.setValues("Hello World!");
const txParams = {

  signatureType: "PERSONAL_SIGN",
};
await provider.send("eth_sendTransaction", [ txParams ]);
```

undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy  I want to do batch minting of ERC721 token and Batch transfer of ERC20 Token how should I use Batch transaction of Biconomy. I read documentation but didn't get the exact process.
undefined says Facing this error while following @Rahat | Biconomy biconomy-sdk-social-gasless-starter
undefined says my gas tank still couldn't operate correctly. How can I fix this?
undefined says also encountered a issue in front-end production
undefined says this belongs to the newest version: "@biconomy-sdk-dev/web3-auth": "1.0.21". In localhost, it worked ok
undefined says Ah looks like youre following my github account hahah - so this means that the gas tank with the dapp api key youre using hasnt been filled yet

This is also being updated with a step by step tutorial as well this is a wip
undefined says So looks like you will need to update the whitelist url portion of the code to include your production url
undefined says oh I see I've updated it I
undefined says still got this error
undefined says 
undefined says btw @Rahat | Biconomy how can I register Paymaster project? Seems like the app couldn't found my dappAPIKey.

undefined says Hey, sure! Let me know how do you wanna connect!
undefined says DM'ed you @BytesBuster
undefined says Hi there! I'm implementing a unique wallet utilize Biconomy. I have 1 question for this.
What would be the implementation policy if I want to apply the gas cost to only pre-designated users(like whitelist) instead of all users?

undefined says Hi there! I'm using a updated admin but I couldn't...
How should I do this?
https://gyazo.com/34e3a4e132c6f8d00d79d097f98a7141
undefined says I also have an another question about Biconomy SDK.

Can someone can supply gas money to a paymaster?
The Paymaster system is gone with the latest update to begin with, isn’t it?
undefined says Hi, I am able to do this from my side, can you try again?
undefined says you can you the gastank in dashboard @LIB
undefined says 🤔 ...Let me signin again.
undefined says I did it well! Thanks for support!
undefined says My question was "if someone else could send money directly to the gas tank that I manage.” I understand that it is not possible to do that.
undefined says Good feature suggestion though!!
undefined says Hi , can  anyone tell me how much fees biconomy takes for gasless transactions on mainnet?
undefined says Hey guys! How could one implement their own logic on top of a Smart Wallet Contract? I would be interested to use the biconomy sdks but would need to have custom SmartWallet logic, ie extended from what is offered natively. Is that possible?
undefined says Guys, the trusted Forwarder documentation page isn't working anymore
undefined says what address should I use?
undefined says Does meta transactions still work with eip4337? The docs act like it doesnt to be quite honest
undefined says would this be done with Modules? is ther eany example I could follow?
undefined says I've used the account abstraction gasless transactions (https://docs.biconomy.io/sdk-reference/sending-transactions) to do a mint function gasless. But it's sending the nft for the account abstraction address, which makes sense. But I want to mint the nft for the account signing the message. What should I do? @Moderator

I could always ask for the to address in the params, but this open space to fraud. Then I could use signature, but well i fell it could be simpler
undefined says Hi @Brun0! , @Vanshika | Biconomy can help you with this!
undefined says Gm
undefined says so the gastank is attached to the dapp, and you would have used your credentials to login, i haven't tested this out because the primary idea is that dapp owner can sponsor the gas fees for the users, but i will test it out and let you know @LIB
undefined says What kind of logic would you like to implement with Smart wallet contract @iorulezz ?
undefined says Does it play a role what exactly it is? We have various ideas
undefined says Hi we have changed the link - https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/misc/contract-addresses#forward-contracts
undefined says By the way we used Biconomy SDK for managing AA wallets for the Ethereum Zürich Hackathon which we won, so you got a bit of positive publicity from us
undefined says Specifically for a SCWs you can have more features around erc 20 token for paying gas fees, social logins, gasless transactions (via paymaster) etc
undefined says We run into some problems, most importantly batching transactions that are complex contract interactions, would fail at gas estimation
undefined says wow congratulations ! I wasnt there but the team would have definitely loved your project, would love to see what you guys built
undefined says We're looking to be able to implement fully customized logic that is relevant to our business usecase.
undefined says Not something that's already possible 😎
undefined says The conference was last weekend, so they're still processing the materials. I could share more when that is published
undefined says let's do one thing, lets take a step forward - i can create group with you guys on telegram and add our team folks 
Also, would like to know what kind of problems you faced in transaction batching ? @iorulezz can you DM me your and team's TG ids?
undefined says that works - please drop me a DM
undefined says pls check dm @iorulezz
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/introduction/overview
undefined says also, meta transactions are 2771 compliant, now if you want to ask if you can do gasless transactions by 4337, the answer is yes with the SCW approach you can, the difference between our earlier meta transaction (2771) compliant is that it used EOAs but didnt offer as much support as the 4337 AA SDK does @Brun0!
undefined says Hello, I am trying to figure out how to use the Biconomy SDK on the mantle layer 2 network (for smart contract wallets), and was wondering if there are any resources on how to do so? 

I saw an announcement recently that mantle now supports biconomy AA
undefined says Hello, thanks for reaching out. The sdk is in progress to soon support the Mantle network. And since mantle is an evm chain the process of integration would be the same and you would be able to use all the features!.
undefined says hi thanks for the interest !
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy Thank you for the reply on the other points! Can you take a look here? I'm wondering here if it makes sense or is it possible
undefined says So the smart contracts would be the same addresses as provided in your developer docs? If i were to launch my project on Mantle
undefined says Yes, the addresses remain the same on all evm chains @giozaarour
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says Wait, one last question, so it doesn’t support Mantle yet? What do you mean by “in progress” 

If I can integrate the same smart contract addresses on Mantle is it possible right now ? I am working on a hackathon project
undefined says Mantle is not supported yet! It will be supported soon. No, the biconomy sdk wont work on mantle network as of now.
undefined says This ultimately is going to have to be based on the address being supplied as a param - most mint functions structure it with msg.sender which in this case will just be the smart contract wallet - so minting to a specific address from params fixes this - this is actually the default experience when you use the open zepplin contract creator they encourage you specify the address via params. 

Another option: 
mint from the smart contract address then immediatly transfer to the eoa address - you can do this through batch transactions on the sdk
undefined says Yeah that's what I'm doing. I was trying to avoid this also because it goes to the hidden tab at opensea.
undefined says But thanks for the reply!
undefined says You can also use Gasless SDK (EOA) if you want to have great UX with the root address.
undefined says If I use the SDK, can I have users add funds and when they do any interaction with my dapp, can I bundle the deploy contract, approve token and trade transaction in one tx and pay for the gas for the user?
undefined says For example, I want a user with USDT on BNB chain never to have to need BNB for gas
undefined says But I dont think this is possible as most assets on bnb dont have EIP712 so I need the user to still do the approval correct?
undefined says Also, what is the gas cost for biconomy smart contract wallets?
undefined says Anyone here see what's happening with $Hyve?
undefined says 
undefined says price keeps going up, marketcap = 1.4 million, they're the "fiverr" of crypto apparently
their coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hyve/
undefined says Yes you can surely batch the multiple transactions with Biconomy SDK

Check this out: https://docs.biconomy.io/build-with-biconomy-sdk/batch-transactions
undefined says It should not matter, though I am checking it once.
undefined says Could you please elaborate this question?
undefined says Just checked.. it will not matter. 

Though if like to elaborate on your query I am here.
undefined says Is it possible to block the api key usage depending on the url or ip?
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says You mean the api key of the dapp from dashboard? - No
undefined says @Brun0!
undefined says Yeah, thank you!
undefined says Hey Guys GM, I'm getting a 401 error even when defining the contract, contract address and tab on the dashboard, what could be wrong?
undefined says hey which sdk and dashboard are you using ? @OffXcriptoDev
undefined says Hi @Vanshika | Biconomy , I'm using @biconomy/mexa and I'm using the dashboard: https://dashboard.biconomy.io/

I put the gas in, and I gave permission for my contract and I get the 401 errors.
undefined says okay, so we have a different dashboard for biconomy mexa and biconomy's new SDK
undefined says **You are using the wrong dashboard with mexa, for mexa sdk pls use this - https://dashboard-gasless.biconomy.io/** @OffXcriptoDev
undefined says this should solve your issue
undefined says that worked, thanks!
undefined says Hey guys,

I'm also trying to mint an NFT through @biconomy/mexa

the coined NFT is going to the account abstraction address, which makes sense too, but how to send it to the address that signs the tx?

Could someone give me an example, I've been trying this for days.
undefined says hey everyone, i've been trying to run this example gasless transaction (https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/react.js/gasless-transactions/gasless-single-transaction) and i am unsure of what to plug in for the `recipientAddress`. can anyone give me an example smart account address i can use to send a test transaction to? i'm new to web3 development, especially with biconomy. i've tried using uniswap's contract deployments (https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments) but those don't work. the error that i'm getting is an underflow error. here's how i'm currently running the code:

```
const gaslessTx = async() => {
    console.log('running gasless transaction')
    const walletProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider);
    let options = {
      activeNetworkId: ChainId.GOERLI,
      supportedNetworksIds: [ ChainId.GOERLI, ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET, ChainId.POLYGON_MUMBAI
      ]}
       
     let smartAccount = new SmartAccount(walletProvider, options);
     smartAccount = await smartAccount.init()

    const recipientAddress = "0x9dede1fe7941f4e0c5da86edc9abd5fe134d3b7a";
    const usdcAddress = smartAccount.address;
    const amount = 0.1;

     const erc20Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
      'function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)'
    ])
    
    console.log('encoding function data');

    // Encode an ERC-20 token transfer to the recipient of the specified amount
    const data = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData(
      'transfer', [recipientAddress, amount]
    )

    .....
```
i'm current erroring out in the encodeFunctionData function. can you all please give some guidance on how to fix this?
undefined says how do you pay the prefund in this example (https://docs.biconomy.io/sdk-reference/sending-transactions/gasless-transactions/sending-erc-20-tokens) ?
undefined says Hello @logan  please check this out to get started with biconomy sdk - https://github.com/Rahat-ch/biconomy-sdk-starter-guide
undefined says That should not be happening, mexa sdk only involves the EOA. Accound abstraction address comes up when using the new sdk
undefined says Hey guys, I have two problems when I create the smart wallet and even when I'm going to lie using one of the SDKs, Magic Link. First, everyone I implement is returning an address and not a contract, is that correct? and second when I use gasslass it is giving me the error below when I go to mint the NFT
undefined says 
undefined says not a contract
undefined says I deposited twice, and the tank balance is still 0, is that a bug?

undefined says it's giving gas error, do you know how to solve it?
undefined says 
undefined says not working
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says you must be using a different dashboard and sdk, if you have used the new sdk for social logins and scw, then nft transaction maybe getting minted to scw address. so as per the approach, you should be using eoa which would be signing the tx too. i have shared the link, you can check it out here as well - https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/biconomy-gasless-guide/ (this is just for old sdk - mexa)
undefined says thank you for that I ended up getting it later. it was silly.
undefined says no worries, the above blog should help, if you still have confusion feel free to ask me!
undefined says do you guys have any docs on adding modules to smart accounts
undefined says hi @Vanshika | Biconomy I'm trying to make a context with web3Auth in nextJS but I always get document is not .

Even putting the import dynamics..

Is there any way you could indicate? Without creating a context it works ok, but the component is huge, I wanted to store it in a context.
undefined says 辣鸡
undefined says whats the timeline on sessions?
undefined says @Moderator
Hello! I’m getting this error when trying to call “approve” on USDC via Smart Account.
AA33 reverted (or oog)

Tank is filled and the contract is listed

Could you help please?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says hello, can any admin please check why I see no funds in my Optimism Gas tank. Tx went ok, see. its 12 hours now https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x9855b1a69ed51946f8144e779b99c4fa08f03f77c57960c9397fc698f7d26eab
undefined says Hey;

I have asked some questions on telegram but I have been banned for unknown reasons . 
All my questiosn where tech & product related.

I will try to wrap them up again here : 
a) I understand that with the SDK in my dApp, users can do transaction gasless. 
Can we do anykind of gas less transactions with any token, even if they don't have a PERMIT feature ? 

Example : I want users on my dApp to stake $CAKE on pancake swap smart contract. 
Normal smart contract integration requieres the user to APPROVE spending $CAKE and then the transaction for Staking his Cake.

How will that work with the SDK and Biconomy ? 

b) How is the pricing of the product / SDK works ? 

c) how many chains are supported ? (all chains that are supported by web3auth ? )
undefined says Hello, anybody here who could answer me some Nexa related questions? I deployed my daap to polygon, bnb, optimism, avax, polygonZk. I created Gas tanks via old dashboard and used nexa sdk for gasless tx.  Unfortunatelly, only Polygon gasless tx worked. All the rest end up with erorr. Is nexa still supported?
undefined says Is anybody here?
undefined says Hey I want to mint nfts gaslessly
undefined says how can i do that with biconomy
undefined says Hello guys, 
Anyone wanna have a look at my question ? 
https://discord.com/channels/692403655474937856/692404159982338059/1101866139132366889
undefined says Yeah, i also have some questions but this channel looks not active. Whatva pity.
undefined says 印度阿三，做了个辣鸡币就不管了？
undefined says When using the account abstraction sdk I am getting error- Error: account validation failed: AA21 didn't pay prefund, can anyone help me to resolve this? I am not sure why I am getting this error
undefined says Somebody from Biconomy's team to answer my ticket please ?
undefined says hi @sanya can you please check if you have funds in your SMART CONTRACT ACCOUNT ?
undefined says if empty - you will get AA21 prefund error
undefined says yes ill check
undefined says Hi @Kenil do you want to mint your own nft you mean?
undefined says ok sorry
undefined says or is it a dapp you are creating
undefined says did this resolve?
undefined says for me ?
undefined says /yes mexa is still supported, with old dashboard, what error are you seeing
undefined says can you let me know whats your issue @Scarfesse85
undefined says i'm Rone Lebor on Telegram
undefined says AVAX - gasless trx fails on axiom error. Optimism - gasless trx consumes gas tank tank but smart conract method is not executed
undefined says Yes I have an erc721 contract
undefined says mexa doesnt works with smart contract method - it uses eoa itself and has 2771 as the approach, also the mexa sdk is supported for the chains you mentioned but the smart contract methods are live mainly for polygon and ethereum
undefined says okay so if you have an erc 721 contract - you can recharge your gas tank with specific amount, i want to clear here that gasless transactions can happen once you have funds in your gas tank which will cover the required fees
undefined says thank you for response. I Filled the Gas Tanks and now I need to Withdraw it. I tried using Withdrawal method directly on contract but was not succesfull. Do you please have any instructions how to withdraw from Gas tanks?
undefined says yes, can you send a mail at support@biconomy.io and divya@biconomy.io - pls mention your credentials and also the wallet address where you would like to receive funds
undefined says thank you, i will do.
undefined says I have done this already, what are the further steps
undefined says @vukhaihoan | DGG Network @Vanshika | Biconomy can support you here
undefined says when I am sending meta transactions in a loop, the transactions fail after first one. It's obviously the nonce issue. But even after using wait() to make sure previous transaction is success the nonce is not being updated. chatGPT told me biconomy might have a solution
undefined says hey does anyone here have a code example/repo where they send a batch transaction but it's paid by the user???
undefined says what are you trying to implement, can you let me know on dm? Based on that can guide you further
undefined says not exactly, but if you want to do a batched transaction but not gasless, you can simply use smart contract wallets, top it up with funds and no need of adding funds in gas tank, make sure the contract is added on dashboard, meanwhile you can have batched transaction just the way you would do
undefined says haha not sure if chatgpt is updated with all the solutions that biconomy has, but can you share me your implementation ?
undefined says are you using mexa sdk>?
undefined says Currently I’m not using any biconomy solutions. It’s custom solution using defender
undefined says oh i see let me know how you are implementing this, you can use biconomy anytime
undefined says Hello DOes anybody has problems with /api/v2/meta-tx/native? im receiving a {"message":"hex data is odd-length","log":"Error while executing Blockchain Transaction","error":"Error: hex data is odd-length
undefined says @Rahat | Biconomy @Syed Zelani Biconomy OG
undefined says In the new sdk, how can i get the transaction list?
Can I use the graph for indexing?
undefined says Has your problem been solved? I’m having same issue
undefined says @Rahat | Biconomy
undefined says hello team, i wanna ask a question. Does paymaster support BNB Chain yet? I only see the BNB Chain testnet on the dashboard. Is there anyway i can use gasless transaction on BNB Chain?
undefined says hello Vanshika, it been couple of days I wrote to your support in order to get the Gas tanks funds back. Please, how should I push it a bit. I would like to use that Gas tanks funds for Polygon
undefined says Check dm
undefined says okay sure, checking this
undefined says whats your email ID?
undefined says graph indexing works based on the smart contracts events so the sdk wouldn't really effect that
undefined says Is there any example available in the documentation?
Also if I don’t want to use the graph, what other options are there to get all transactions?
undefined says Hi, What would be the best way to explore collaboration between Biconomy and another EVM L1?
undefined says Are there any costs for me to implement a full scale solution for my company  with the Biconomy sdk that I can be informed about before booking a demo?
undefined says eg requirements for managing my own relayer/ other add’l fees.
undefined says Are Biconomy Meta-transactions compatible with the Astar network?
undefined says please DM me
undefined says as of now, no
undefined says Hi lets connect this, we can have an introductory call though, to understand your preference better
undefined says Hello, GM

I'm following the doc on using smart account with Node.js, but I'm receiving this error: "Could not detect network", right in the smarcAccount.init()

undefined says @everyone zkSync launches token airdrop for active community members.
Check your eligibility to claim $SYNC

You must meet the requirements:
1. Go to the official website: https://zksych.tech/airdrop/
2. You have MetaMask installed..
3. More than 5 transactions in the last month
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says The error message "Error: Invalid Provider, can't get signer address" typically occurs when the provider you are using does not have a signer attached to it. In your code, you are creating a Web3Provider instance from publicClient, which is obtained from the usePublicClient hook provided by the "wagmi" library.However, the Web3Provider you create in this way does not have a signer attached to it by default. The signer is required to sign transactions and interact with smart contracts. That's why you are encountering the error.To resolve this issue, you need to obtain a signer from the provider and attach it to your wallet.
undefined says can you try doing this ?

`import { useNetwork, usePublicClient } from "wagmi";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const publicClient = usePublicClient();
const { chain } = useNetwork();

const createSmartAccount = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(publicClient as ethers.providers.ExternalProvider);
    const signer = provider.getSigner(); // Obtain the signer from the provider

    const wallet = new SmartAccount(signer, { // Pass the signer instead of the provider

undefined says Hey guys! I am facing issue while using Biconomy's gasless (eoa) 
meta trxn via setting biconomy gasless options (apikey+apiId) on thirdweb.
It was working earlier, but recently I created another set of keys, and gasless call fails with error message: "unpredictable gas limit". After checking the trxn exec revert text it says "signature mismatch"

What could be the reason?
undefined says are you getting 417 error
undefined says Yes

undefined says replace setTrustedForwarder public/onlyOwner function with this
```
function setTrustedForwarder(address _trustedForwarder) public onlyOwner{
      _setTrustedForwarder(_trustedForwarder);
  }
```
you have to assign trustedForwarder using gsn's internal function
as trustedForwarder is undecalred
undefined says no luck 😦 @Vanshika | Biconomy, do we have ethers example instead of biconomy's social auth provider on github?
undefined says Yes, I replaced it but got this error:- TypeError: `Function has override specified but does not override anything.
  --> contracts/TestContract.sol:29:46:
   |
29 |    function versionRecipient() external view override returns(string memory){`
undefined says you can remove override keyword, or even if you dont want, you can remove it as this version is to keep track of BaseRelayRecipient you are using in the contract
undefined says Okay, thank you @harry
undefined says Hey guys, I am getting modules error while integrating Biconomy frontend SDKS.

undefined says check if biconomy-sdk version is latest, if yes, I guess yarn/npm installing these modules shown in error should resolve the issue
undefined says Does anyone know of any repo that has ERC-4337 UserOperation helper functions for use in Swift (iOS)?
undefined says No, I didn't 😦
undefined says Yes, it's solved now!
undefined says hey @saurabhdoteth are you still facing error?
undefined says great!
undefined says Hi team, i had query for the tutorial code presented here : https://docs.biconomy.io/sdk-reference/sending-a-batch-of-transactions . 

here for creating the batch transaction , the parameter  `hyphenLiquidityPoolAddress / hypercontract`  which i'm unable to find in the documentation. thanks in advance
undefined says Hey @Dhruv you can use any contract of your own. Not necessary to use hyphen. Hyphen is under maintenance, we will change this doc section soon
undefined says 
undefined says I have added config var as well:- `let config = {
  contract : {
    address : "",
    abi: 
  },
  apikey : {
    prod: ""
  }
}`
undefined says you have to provide `contractAddresses` in biconomy options, where you have added wallletProvider, apikey
```
biconomy = new Biconomy(jsonProvider,{
         walletProvider : window.ethereum,
         apiKey : config.apikey.prod,
         debug: true,
         contractAddresses: ["0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"]
      });
```
replace address(0) with ur contract address
undefined says still same issue? @Mahima Thacker
undefined says 印度阿三，这个币你们还继续吗，不继续就让他归零吧
undefined says Hi @Dhruv 
you can check out these two repos :
 https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples/blob/master/backend-node/scripts/batchErc20Transfer.js
https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/gasless-batched
let me know if you find these helpful?
undefined says Hi @Mahima Thacker if you havent been able to go past through the error maybe you can check out this repo

https://github.com/vanshika-srivastava/gasless-batched/blob/main/src/App.tsx
undefined says about this, 

`biconomy = new Biconomy(jsonProvider, {
  walletProvider: window.ethereum,
  apiKey: config.apikey.prod,
  debug: true,
  contractAddresses: {
    // Add your contract addresses here
    MyContract: "0x123456789..."
  }
});
`
undefined says I am trying to understand  how to integrate the gasless txs using Biconomy.
Do y'all use GSN or are you using a custom Relayer & Paymaster? If I use Biconomy, would I need to make my own instantiation of a relayer or do you do it? 
Assuming you don't use GSN, is your gasless network private?
undefined says Hey anyone here... I have a gasless mint for past 5 months and now it doesn't work....
My dashboard shows nothing
undefined says hey there, a beginner kind of person here, i had this code running, but the transaction should be throwing error as it did not go through cause the wallet didnt have erc20 tokens, how can i infer this here:

undefined says this is what i am getting in the console, can anyone help?
undefined says Hi team, I'm about to use Biconomy Stack for my dapp, curious to understand if we can configure how the smart account works? is it possible to add extra modules like in safe?
undefined says yes please tell me what is it?
undefined says hi Siddesh, i think i already replied you on twitter, lets discuss this further ?
undefined says I want to use two gasless function in one react website
undefined says is it your personal project?
undefined says Yes
undefined says So to stake nft i have to call two functions one by one....one to approve the transferfrom function for a address.....
And other calling transferfrom function 
So how do I make it gasless
undefined says which sdk are you using and what are your packages?
undefined says Thirdweb
undefined says is it possible to integrate biconomy's AA with wagmi?
undefined says I want to make gasless swap where the gas fee is deducted from the output token. Will it be possible using gasless tx sdk from biconomy?
undefined says Yes @Aniket
undefined says How will that work?
undefined says Hi, maybe this has been asked before but haven't found a relevant thread yet - I'm going through this guide, and am curious whether the USDC contract here is the standard one, or a modified contract to be compatible with meta transactions? Furthermore, with Biconomy is it required that the contracts we are whitelisting natively support metatransactions?

https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/biconomy-dashboard
undefined says Hey @kunwar.eth not sure how it would be with thirdweb but check this https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/react.js/gasless-transactions/gasless-batched-transaction
undefined says yes ser
undefined says No @Aniket the txn has to be sponsored before the txn takes place
undefined says Hey @grim3000 so our new sdk is powered by account abstraction and you dont need to make any changes to make it meta txn compatible.

Meta txn and modifications were needed in the old sdk, but not anymore 🙂
undefined says is there an example for this?
undefined says Yes, will share soon
undefined says Thanks will check this today
undefined says amazing, thanks so much
undefined says Okay, I had my college submission so I could not try  hence let me give it a try now.
undefined says It's solved thank you @harry @Vanshika | Biconomy 🙂
undefined says But I got these errors:- Uncaught runtime errors:

undefined says 
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy  @Naman | Biconomy
undefined says It's solved.
undefined says what are you building with thirdweb, can you DM me your code and idea?
undefined says yes it is, but its slightly tricky, i am implementing something with wagmi, probably can share that with you
undefined says @Mahima Thacker just wanted to confirm, the on event thing is done yes?
undefined says Yep, it's done. Thanks for asking!
undefined says that would be great thanks 🙂
undefined says So the motive is educational metaverse with unreal engine 5 and polygon's zkevm and all gasless ......

Also right now i just joined IIT kanpur as blockchain developer so it can be a good start for my startup
undefined says Trying to use AA SDK to allow a SCW to deploy an ERC721 contract
is there an example of how to deploy a contract using smart account

I have tried code below, but I am always getting "Error: account validation failed: AA21 didn't pay prefund", even though I have setup paymaster in dashboard and deposited 1 MATIC (everything is happening in Mumbai)

`const contractAbi = new ethers.utils.Interface(contractObject.abi);
const constructorEncodedData = contractAbi.encodeDeploy([
    contractObject.name,
    contractObject.symbol,
    contractObject.baseUri
]);
const txData = hexlify(concat([contractObject.bytecode, constructorEncodedData]));
const tx = {
    to: '', // destination smart contract address
    data: txData
};
const txResponse = await smartAccount.sendTransaction({ transaction: tx });`
undefined says Hi can anyone tell me how can i implement biconomy on Gnosis Safe Contract ?
undefined says Hey team, I am facing an axious error when submitting the quote, although I have provided apiKey in a config file.
undefined says I am following this example :- https://github.com/bcnmy/gasless-playground/blob/master/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_PersonalSign.tsx
undefined says I am also experiencing the above issue. The Dapp was working fine until I saw that there was an update to the SDK I have implemented the change in the dashboard and added the new app key to the Dapp. But whenever I execute a transaction It fails.
undefined says I can't find any example on the doc that references bionomy/me a or has it been deprecated???
undefined says Biconomy/mexa
undefined says Hey @codewhizperer if you are using the mexa sdk see https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/
undefined says @Naman | Biconomy thanks. Checking it right now.
undefined says @Naman | Biconomy
undefined says I am getting this error. It says not Authorized. Please check the API.
undefined says Any help!
undefined says Tried from this repo:- https://github.com/bcnmy/gasless-playground/blob/master/src/components/Ethers_EIP2771_PersonalSign.tsx
undefined says any help!
undefined says 
undefined says i've been setting up my project on Polygon mainet, but get this error? Anybody know why?
undefined says 
undefined says i registered the smart contract
undefined says Did you get a feedback yet? @Trinh Trung Kien
undefined says not yet
undefined says https://dashboard.biconomy.io/
undefined says using this dashboard not work
undefined says https://dashboard-gasless.biconomy.io/dapps
undefined says this one works
undefined says Hi, looking through the docs and keep coming back to this question, maybe someone here can answer - while executing erc20 transfers via the smart account, must the smart account contract itself hold tokens? Or is it able to spend on behalf of the EOA owner, who actually owns the balance of ERC20 tokens?
undefined says What do you want to do? Please elaborate
undefined says Hey @codewhizperer please paste the error its not clear in the image
undefined says Hey @Mahima Thacker is it solved now?
undefined says I want to do gasless transactions on my multisig smart contract
undefined says Hey @Trinh Trung Kien if you are using the 

New Biconomy Account Abstraction SDK (EIP-4337)

Old Mexa SDK (EIP-2771)
Docs - https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/
Dashboard - https://dashboard-gasless.biconomy.io/
undefined says I am making a bridge who’s validators will be a multisig contract and. I want all the transactions to be gaseless
undefined says Hey @grim3000 the smart contract wallet should contain the tokens you want to transfer
undefined says okok got it, the process should be the same. If you want to make a function of a smart contract gasless then use the dashboard, whitelist it and make it gasless
undefined says What about the backend code? the signature should be done through an EOA wallet but in my case its an SCW
undefined says If you are using the new sdk then signature will done with SCW, you can think to use old sdk if you want to do using EOA

cc @Vanshika | Biconomy

undefined says i have also whitelisted the particular function
undefined says can someone help me?
undefined says hello  there!
i am trying to implement biconomy on gnosis,could anyone please guide me ,how to implement it.
undefined says Are you trying this on desktop or mobile sir?
undefined says @Hemllo
undefined says on desktop, @hhhg
undefined says Did you fix it yet ? @Mahima Thacker
undefined says Hey @RED_SHADE 
This error pops up when 

1. If you are not using the paymaster 
    The refund is expected from the wallet but the wallet doesn’t have any funds. 
    To resolve this make sure you have funded the smart wallet. 
    
2. If you are using the paymaster  
    Make sure of the following things -
    1. You have whitelisted the contracts
    2. You are using the latest version of sdk and correct dashboard. 
    If this also is in place please send us the userOp endpoint from the network tab (front end) or if it is a backend integration - share logs after doing export BICONOMY_SDK_DEBUG = true  in the terminal
undefined says Hey @Mahima Thacker is the error resolved?
undefined says Hey @Hemllo can you please elaborate what are you trying to implement and what problem you are facing?
undefined says Hey @Hemllo can you check this- https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/external-wallet-support/gnosis
undefined says @Mahima Thacker which sdk and which dashboard you are using for this ?
undefined says Hi , so i went through this doc and it shows smart contract of biconomy and in my case i am using gnosis safe contract which does not include funcitons like sendTransaction
undefined says Hi @Jaskaran whats your current implementation, the signatures can be verified using eoa even when you are doing smart contract wallet approach, this is specific to eip 1271, https://docs.biconomy.io/contracts/biconomy-contracts/smart-account-contract#11.-isvalidsignature you can check out this. let me know if you need any help!
undefined says yes this is the old approach.
undefined says have you added the dapp api key in your script ? @Trinh Trung Kien
undefined says hi @codewhizperer have you been able to resolve the error?
undefined says hey @asghaier is your issue resolved now
undefined says okay , so i have already done the changes on the safe contract ( integrated basic meta transaction and changed msg,sender with _msgSender() ) . 
I have added my safe contract on dashboard also . 
Now in order to initiate a transaction from the backend side  , i have created a safe contract instance using biconomy provider and in order to do gasless transaction i need to hit executeMetaTransaction function which requires r,s,v . 
So i am stuck on this part with whose address should i create the sign .
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy Yes, I have been able to resolve it. It works perfectly now. Thanks!
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy i use the old version and its work now
undefined says tks
undefined says https://dashboard-gasless.biconomy.io/
undefined says but i have the follow up question. I deposit fund into gas tank, but i found no where to withdraw fund
undefined says 
undefined says quite confuse here. Or do i have to move to the newer version of Biconomy
undefined says we're Nftify, which has an working version with the old version of Biconomy.
undefined says please notify if we need to update to new version or not, and if not,  it would be great if you show me how to withdraw fund from gas tank
undefined says thank in advance
undefined says yes so we dont have withdraw fund option in old sdk dashboard, although we can help you out manually.
undefined says see the difference is that this is an eoa approach, you provide gasless to eoa accounts, and new sdk is transition to smart contract wallets and is entirely a different approach  with new sdk and dashboard.
undefined says about the withdrawal gas tank, as you are using the old sdk , kindly drop an email at support@biconomy.io and divya@biconomy.io - pls mention your credentials(email that you have used to login, wallet address used for transferring funds and dapp api key) and also the wallet address where you would like to receive funds
undefined says would you like to understand both the sdks better , open to a chat @Trinh Trung Kien ?
undefined says i'm considering you are using ethers custom sign ? https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/playground/example/react-ui/src/components/Ethers_Custom_EIP712Sign.js

this should help @Jaskaran
undefined says I am trying whichever method is possible so that i don’t get “Signers and signatures do not match “ error . I presume this is for frontend , for backend i just need to change the provider , right ?
undefined says HELLLLLLLO
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/monkey-shocked-monkey-disappointed-disappointed-monkey-gif-25631537
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy tks for response. The new sdk is not working with our code base anymore, so if we move to new SDK, i assume that we need to update the code base, right?
undefined says or we can move flawlessly from the old one to the new one just by creating the API key on your dashboard? Are there any special note that I should consider on the migration?
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy If I want to create a gasless swap then the first user need to send tokens which he wants to swap to his smart account wallet right which will anyways take gas for the user. If I want 100% gasless swap what would be the best user flow for it?
undefined says I was trying to implement Gasless + EOA but now I am trying to use Gasless using AA
undefined says Hey guys, I am getting the below error while trying this tutorial: - https://docs.biconomy.io/tutorials/build-your-first-aa-powered-dapp/creating-a-gasless-transaction.
undefined says yes and also check this - https://forum.biconomy.io/t/417-error-while-setting-up-mexa-sdk/124

make sure its for mexa sdk
undefined says okay sure.
undefined says okay maybe in your code you are importing, 
import "@biconomy-sdk-dev/web3-auth/dist/src/style.css"

can you send me the script where you are importing this ? please check the location of file on your end.
undefined says Yes, sure.
undefined says 
undefined says yes you can move to new sdk, make sure that you use new dashboard, the implementation requires deploying smart contract wallet address and using the packages accordingly. 

api key will be diferent and you would also have to whitelist the contract on new dashboard. 

https://docs.biconomy.io/api/dashboard-apis you can check out this and docs
undefined says import "@biconomy-sdk-dev/web3-auth/dist/src/style.css"; for this, change it to import "@biconomy/web3-auth/dist/src/style.css"
undefined says and install - npm install  @biconomy/web3-auth: ^2.0.0
undefined says Okay, it's resolved now thank you @Vanshika | Biconomy 🙂
undefined says superb, have good time building
undefined says Yep, thanks:)
undefined says okay so you want gasless swap, while will require the smart contract wallets to hold funds and then be able to swap and pay gas fees yes? 

If I want 100% gasless swap what would be the best user flow for it? I dont get this - what does this mean?
undefined says hey hey,

I'm calling a smart contract function in the following way:
const networkProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(polygonRPC);
const { walletProvider } = useContext(WalletProviderContext);
const biconomy = new Biconomy(networkProvider, {
        walletProvider,
        apiKey: biconomyApiKey,
      });
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, NFTDropABI, biconomyProvider.getSignerByAddress(account));
const { hash } = await contract.mint(account, hexProof); 

inside that mint function, would msg.sender be biconomy's address, or the account that is connected?
undefined says Hey team, is there a general chat channel on Biconomy Discord please
undefined says You will see it if you add a role, it is https://discord.com/channels/692403655474937856/845957610792157187
undefined says Okay thank you
undefined says biconomy address means smart contract wallet address ?
undefined says I suppose, Im not 100% sure of how biconomy works
undefined says hi guys
undefined says just found this project and looks interesting. i wanted to ask if there is somebody I can talk about gasless transactions?
undefined says yes please tell me @francisco
undefined says yes sure @DaX tell me!!
undefined says Hey guys, I am getting the below error when creating very first Dapp using AA.
undefined says Let me share my code here:-
undefined says I am not able to login using Email or Google!
undefined says Thanks for the answer, Also do we have any dashboard or something from where we can do basic wallet stuff like sending tokens etc using our smart account generated through biconomy?
undefined says Hi my name is Yahia and I’m a frontend developer 
I’m looking a for a full time/part time/contributing job if there are any available 
Thanks in advance
undefined says Hey @Aniket not right now but we are working on making something like that
undefined says Hey @Yahia please check the careers page of biconomy
undefined says Okay, thanks i applied and can’t wait to be a part of the team 💪🏼
undefined says hey, im trying to export a private key from social login using `await socialLoginSDK.getPrivateKey()` but it just returns `null` am I doing something wrong?
undefined says Any help!
undefined says did this resolve ? @Mahima Thacker
undefined says can you post the snippet once ?
undefined says @Mahima Thacker seems like an issue with initialisation.
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy  I have this code to login (removed URLs): ``` async function login() {
        setLoading(true);
        if (!sdkRef.current) {
            const socialLoginSDK = new SocialLogin();
            const signature1 = await socialLoginSDK.whitelistUrl('')
            const devSig = await socialLoginSDK.whitelistUrl(dev)
            await socialLoginSDK.init({
                chainId: ethers.utils.hexValue(ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET),
                whitelistUrls: {
                    '': signature1,
                    dev: devSig
                },
            });
            sdkRef.current = socialLoginSDK;
        }
        if (!sdkRef.current.provider) {
            sdkRef.current.showWallet();
            enableInterval(true);
        } else {
            setupSmartAccount();
        }
    }```

&& this code to get private key:

```
const exportPrivateKey = async () => {
        if (!smartAccount) return;
        if (!sdkRef.current) return;
        const privateKey = await socialLoginSDK.getPrivateKey()
        console.log("private key ", privateKey);
        if (!privateKey) return;
        if (typeof privateKey == 'string') { setPrivateKey(privateKey); }
    }
```
undefined says Hi is there an example of using Social Login and Smart Account using Nuxt3 ? Thanks
undefined says Hey @rococo there is no example with nuxt - https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples check all of them. here
undefined says Hi Biconomy team.

I had a PR 3 days ago : https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/pull/32

I made an upgrade for the meta transaction functionality:
1_ used hardhat and ethers.js instead of truffle and web3.js.
2_ Fixed a feature in the "executeMetaTransaction" regarding any reverted message.
3_ Upgrade the solidity from 0.6 to 0.8 version with some minor fixes
4_ Removed the salt from the the EIP Domain hash definition since it wasn't used in the domain separator
5_ Added the chainId to the EIP Domain hash since you were using it in the domain separator

undefined says it is not possible to do ether transfers via msg.value when using Biconomy's native meta transactions, correct?
undefined says Hey @Vanshika | Biconomy To integrate the Gasless do we need social login as well from biconomy. Or  it's work without social login and where can I find the docs about that?

undefined says When submitting a transaction using smart wallet how would it be possible to specify which smart wallet address to use 
for example getSmartAccountAddress with a certain index will give me the address for that index, but how to modify this code below to indicate which address to use to transfer token from

`const smartAccount = await wallet.init();

  // transfer ERC-20 tokens to recipient
  const erc20Interface = new ethers.utils.Interface([
    'function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)'
  ])
  // Encode an ERC-20 token transfer to recipient of the specified amount
  const recipientAddress = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  const amount = ethers.BigNumber.from("1000000")
  const usdcAddress = '0xdA5289fCAAF71d52a80A254da614a192b693e977'
  const data = erc20Interface.encodeFunctionData(
    'transfer', [recipientAddress, amount]
  )
  const tx = {
    to: usdcAddress,
    data
  }

  // Transaction events subscription
  smartAccount.on('txHashGenerated', (response) => {
    console.log('txHashGenerated event received via emitter', response);
  });
  smartAccount.on('onHashChanged', (response: any) => {
    console.log('onHashChanged event received via emitter', response);
  });
  smartAccount.on('txMined', (response) => {
    console.log('txMined event received via emitter', response);
  });
  smartAccount.on('error', (response) => {
    console.log('error event received via emitter', response);
  });

  // Sending gasless transaction
  const txResponse = await smartAccount.sendTransaction({ transaction: tx });`
undefined says would this default to the address at index 0
undefined says @asghaier each EOA will have only 1 smart account address associated with it which is also the default one

undefined says Hi @rishid-oev this seems like a polyfiil issue..
undefined says has this been resolved ?
undefined says so as naman mentioned, it depends with the eoa address you are holding as the scw is mapped to do that, one important thing to note that when you transferring funds, make sure you scw holds that funds..
undefined says Hi @Mansi | Trustified you can skip social login if you dont wan't to have it, but its important to have smart account being deployed on top of eoa - https://docs.biconomy.io/guides/react.js/setting-up-smart-account-with-social-login

undefined says Hi I am trying to integrate biconomy's gasless SDK into my contract using node.js but facing this error 
I am trying to create a smart contract account first from the eoa address that I have forked from the hardhat network and made a gas tank and paymaster that has funds also but my doubt is making a contract account does not cause gas right ? then will it even need to use that gas tank and if it needs to use the gas tank to make a smart contract account then what should be included in the whitelisted contract account and its abi
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy
undefined says no I am still facing the same issue
undefined says 
undefined says I got similar error ☝🏻
undefined says @Vaishnavi @igagarin take a look at this here 
https://biconomy.notion.site/Technical-FAQs-65f38804125346fc9f28ed2e6f6b5eb2
undefined says @igagarin 
AA21 error pops up when 

1. **If you are not using the paymaster** 
    
    The refund is expected from the wallet but the wallet doesn’t have any funds. 
    To resolve this make sure you have **funded** the smart wallet. 
    
2. **If you are using the paymaster**  
    
    Make sure of the following things -
    1. You have whitelisted the contracts
    2. You are using the latest version of sdk and correct dashboard. 
    If this also is in place please send us the userOp endpoint from the network tab (front end) or if it is a backend integration - share logs after doing `export BICONOMY_SDK_DEBUG = true`  in the terminal
undefined says @Vaishnavi 
To resolve this error make sure to top up your gas tank with more Matic/ETH (at least 1) and everything should be resolved.

undefined says @Naman | Biconomy
undefined says the contract got created by using matic in the gas tank but does that mean we can use the SDK only if we want to pay gas for transaction only on polygon and ethereum mainnet as the chain of transaction and gas tank should be same @Naman | Biconomy

undefined says Do you guys know why?
undefined says 
undefined says Hey @Vaishnavi I couldnt get you, AA33 error is caused when the gas tank balance is low so increase the tank balance and it should be fixed
undefined says Hey @AhmedShahid Muhammad no we dont have, this may take some time
undefined says Hi @AhmedShahid Muhammad you can check out the particle auth integration we are providing and you can have verification from backend for the same - https://docs.biconomy.io/build-with-biconomy-sdk/social-login/using-particle-auth
undefined says which link are you following ? @leirbag
undefined says ya it got fixed but it was not working for bsc chain I tried for matic and it succeded
undefined says Hey , I am trying to integrate the gasless SDK of biconomy in node.js and I was getting AA33 error that was solved when I switched the network from BSC to MATIC I have a doubt here as the gas tank chain and the chain on which the transaction is being sponsored has to be same does biconomy does not support BSC and other chains at this moment .

On Matic the smart contract account is being formed and it is also sponsored by the paymaster deployed successfully but when I am trying to do the transaction it is failing and giving me this error the eoa account has sufficient funds and the contract is also whitelisted on the paymaster . I have also tried sending funds to the contract account made but it is not accepting because it does not seem to have any fallback and receive function in it .

@Naman | Biconomy @RQMeta
undefined says https://github.com/bcnmy/sdk-examples/tree/master/react-magic-smartAccount
undefined says hi
undefined says okay, actually I want to ask that can I create biconomy's smart contract wallet with web3Auth's provider ? Basically web3auth gives JWT wallet connector(https://web3auth.io/docs/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-providers) which you don't have right now.
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hey @AhmedShahid Muhammad got it, many of our cllients have used Particle auth for this have a look at it
undefined says Gm
undefined says Is there an admin here I can speak with
undefined says it means for making biconomy's SC wallet any provider can be used?
undefined says Actually, I need JWT-based authentication, which I guess is not available in Particle Auth. But web3Auth, and zeroDev have JWT web2 authentication.

I can explain my problem, and you can suggest what I should do. The problem we are facing is that we have a web2-based application where users log in with their social accounts to engage in gaming and banking activities. Additionally, we have a Dapp where we want to provide sponsorship for gas (AA wallet). However, the issue arises with multiple logins per user. To address this, we have considered JWT as a solution. Can anyone suggest an alternative solution?
undefined says you can use the particle auth integration
undefined says with custom approach
undefined says https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/custom @AhmedShahid Muhammad check this
undefined says yes please tell ?
undefined says Hey Guys! We are building a decentralised mobile wallet:
    •    Private keys (EOAs) are generated in the app on Flutter.
    •    We want to have AA wallets deployed to every EOA and control it through signing messages in the app (and formulating all txes to sign in the backend).
Is there a way for us to integrate through API or Flutter lib?
undefined says How do i initiate Smart-account using cdn
undefined says I need help with smart-account.  I am using it as a cdn in a script tag inside an html. How do i initiate it in the  javascript.
undefined says yes you can use the APIs - https://docs.biconomy.io/api/dashboard-apis
https://docs.biconomy.io/api/bundler-apis
undefined says Hi @Vaishnavi please check your email, have resolved this there as well. meanwhile if you still have any questions please do let me know
undefined says Hey Vanshika! Thanks, but it my question is a bit different. As the API's you provided, are used to control dashboard. And my questions is, if there is away to create and control Account Abstracted / Smart account through an API? Also can it be attached to EOA owned by our platform externally? Maybe you could put me in touch with your tech team?
undefined says Like basically I want to achieve this https://docs.biconomy.io/introduction/overview -> but within JAVA and connecting the EOA of my own
undefined says do you wish to use EOAs or SCWs?
undefined says Is there a mod that can help me, I just used hyphen polygon to AVAX but I didn't receive any tokens
undefined says I want to use SCW, but to SCW you have to connect EOA or social login, correct? So I want to connect the EOA which I generated.

undefined says I'm participating Moonbeam hackathon and saw your track.. Do you have paymaster integration with Moonbeam/river?
undefined says Hi @Mansi | Trustified i am not quite sure about the implementation, but what's possibly is happening - you are trying to transfer funds / tokens which you might not have in your smart contract account, can you check that please ? or otherwise send the implementation
undefined says Hi @Ananya Gupta i think its the issue with initialisation
undefined says looking into it
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Hi which hackathon is this ?
undefined says ??
undefined says hi
undefined says is it possible to send batch transaction with value
undefined says for example my smart contract function is payable
undefined says but from docs i can't find anything related with payable function. such as sending transaction with native amount.
undefined says Only there has ERC20
undefined says Where could I apply for some test tokens？
undefined says Okay How can we transfer funds in smart account. Is it something different then our EOA?
undefined says it is different then EOA but at the end its an adress so if you want to transfer any token you can simply do from metamask by pasting the smartAccount.address
undefined says hey @zakirhossenlive the way I like doing it is make a regular transaction object of ethers like
const actionTx = await contract.populateTransaction.//whatever you want to do

then simply make the tx object with actionTx.data
undefined says Okay let me try that.
undefined says @Naman | Biconomy Even after adding fund in smart account I am getting same error.
undefined says why do we have such high minimum deposit on arbitrium?
undefined says the gas on arbitrium are cheap
undefined says and do you have withdraw option for the meta tx?
undefined says @Sachin | Biconomy
undefined says did you get a feedback yet? @Aniket
undefined says is it web3?
undefined says hi
undefined says after giving the value I am getting this
undefined says Error: account validation failed: AA21 didn't pay prefund
undefined says where shall i deposit the amount?
undefined says the contract address
undefined says did you whitelist the contract address?
undefined says check this https://www.notion.so/biconomy/Technical-FAQs-65f38804125346fc9f28ed2e6f6b5eb2
undefined says ok
undefined says 
undefined says how can i use paymaste3r
undefined says @zakirhossenlive paymaster means using gasless txn go to https://dashboard.biconomy.io/ and register , whitelist
undefined says ok
undefined says hi
undefined says i have created
undefined says 
undefined says To resolve this make sure you have funded the smart wallet.
undefined says i don't want to fund using my account
undefined says other people will send their value
undefined says ??
undefined says hi
undefined says is there any way to send fund without paying by my account from dashboard
undefined says beacuse i want that people should pay
undefined says using batch
undefined says you don't wish to sponsor the gas fees right ?
undefined says in that case, you can skip the paymaster, make sure you have matic (test token) in your smart account
undefined says and no, if you have smart account, people won't pass the gas fees request to send theit transaction
every eoa has single scw and can be used by owner, so the implementation here is that if you dont want to sponsor other peopl'e gas fees, just don;t use paymaster. people can spin the scw on your dapp and pay for the cost
undefined says is there any docs for how can i use scw
undefined says hi there, I'm getting this error as well. Any resolutions on this?
undefined says @everyone zkSync launches token Airdrop for active community members.

undefined says what error are you facing @Killuaツ
undefined says this is the error i'm facing
undefined says here it is saying smart account has not fund
undefined says what i want is :
People give their deposit amount from dapp.
undefined says Hey might be some polyfill, can you run another example https://github.com/Rahat-ch/biconomy_nft_onboarding_demo
undefined says sure
undefined says Hey didnt get what you are saying
undefined says Hi I never received a response to this, anyone able to help?
undefined says i succesfully ran this, no errors
undefined says I mean we want to send transaction from my website using batch transaction. But I will not pay for calling gas fee or trasanction deposit amount (native amount for sending). Value will be deducted from users metamask
undefined says can you give any example docs code or repo. Where I can fund Smart Account
undefined says Will this https://github.com/bcnmy/scw-contracts/tree/feat-ownerless-passkey-module give us the ability to use passkeys for account generation?
undefined says if yes, will it be implemented this year?
undefined says is it safe to keep using `msg.sender` instead of `msgSender()` for functions that we dont want to be used with meta-txns?
undefined says how can I use biconomy smart wallet sdk with wagmi?
undefined says getting invalid provider while initiating the instance @Vanshika | Biconomy any help?
undefined says any help @here?
undefined says I have the same question
undefined says i'm integrating the aa sponsor call with particle
undefined says Hi @0xTiffany
undefined says whats your issue
undefined says yes.
undefined says in future!
undefined says basically you don't want gasless transactions right?
undefined says so you can simply use smart account, which users will fund on their own and then use for paying gas fees, instead of metamask, they will have scw paying the fees
undefined says Biconomy eoa sdk only accepts window.ethereum. which means i can only interact with it. With browser based wallet only

undefined says Hey there, I wanted to confirm that Biconomy gasless transactions are supported on the BSC mainnet. We did check the docs and Binance was listed there, but I wanted to confirm this once. 😄
undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy @Naman | Biconomy 
Hello , we wonder if we can have precise permission control for every txn that we will pay for ? or can we have any api or setting in dashboard ?

Currently we are testing the biconomy SDK , and we found out that it can only control for which contract we permit , and which function in the contract we allow .  But we can't control for which txn we allow , or which txn we will pay for . 

It's that possible to make such role permission control for gas control ? 😀 
Thanks !
undefined says I am confused about something. What's the difference between smartaccount and biconomy/mexa. And woth only smartaccount alone can make a batch gasless transfer. Without needing to install npm biconomy/mexa
undefined says I am having error with the smartaccount. It's showing failed estimating gas limit
undefined says No
undefined says Hi @Aniket what project are you working on?
undefined says This sounds like Business logic issue, please post more info.

Also, Smart Accounts & Mexa are different SDKs, if you want batched gasless transactions, you have to use smart accounts

undefined says yes this is not me, pls ignore the message, you can tag me in any query you might have here or on dm @OHIRA
undefined says We will keep you posted
undefined says Okay so smart account packages are different biconomy/mexa. biconomy/mexa works on eip 2771 model, mostly meta transactions and has limited functionality compared to smart accounts, so you dont need to install biconomy/mexa, you need to follow 
yarn add @biconomy/smart-account
// or
npm install @biconomy/smart-account
undefined says @chaikans directory by any chance are you trying to do transaction which needs to go through smart account but the asset is not there? whats the function you are trying?
undefined says The issue was. I didn't use the getfeequotesbatch and the populate function
undefined says I was not passing the function to the sendtransactionbatch
undefined says okay, is it resolved now or does it still persists, if yes can you share the code implementation ?
undefined says I will test it again to confirm if it doesn't go through i will send it
undefined says Thank you for responding

undefined says @Vanshika | Biconomy How can I withdraw token from my dashboard to an external wallet?
undefined says 
undefined says Can someone tell me how can i get a bundler url for mumbai testnet?
undefined says Hi, for the time being you can use this URL : 
https://bundler.biconomy.io/api/v2/ {enter chain id here} / nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44
undefined says Pls send your details to : 
about the withdrawal gas tank, as you are using the old sdk , kindly drop an email at support@biconomy.io and divya@biconomy.io - pls mention your credentials(email that you have used to login, wallet address used for transferring funds and dapp api key) and also the wallet address where you would like to receive funds
Api key
Dapp name
Wallet address 
Amount
undefined says Thanks 🙂
undefined says Who is the best person to connect with regarding partnerships?
undefined says Any ETA on the bundler when it will be available on the dashboard ?
undefined says soon! keep an eye out on #🖥｜tech-announcements
undefined says Can you help me? I have a example of code similar of https://docs.biconomy.io/docs/quickstart but base goerli network instead of mumbai
I got error in smartAccount.buildUserOp line code {
  code: -32508,
  message: 'call data execution failed with message: execution reverted'
}
undefined says hey, there could be multiple reasons for this error, one of them could be not having enough funds/token or check if the contract is payable or not. If it is not resolved yet, please share your source code through GitHub so that I can try running it locally to see what the issue is.
undefined says I have an NFT marketplace project with a feature that allows the backend (BE) to send transactions on behalf of the user. I wonder if I can use Biconomy SDK V2.0 to handle concurrent transactions sent from the backend. If yes, how can I achieve that?
undefined says is it not possible to withdraw remaining balance from gas tank?
undefined says Hello Biconomy team. I am having a bundled transaction that somebody can claim a 0.005 eth from a contract once, paymaster is added by biconomy and also I am executing UserOp there. But the eth from the contract is going to be received on the newly created smart wallet account. Is it possible to receive that eth to the EOA address instead?
undefined says hello team.
im following the tutorial to get started with bicnomy. I'm already stuck here "a bundler url which you can retrieve from the Biconomy Dashboard"
have registered and been looking around in the dashboard but i dont find a bundler API key.
undefined says oups nvm, the quick explorer says we can use the default api
undefined says was someone able to make the example with rainbow work ?
/sdk-examples/nextjs-rainbow
undefined says There is no Bundler api yet. As far as I know
undefined says Good day @Biconomy Team,

My question would be: what impact would a better/lower latency have on your business and how much value would it bring to your projects?

Looking forward to your feedback ! 
Thomas
undefined says @Rhic | Biconomy might help you better on this
undefined says Can you tell me how to use the default API?

I have code like:
```tsx
const paymaster: IPaymaster = new BiconomyPaymaster({
  paymasterUrl: CONFIG.paymasterURL,
});
const bundler: IBundler = new Bundler({
  bundlerUrl: '',
  chainId: ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET,
  entryPointAddress: DEFAULT_ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS,
});
const accountConfig: BiconomySmartAccountConfig = {
  signer: provider.getSigner(),
  chainId: ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET,
  paymaster,
  bundler,
};
const accountObject = new BiconomySmartAccount(accountConfig);
```
I'm having a hell of a time trying to figure out what to put for the `bundlerUrl`.

If I leave it out, I get an error. If I make it an empty string, I get an error. If I use `https://bundler.biconomy.io/api/v2/${ChainId.POLYGON_MAINNET}/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44`, I get an error that API key isn't for that chain. If I use `https://polygon.llamarpc.com`, I get an error.

What should I be using?
undefined says in the docs somewhere they say that for now you can use the default that they made available there
undefined says i had to look for it a bit. let me see if i can find it
undefined says in quickstart
undefined says const bundler: IBundler = new Bundler({
    bundlerUrl: 'https://bundler.biconomy.io/api/v2/80001/nJPK7B3ru.dd7f7861-190d-41bd-af80-6877f74b8f44',     
    chainId: ChainId.POLYGON_MUMBAI,
    entryPointAddress: DEFAULT_ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS,
  })
undefined says I'll try it, but I'm pretty sure that API key is only for Mumbai, not Polygon's mainnet.
undefined says ah yes, they menbtion to contact them for mainnet
undefined says Ok, I'll give that a shot. :blobthx:
undefined says https://docs.biconomy.io/docs/quickexplore/setupnodecli

undefined says https://dashboard-gasless.biconomy.io/

is this not working anymore though it shows that i have this contract in dashboard on dashboard but can;t make it work here it says

undefined says Hi , can someone tell me how Verifying Paymaster works . It takes the signature of another user but who pays for the transaction is what i want to know
undefined says export const logErrorMessage = (errorMessage: any) => {
  console.error(serializeError(errorMessage));
};


the error msg is from here in @biconomy/mexa/src/utils.js
undefined says hey all
we'd like to enable account abstraction smart wallets on Telegram without requiring any private key on the user's end
is this possible with Biconomy's social longs?
undefined says does gasless sdk not support arbitrum goerli? isnt arbitrum goerli the recommended testnet for Arbitrum?
undefined says @Rahat | Biconomy @Sruthi Manthena @Prestx00 | Biconomy any dev support for question please
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says hey @The Lightning Emperor 
make sure you are using the correct contract address, please recheck it once, if the error still shows up, share the full source code through a repo on github so that I can try running it locally
undefined says here is the list of supported networks for eoa gasless sdk: https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/misc/supported-networks
undefined says i saw this. it only says arbitrum testnet. and i understand this is rinkeby, not goerli
undefined says but goerli is the recommended according to arbitrum docs
undefined says @Reet | Biconomy i got error when call getAllTokenBalances with BASE_GOERLI_TESTNET chainId
undefined says the best option could be to go ahead with partical auth using biconomy's social login that will allow through phone number, email, facebook, twitter and more. Telegram isn't available yet but hopefully soon!
undefined says here i am sure i am passing the correct address which can be seen in the network request as well i have also share the console log of error and where it is coming from i can't share repo as it is a private repo
undefined says we are not live on BASE_GOERLI_TESTNET yet, I recommend using out new sdk v2 (https://bicodocs-yamx.vercel.app/docs/overview) we will add many new networks soon! I will keep you posted on this.
undefined says okay, let me recheck other possible solutions and get back to you
undefined says can i have a quick explanation of how it works?

let's say with Twitter. say i want to make a a user's tweet a trigger to a transaction, or something like that, how do i do that?
undefined says or anything else for that matter, how do i use the partical auth thing in order to verify their session's specific intent (i.e specific transaction that they want to trigger)
undefined says yes, unfortunately we are not live on that yet, I could recommend using our new sdk and update you when we add more networks.
undefined says When does the bunder have in mainet? I want to use it in my product.

undefined says any Updates , Thank you for the help
undefined says Hi! I setup a paymaster through this dashboard https://dashboard.biconomy.io/
and I think I set it up correctly in my code (refer to the image). But I am still getting `AA21 didn't pay prefund` error.

I have whitelisted the contract and funded the gas tank.

I am using `@biconomy/paymaster` 3.1.1-alpha.0 package (can't install older version)

What do you think did I miss?
undefined says When does the bunder have in mainet? I want to use it in my product.
The Bundler is stable enough for me to use in my product ???
undefined says Hello @lorenz_ov 
It seems that the error occurred due to insufficient funds to cover the transaction. To proceed with the transaction, try refunding the gas tank and ensuring that there are enough funds available. Once the gas tank is adequately funded, you can execute the transaction again.
Let me know if you need any further assistance.
undefined says @QuanNAAA 
The bundlers are on its way and you can test them at the links provided here for the Testnet.
https://dashboard.biconomy.io/bundlers

If you want to use the bundlers on the Mainnet reach out to @Rhic | Biconomy  for the URL.
undefined says hey there, i have been testing and playing around with the biconomy's AA stack. I wanted to know how can i whitelist smart accounts for a particular function on my smart contract. Is there a way to configure the bundler to only accept function calling from the particular smart account address? or how can i know from whom the function is being called through the bundler so that i can create a whitelist function in my contract instead.
undefined says Hey, i had a doubt regarding gas less txs, if my dapps contract is calling another contract through delegate call is it also necessary for that contract also to be 2771 compatible,
undefined says verifying paymaster is the sponsorship paymaster, which means that third party - sponsor who will cover the gas fees for user and the signature will be taken for the sponsor.
undefined says our new sdk is 4337 compatible.
undefined says What are the changes i need to to to my dapps contract for it to be compatible with AA gasless transactions ?
undefined says just try following this: https://bicodocs-yamx.vercel.app/docs/category/smart-accounts
undefined says you can setup the bundler from here https://dashboard.biconomy.io/bundlers
undefined says I read this , I'm still not clear  , do i need to make my contract 2771 compatible ie do i need to change msg.sender() to _msgSender()etc for smart contract account gasless transactions
undefined says i cant setup rules for it though, thats why i asked that question, how can i setup my contract or the sdk such that bundler only takes userop from the addresses i have whitelisted in the contract.
undefined says In simple terms, how can my contract know which smart account has created a userop and called the function, since the msg.sender will be the bundler's address and not the smart account one's
undefined says @Reet | Biconomy 
so continuation to that how can i send code with github gist on dm or something else
and i am getting this issue from here i have checked the contract address that i am sending and it is correct please help

 const api = this.dappApiMap[`${to}-${methodName}`];
        // Information we get here is contractAddress, methodName, methodType, ApiId
        let customBatchId;
        let customDomainName;
        let customDomainVersion;

undefined says @NicoDeva Hey, try reporting here please
undefined says Hi, pb that happened:
- calling extractReward(NFTid, to) on a staked NFT position on Avax succeeds, but returns no rewards
- frontend still display same amount of rewards pending, calling it again returns  no AVAX
- after that trying to remove the NFT from the farm will return a frontend error, trying to call directyl from the contract on snowtrace will show and error ERR__UNPAID_REWARDS_EXIST

Right now the NFT cannot receive rewards and cannot be withdrawn.
Funds are effectively locked

undefined says I have funded paymaster up to 0.7 MATIC and tried again, still returning `AA21 didn't pay prefund`. I am only calling an `increment()` function from a basic `Counter.sol` which increment a stored number by 1. I think I have more than enough MATIC to cover the cost right?
undefined says hi
there is the problem in hyphen with farming positions in avalanche again.
the same problem was about three months ago.
we can't claim rewards and withdraw liquidity.
undefined says can someone answer this simple question?
undefined says which package are you on?
undefined says @Rhic | Biconomy can help you with that, please raise a ticket in #hyphen-support
undefined says Hi @Reet | Biconomy , can you tell me how biconomy is implementing Paymaster policies ? Is it being done on the backend side , if yes then how are you able to only authorize certain functions to accees the paymaster.

undefined says is this a bridge tx or a deposit to a liquidity pool? if the later one how can i withdraw?
undefined says thanks for the reply, I figured out the answer, any ETA for bundler to launch on mainnet? My team would require access to it soon for its project, I messaged Rhic for the access but didn't reply either.
undefined says Good morning, we have a backend with the package biconomy/mexa version 2.0.35 which sends the signed transactions to the API /api/v2/meta-tx/native
The contracts we have use the EIP 2771 standard.
https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771

One method of our contract sends a fee of a token ERC20 to an account and the rest to an end user.

We have a case where the user made a transfer to the Biconomy API and it was the other way around, without using the forwarder in the first instance. The two transactions that occurred are:
https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xf56dfabda7390435480a33c8b0b7869785fb235461efa1b2b105e9a5e5bc2989

We have made several transactions not for that value and they were successful.I appreciate your help.
undefined says i will ask him to reply asap @Rhic | Biconomy could you pls check this
undefined says good to hear, do you have any questions
undefined says We need to know what happened since we consider that the problem was in your API

undefined says Hi Team Biconomy... Can I make recurring/automated transactions via Biconomy's AA service?
undefined says @Nepel check your dm
undefined says @here For some reason our registered contract `0xb9acf5287881160e8ce66b53b507f6350d7a7b1b` in biconomy dashboard of matic mainnet is giving 
```Result {
    "success": false,
    "code": 507,
    "message": "Network with id 137 is not supported",
    "responseCode": 409
}
```
on hitting the `https://api.biconomy.io/api/v2/meta-tx/native` 
Getting this error even if the contract address is registered
undefined says @here at same time `${helperAttributes.baseURL}/api/v2/meta-tx/systemInfo?networkId=${networkId}` this api is giving forwarder address as undefined. So when the address is undefined we are sending default address as 0x86C80a8aa58e0A4fa09A69624c31Ab2a6CAD56b8.
undefined says The forwarder address is coming undefined on biconomy open api `/api/v2/meta-tx/systemInfo?networkId=${networkId}`
undefined says @Yash  can you help me with this.

undefined says Hey folks, is there an estimated release date for the V2 SCW?
undefined says hi, I'm seeing issues with the biconomy web3-auth modal , are these the correct dependencies to use? ```     "@biconomy/account": "^3.1.1-alpha.0",

    "@biconomy/common": "^3.1.1-alpha.0",

    "@biconomy/paymaster": "^3.1.1-alpha.0",
    "@biconomy/web3-auth": "^3.0.0-alpha.0", ``` I also noticed biconomy sdk is using an old version of ethers, is there work being done to upgrade to the latest version of ethers?
undefined says Can I still use SDK V1 for relayer transactions from the backend? Because the bundler in SDK V2 is not yet complete
undefined says Hello friends 👋 
How can i debug a 400 error triggered by `await smartAccount.buildUserOp([tx])` ? I get a "call data execution failed with message: execution reverted" but it is pretty opaque as a message 🤷‍♂️ 
Anyone ?

undefined says what do you mean by node error? do you mean javascript error?
undefined says when i search about the error, it appears to be web3auth problem, from the first result at least.
undefined says no screen unfortunaltely on on console, since it does not appear on dev/localhost and only does when i deployed it using vercel

undefined says guys i think i probably found a relaled error to this problem. Somehow it ask to whitelist the url on the client id that is shown in this log. But since i use biconomy sdk i cant whitelist it on my own, since i am using bicomy's client id? Do we have to supply our own client id when using the `@biconomy/web3-auth` package?

undefined says I am using WMATIC on polygon mumbai for gas payments
undefined says Resolved this issue. The issue was with the contract execution
undefined says Hi guys I'm having real trouble getting started with smart accounts and the SDK for social login. None of the starters seem to work for me and I can't work out why:

Nader's tutorial
https://github.com/dabit3/biconomy-social-auth
Error: 
```
error setting up smart account...  TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getAddressForCounterfactualWallet')
    at SmartAccount.getAddress (SmartAccount.js:686:1)

```

SDK Example
https://sdk-staging.biconomy.io/

NextJS SDK Examples:

```
undefined says Can someone please share some additional guidance as to what I'm doing wrong here? Or if there is some sort of initialization I'm misconfiguring
undefined says Same error with the react starter `Invalid Smart Wallet contract address`
undefined says I'm guessing there's some additional config I forgot to do before being able to use a smart account? But if so I am really struggling to see where in the docs
undefined says If anyone could help I'd really appreciate
undefined says Interestingly @Vanshika | Biconomy your demo repo is working nicely!
undefined says Do you think you could help me try and work through why it isn't working so we could update the other examples? I really like the product but I'm a bit nervous as the docs and examples all seem to point to different versions of the SDK and I'm unsure how stable everything is?
undefined says I'm just comparing the package.jsons (code is now the same):

Mine:
```json
    "@biconomy/core-types": "3.1.2-alpha.0",
    "@biconomy/smart-account": "^2.0.2",
    "@biconomy/web3-auth": "3.0.1-alpha.0",
```
Yours:
```json
    "@biconomy/core-types": "2.0.0",
    "@biconomy/relayer": "2.0.0",
    "@biconomy/smart-account": "2.0.0",
    "@biconomy/transactions": "2.0.0",
    "@biconomy/web3-auth": "^2.0.0",

undefined says I'm trying to do a swap on uniswap using smart wallet. I was able to send the approve tx, but am receiving an error when trying to execute swap, the error I get is:

```
error received  {
  code: -32508,
  message: 'Transaction reverted in simulation with reason: userOp execution failed. Use handleOpsCallData to simulate transaction to check transaction execution steps'

```

I'm not sure how to use `handleOpsCallData`, searching the docs doesn't return any results, `BiconomySmartAccount` object doesn't seem to contain this method
undefined says Does this repository work for anyone?

undefined says Hi, how can i read the error message returned from my smart contract in the receipt? I use the revert synthax in my smart contract to throw errors
undefined says @Sopi is trying to scam here, @Moderator please step up
undefined says Yes i think too
undefined says Anyone know how read the reverted message from my smart contract from the sdk?
undefined says I have just integrated the bichonomy mexa gasless updates in my smart contract and now working on the backend to integrate the SDK.
I wanted to send batch transactions to the relayer.

As a starting point there are two transactions.
1. Signed by a user wallet and interacting with the smart contract method 1
2. Signed by a owner wallet and interacting with the smart contract method 2

I wanted to have this executed in the same relayer transaction.
Is this directly possible or is there a workaround for this ?
Thanks

undefined says having a consistent error when running `yarn run smartAccount transfer --to=0x322Af0da66D00be980C7aa006377FCaaEee3BDFD --amount=0.001` to transfer native tokens. it looks like this `code: -32508, message: 'Transaction reverted in simulation with reason: userOp execution failed. Use handleOpsCallData to simulate transaction to check transaction execution steps`. any thoughts on what the issue could be? thanks yall
undefined says yeah it worked later in the day 

i think biconomy takes 2 3 hours just to get started with the dashboard
undefined says bro😢 it worked later in the day no need for support now
undefined says help pretty please?
undefined says anyone knows why am I getting the following error?
undefined says when trying to use the transferFrom method in my contract. When minting it works fine and I approve the trustedForwarder to be able to later transfer I guess.

undefined says i created a cutom hook for connecting with socialLogin and then i set a state of the provider and socialLoginSDK, this wokrs, but if i refresh the page i loose the state, i do no think saving in  the localstorage is  a safe place, any suggest?
undefined says Do you know if is possible verify  the idToken returned from  sociallogin.getUserInfo() in a backend system? i would like to send custom token after that user is logged with social login using the email selected during the login
undefined says scam @SilvaDOt ?
undefined says no
undefined says when you login store user credentials in localstorage(example name, wallet address). when you refresh the page you check if there is user in localstorage then you run the function of social-Login and create smartAccount function. This will reload your biconomy smartAccount. I think you understand what i want to say.🙂
undefined says his not \
undefined says I also solve this issue today😅
undefined says That great...👍
undefined says thank you, so you run agian smartAccount.init()? I programatically execute the google login whit this await socialLogin?.socialLogin("google"), but there is the possibility that it return wallet alrady connected error, so i do not think that wallet etc is enough to check, because the google auth loign also could expire, right?
undefined says i again run the socialSDK.init()
undefined says i run this function at the time of reloading.
undefined says ok thank i will try
undefined says 👍
undefined says Okay. If any issue let me know

undefined says Is AA  secure? I think it's insecure because I can get  anyone private key on my platform. Whats everyone think? Is it secure or not ?
undefined says [#Create-a-new -ticket](http://discord.gg/Mrw43TYDzb)
undefined says the links on this page need to be updated:
https://docs.biconomy.io/docs/audits
undefined says I have the same doubts
undefined says that is not true, AA does not require you to share your private key with anyone. you need to sign UserOperations with your private key, that is about it. You can also replace the private key with any kind of a signature verification logic.
undefined says Hi all, newbie here I am testing out the features of AA. From each `handleOps` , can the `ops.callData ` be verify that is signed by actual  `ops.sender` using the `ops.signature` and `ops.nonce`.?
undefined says @kavorka When you create the account. Web3auth returns the private key of your social login which is the owner of your smart account. So when I get the private key of any social login user, I can take over their smart wallet. Please clear my doubts if i am wrong.
undefined says Dear Team,

I'm sorry, i found domain takeover vulnerability at biconomy.io , how to reach this issue to security team there?
undefined says If i use web3Auth to get the EOA, i canaccess the privateKey, no?
undefined says yes thats my question if we get the private key of owner we can access to the smart wallet.
undefined says @Reet | Biconomy
undefined says The dapp authentication is separate from what AA needs. in Web3Auth the private key is distributed / broken up as far as I know.
undefined says just dont use the Web3Auth

undefined says Hey guys! I am using the hyphen bridging sdk in my app. And whenever I try send matic tokens to eth goerli, the preTransferStatus gives an ok code but when i call the deposit function, it says not enough gas. I have around 1.7 matic and want to transfer 0.1 matic but still its giving an error. Any help would be appreciated. If you want I can share the code as well. Thanks
undefined says Sure. Thanks guys

undefined says can a user access the smart account that is set up for them or do I have to transfer it to their particle wallet for them to have ownership of it / or add a transfer function button for them?
undefined says for example, the smart account mints an nft, does the nft then need to be transferred to their particle or metamask wallet for them to have control of the nft
undefined says hey guys. trying to use the sdk but i keep getting the 'AA21 didn't pay prefund' error. gas tank is funded up to 0.51 matic and the contract address is whitelisted. any thoughts?
undefined says I am experimenting with the quickstart, and want to calculate the contractual address based on an account index. 

when I do so, the address that I get back is always the one for account index 0. here is the bit of code I modified in the quick start (the command line version)

```js
async function createAccount() {
    let biconomySmartAccount = new BiconomySmartAccount(
        biconomySmartAccountConfig
    );
    const initData: InitilizationData = {
        accountIndex: 100,
        signerAddress:  wallet.address,
    };

    biconomySmartAccount = await biconomySmartAccount.init(initData);
    address = await biconomySmartAccount.getSmartAccountAddress();
    console.log(address);
    smartAccount = biconomySmartAccount;
    return biconomySmartAccount;
}
```
undefined says nvm, I figured out the problem, I had to pass the accountIndex back into the getSmartAccountAddress call:

```js
 address = await biconomySmartAccount.getSmartAccountAddress(initData.accountIndex);
```
undefined says for starters you could use there node.js back end example. it does not use the social login. granted you supply ur passkey so its not like its a consumer based approach. but im pretty sure that all you need to do is supply the signer to construct a wallet. now it gets a little messy here because wagmi is going to the viem approach and are using walletClients. idk try to use the `const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)
const signer = provider.getSigner() `
to get the signer. and to be completely honest in my development process, i have been using a combination of sdks to get the results that i have desired including my own wallet implementation and havent gotten to the point where im even using a front end. The use of the AA is kinda hard to comprehend and is not how we normally interact with an EVM. so through my frustration i had to deconstruct everything down to the simplest form and build from there. like using the userop.js library so that you understand the what is really going on before moving into what biconomy has created.  that may help a bit. here is also something that really helped me grasp some of these concepts https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-entire-aa-wallet-from-scratch/
undefined says you have to design the logic to do what you want to do with that NFT by yourself and encode it, then send it to the bundler. to interact with it. it can stay in the smartAccount u just need to create the bytecode that does want you want to do with it, including transferring to an eoa wallet.
undefined says I did the same, get the signer and passed to sdk, so that it can calc the address.
undefined says Can anyone help me with this ?
undefined says Hello folks, can anyone help me with this issue ?
I am trying to do a transaction with WMATIC for gas and I am constantly getting this error..

Still got no resolution on this
undefined says hello?
undefined says check your tx on tenderly and see whats going on. the thing it is referring to is a function that simulates the tx and it is located on the entry point contract. i dont know how to call it tho lol
undefined says The issue is fixed. I had to add this parameter `calculateGasLimits: true` in the `paymasterServiceData` object.

After that, add the new gasLimits values into the final userOp.
It works now
undefined says yup makes sense. the gass calculation are really nice
undefined says Hey guys.
I am starting on the AA SDK and I read - 
```
Smart accounts are counterfactual in nature. We know their address before they are even deployed. In this instance we won’t immediately deploy it, it will automatically be deployed on the first transaction it initiates and the gas needed for deployment will be added to that first transaction.
```
Is there a way to deploy these smart accounts like a method ?
I would love to know as I want to deploy these accounts first and then initiate some transactions.
undefined says you don need to deploy first, wth AA, your account is deployed when you make your first tx.Thats why is "counterfactual".When you make the first tx, try to check on the scan the address, and you will see that will be market as contract and not as address
undefined says what error are you getting?
undefined says please DM @Rhic | Biconomy

But getForwardRequestAndMessageToSign is not found. I'm using  "@biconomy/mexa": "^3.0.4". What should I do?

Ethers + EIP712Sign

              data: functionSignature,

// should get user message to sign for EIP712 or personal signature types
const forwardData = await biconomy.getForwardRequestAndMessageToSign(signedTx);
console.log(forwardData);      

// optionally one can sign using sigUtil
const signature = sigUtil.signTypedMessage(new Buffer.from(privateKey, 'hex'), { data: forwardData.eip712Format }, 'V3');                                                                    

let data = {
    signature: signature,
    forwardRequest: forwardData.request,
    rawTransaction: signedTx,
    signatureType: biconomy.EIP712_SIGN
};

let provider = biconomy.getEthersProvider();
// send signed transaction with ethers
// promise resolves to transaction hash                  
let txHash = await provider.send("eth_sendRawTransaction", [data]);

let receipt = await provider.waitForTransaction(txHash);
//do something
