undefined says Arbitrum Nova is a chain that provides ultra low-cost transactions with strong security guarantees that operate alongside Arbitrum One, with the main use-cases include social applications and gaming!

Arbitrum Nova is operated by a committee of nodes, with a minimal assumption about how many committee members are honest.

Read more about Nova's tech here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/AnyTrust

Arbitrum One is the optimistic rollup that comes fully built out with fraud proofs that is home to the biggest defi and crypto-native projects today.

undefined says Hey! I just rebuilt my L1 node, and now when I try to connect metamask to my Arbitrum node I'm getting this:
`Served eth_call conn=192.168.1.5:62162 reqid=6ac0dc7f-0ef5-411b-8575-ae08510206f3 duration=1.384614ms  err="missing trie node 879192705e97f9113a3f13e529bc16cdc4690b8bc82266a0f4221212c0648d0a (path ) <nil>"`
Any ideas on what's going on?

On second thought, it looks like I'm just still syncing. Will revisit if that turns out not to be the case.

undefined says What is the expected size of an archive nitro node? My folder is at ~720 GB,s that expected?
undefined says GOOD
undefined says Nice
undefined says I guess it is. The current size for our full nitro archive node is ~699GB
undefined says nice
undefined says how to run a node?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Is there an application form to fill before running a node
undefined says And is the node running on tesnet or mainnet?
undefined says What's the default amount of blocks I can query from a full node vs archive node?
undefined says BTW this automod is insanely strict
undefined says Hey
Could somebody help me?
I ran arbitrum one mainnet and goeli node.
It is possible to connect to the node via HTTP, but it is not possible to connect via WS, although port 8548 is open to the world.
Perhaps I need to write docker startup flags?
My docker run line looks like:
```
docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.8-5b9fe9c --l1.url https://x.x.x.x:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```
undefined says im interested in running a node, is there going to be a way we can actually register the node we are running for a potential role or or some sort of recognition? Ill be running a node either way just wanted to ask
undefined says Hey! We don't have such a program.
undefined says hey, how easy is it to get multiple txs included in a single (L2) block? (assuming I'm running my own node for example)
undefined says Node runner will be incentivezed
?
undefined says nope!
undefined says Nope
undefined says Node
undefined says i want to be arbitrum validator 🥲
undefined says nice:arbitrum:
undefined says Nope
undefined says My node was active for about 1 month. I have 400gb of storage on my server and I get the error "no space left on device". How much storage space will I need?
undefined says is
undefined says What are the requirements to run a node?
undefined says It's same as geth
undefined says The archival nitro node is ~699GB rn
undefined says -
undefined says where can I find the server requirements?
undefined says The requirements are same as geth (https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/ethereum-clients/geth/)
undefined says I'm running node with `--init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar` flag. Once the node is synced, can I restart the node and remove this flag? Or it's required to always be defined?
undefined says remove the flag, otherwise your syncing starts from the beginning
undefined says I've done that mistake like... five times
undefined says I wish arbitrum added a check for that though. So if the node has synced blocks, it would automatically ignore the --init flag
undefined says @paulius @tappokone | GarageNodes We do mention the --init flag should be only used during the initialization in our docs:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#required-artifacts
`Use the parameter --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" on first startup to initialize Nitro databas`e
undefined says Yeah and also it is common sense. Still I did the mistake more than once 😄
undefined says But infact it seems that the example code has been updated and the init removed from it
undefined says This is a good solution
undefined says Nice to see that feedback has not gone unnoticed 🙂
undefined says Of course! :arbiblobblue:
undefined says BTW just checked with the team on this and found that our nitro-node already ignores the init flag if already initialized. 
If it is re-downloading, possibly corrupt database. That's why you have to make sure you are gracefully shutting down and also verify that database is being created inside persistent volume.
undefined says Also please make sure you are not using any parameters that are not listed on the website (e.g., --init.force)
undefined says Oh, interesting. Thanks for the info! Is there a way to improve robustness? I mean every time there is a slighest hiccup with the server, the syncinc starts from the beginning
undefined says Of course! I'll deliver this feedback to our team 🙂
undefined says I know nothing about the code side of the nodes but maybe some checkpoint systems
undefined says How do I get roles please
undefined says Please ask this in the #📬︱support
undefined says How can I set up a validator node on Arbitrum Nova network? Is it possible?
undefined says The ability to post assertions on-chain for mainnet Arbitrum chains is whitelisted. However, you can run a validator in `Watchtower` mode which will immediately log an error if an on-chain assertion deviates from the locally computed chain state
undefined says My NUC has 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD
undefined says So it is not possible for me? I want to create a dapp on the nova network, how should I do it? Do I need a validator node?
undefined says You don't have to run a validator to be able to create a Dapp on any of our networks. Deploying contracts on our chains is similar to how you'd do it on Ethereum
undefined says Here is a script in our tutorials that shows how to deploy a contract on Arb:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/demo-dapp-pet-shop
undefined says Hey Masha, I am running Ethereum (Prysm/Nethermind) validators and wanting to operate Arbitrum nodes on the same machine. 

Is this possible? And is there info of the rewards for doing so?
My NUC has 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD
undefined says Does this help me to build a dapp?
undefined says Please reach out to our partnerships, they might be able to help you better: `partnerships@gmail.com`
(and no, we dont provide rewards. Running a validator helps to to participate in the ecosystem. Obviously you'll win some rewards if there is ever a dispute in which you win)
undefined says Yes!
undefined says thank you
undefined says I want to run Arbitrum Nitrol Rollups against Cronos EVM (L1).
May I know if there are any specific steps to do while running both networks.

Also, can someone confirm what `chain-id` I need to mention while running the Nitro node from docker?
undefined says `Fatal configuration error: Unknown chain with L1: 338, L2: 400.  Change L1, update L2 chain id, or provide --persistent.chain`
undefined says We currently don’t have any docs about deploying arbitrum on a new chain, but our source code is here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro
undefined says You can’t run a node and connect to a new l1 directly, you should deploy all of the arbitrum’s contract on that l1 also.
undefined says How to deploy all smart contracts on L1?

I mean where can I find all the requisite smart contracts?
undefined says I understand the type of license provides non-production uses so forking it would not help us I think.
undefined says You can find then on that repo’s contracts dir
undefined says How much ram and sdd need to run node
undefined says same as geth, but if running validator; you should prepare more than 64gb
undefined says Hello! Are there any requirements for node-runners?
undefined says same as geth
undefined says hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs , sent you a DM if you could please check it once you have some spare time
undefined says Is there any rewards for running validator node ?
undefined says No, we dont provide rewards. Obviously you'll win some rewards if there is ever a dispute in which you win
undefined says Thank you !
undefined says Can you tell me how I can speed up the synchronization? I installed the node, it goes very slowly, it seems to me that this is abnormal. In a nearby thread, they said it could be related to CPU or L1 RPC. I specified Alchemy for L1, is this a bad option? What can be done at all?
undefined says Maybe somewhere I can download the full blockchain?
undefined says Great
undefined says Hey, as I said the sync speed depends on your L1 connection speed (we have a list of node providers here that you coul check : https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/node-providers) and your CPU speed
undefined says Just a general question about node.  So are all validator nodes on eth are also rpc nodes as well ? Or they are two different kinds ?  Appreciate!
undefined says There are three types of validators on Arb: 
1) The active validator
2) The defensive validator
3) The watchtower validator

You could learn about their differences here:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#validators
undefined says Thanks !
undefined says Do I need to worry about unindexed transactions log?
undefined says xin chào care nhà
undefined says can we run full node on windows?
undefined says Interestingly... Is your computer always on?
undefined says yes
undefined says Can you tell me if there is a guide on how to install an Arbitrum node?
undefined says Hey, here's a guide in our docs:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says is the arbi knot pruned
undefined says Is pruning mode active?
undefined says are nodes incentivised?
undefined says min hardware requirement for node running?
undefined says same as geth node (https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/ethereum-clients/geth/)
undefined says guild is so hard 😦
undefined says halo
undefined says What server do you recommend to run node on this network? Hardware specifications
Thanks 🍏

```
undefined says anyone know what's going on? @Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says I observe that the full node data file grows 50G a week
Is there a prune command?
undefined says Can i ask hardware requirements for node running ?
undefined says Do I need to be somewhat fluent in programming to run a node? I have the hardware, I have the bandwidth, but I do not really know how to program or have ever ran any nodes before. 
Is there a Node running for dummies guide?

Most guides are obviously written by programmers with a complete lack of ability to understand how to explain things in simple terms.
undefined says I want to run the nitro node on top of the custom EVM chain, which is Cronos EVM chain.

The docker container gives me connection refuse error even after changing to `--network host` mode !
Also, 
May I know the steps required to successfully run Arbitrum L2 chain on top of Cronos EVM chain?
undefined says Hey, please try to run v2.0.8 and see how that goes (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.8)
undefined says Hey we provide a guide for this in our docs:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Hey! Running the nitro nitro node on any other production environment is against our terms of service so we cannot help!
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/LICENSE
undefined says we dont provide any rewards for that 🙂
undefined says hey can I prune my node
undefined says or can I
undefined says I am only trying to test the feasability of Arbitrum L2 for our chain !
There would be an official communication once we find Arbitrum L2 as a solution to go live with.
undefined says how do I learn to run a node, anyone has a youtube video?

undefined says Oooh my bad
undefined says thanks anyway
undefined says just need to become a pro here too
undefined says thx a lot
undefined says anyone?
undefined says Guys, does it mean that my node will never participate in consensus and earn rewards?

undefined says how to run a node？
undefined says still trying to get nitro to connect to my local geth  node running on windows.  tried adding --network=host, but this doesn't seem to help.  has anyone run into this?
undefined says it says 'unindexed transactions' in the blocks in between, is this normal?
undefined says ok
undefined says asdasd'
undefined says Yes,
I have tried running but running into a connection refused error!
The moment I change to remote URLs work fine.
undefined says Is there an image into offchainlabs/nitro-node   (version 2.0.8-5b9fe9c) repository ?
undefined says What's the recommended way to run by manual building from the source code?
undefined says 
undefined says tag does not exist: offchainlabs/nitro-node:latest 
How can I push the repository offchainlabs/nitro-node to have the docker image please ?
undefined says i have this issue too
undefined says didn't have it at first and then at some point it started happening and it isn't going away
undefined says not sure what to do with it
undefined says does this have to do with the system tx? It's always 1 tx in a block that is unindexed
undefined says I guess it's not a bug or a problem
undefined says nah but it is very annoying xD
undefined says because the node is working and I can trade in the arbitrum network
undefined says yeah
undefined says So nobody can help noobs in "node univers" ? 😄
undefined says Possible to use Nitro in WSL2 Ubuntu ?
undefined says I pull the image , 
Create my container and download nitro database .tar
undefined says now, can i run node for arbitrum? where is guide run node? ad
undefined says Here for the doc : 
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says On my side, I ve got some difficult to initiate nitro database or directly for the  first step install and used nitro if needed
undefined says it's mean, now still run node
undefined says okay
undefined says @HidduhK @meta_root Nitro is deprecated (retired) , 
Do you know other solution ?
undefined says Nitro deprecated? They just released a newer version (v2.0.8)
undefined says you can use a snapshot
undefined says join https://t.me/arbitrumnodeupgrade for dev announcements
undefined says Yes I see it in the documentation, 
But It is not explain where add this parameter: 
--init.url=
undefined says just after the docker compose command
undefined says Please. I had to bridge my Ethereum on mainnet to Arbitrum Nova as part of requirements for an air drop.

The next step would be to move the Arbitrum nova to Arbitrum one on orbiter.finance and It wouldn't even respond. Maybe there is an amount necessary that i don't have.

Now I am trying to switch back my Arbitrum nova back to mainnet and I also can't

Please, I have had my funds stuck for a long time. Any help would be duly appreciated.

Thanks in anticipation
undefined says Thank you
undefined says @HidduhK  Need .yml file ?
undefined says that is easiest, yes
undefined says not required
undefined says Please anyone who can help me, please help me🤲. I really need your help
undefined says is it possible to put a year or late?
undefined says Do you mean for my query sir?
undefined says Yeah but how can we get it to work locally
undefined says This discord needs some mods lol
undefined says l wonder while l run a node lf l lost my internet connection, does computer download new blocks when l reconnect to internet?
undefined says or do i have to run a new code to download newly released blocks?
undefined says and l have one question more. How can l learn rpc address of my run node to use on my metamask wallet?
undefined says Actually !
undefined says Ser, did you get the answer?
undefined says The Nitro archival node is around 700GB with 14GB growth rate per day
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs Sir, l have some questions two row up? May you give answer for these?
undefined says also mine
undefined says If you mean running the nitro node locally here's the instruction:
Clone the nitro repo (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro). Then run `git submodule update --init --recursive `
Install docker and then run `./test-node.bash --init`
undefined says sorry - im referring to the --l1.url connecting to a local geth node
undefined says it doesn't seem to work on windows even with the --network=host option enabled
undefined says 1) Yes once reconnected your node will continue syncing data and downloading the missing blocks.
2) Running the node will give you L1 and L2 test RPCs:
L1 RPC:"http://localhost:8545"
L2 RPC:"http://localhost:8547"
undefined says Thanks. l have wanted to ask since the electricity is often cut off where I am.
undefined says Ty!
undefined says like
undefined says What is the minimum configuration to be able to run node arbitrum?
undefined says how can i stop and delete node arbitrum running on my device i did not find in the tutorial
undefined says ready goerli in large or small quantities
undefined says i also need to run a node
undefined says role
undefined says has anyone experienced this issue running an Arb node:
`INFO [12-01|13:41:48.161] Unindexed transactions                   blocks=1     txs=1     tail=2,092,849 elapsed="276.814µs"`
undefined says my block watching has slowed significantly
undefined says role
undefined says I believe 2 docker container both using host network cannot communicate with each other directly, they should instead connect by the container name (assuming in the same docker network) or remap the port to host and use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost`
Also the `localhost` inside the container would be the container itself instead of the host
undefined says This would be similar to stopping any other node
I'd gracefully shutdown the node
undefined says It'd be same as Geth
undefined says i've got my nitro in docker, is there a way to not run it in docker?  my geth is not in docker and the nitro can't seem to connect to it
undefined says then you can simply connect the nitro node to l1rpc host.docker.internal:8545
undefined says is node possible with windows?
undefined says So you can only use docker for a fullnode?  Is that right or just preferred.  Not the end of the world either way
undefined says have a nice day guys
undefined says When can we expected an Arbitrum Nitro package on DappNode?
undefined says Where can I get info on how to set up the Arbitrum node?
undefined says getting a lot of 'unindexed transactions' logs in my own node, is this normal? should I worry about it? never seen these before
undefined says did you figure it out?
undefined says no
undefined says Nope … my node is down now. Won’t even block watch. I’m filing a support ticket today
undefined says with 8 cores, 16gb ram and 500gb storage am i good for running a nitro node?
undefined says wow really launching node is available?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Regarding how to run node, I just posted the info above
undefined says hey
undefined says !role
undefined says guys how can i check my node is sync or not?
undefined says Hey guy, it's okay? I have connected to my IP node server successfully
undefined says can we set up an arbitrary node
undefined says Is it success?
undefined says yes
undefined says thanks
undefined says 👍
undefined says 
undefined says Where does the `nitro.tar` get saved on first install? Currently setting up a node and am required to download again on second try
undefined says (I had to kill abruptly the first time though, not sure if that impacts anything)
undefined says Seems to also get stuck on the `extracting downloaded init archive` step sometimes, running on Ubuntu
undefined says Can run nodes now ?
undefined says If you start your node using docker, you can see it on your host’s mount point.
undefined says ✅👍
undefined says Do we have any option to prune the Arbitrum RPC node?

I don't see any flags regarding pruning in the official docker image.
I did try restarting the node, which didn't seem to make any difference.

Any help is appreciated, Thanks 🙏
undefined says Did you happen to figure a solution for this?
undefined says I'd like to know aswell.
The current client behaviour isn't very predictable
undefined says It usually grew in size pretty slowly but I guess in the last month or so it went up in size a lot and I exhausted the disk space
undefined says It reached over 500GB on my node..
undefined says I had to restore a backup from roughly 1 month ago, which was 200GB, and I'm now resyncing. It's missing less than a week and I'm at only 225GB
undefined says A 280GB difference...
undefined says There are any docs for how to run docker-compose in nitro repo?
undefined says How about trying restart the node?
undefined says This depends on the network’s congestion, ethereum has fixed max block size and almost the block size on ethereum network is same, so it is predictable, but arbitrum’s network usage is increasing or it hard to predict it
undefined says You can use docker way to run the node: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node, any reasons to use docker-compose?
undefined says metamask
undefined says you're wasting your time with the installation and maintenance of node, you're wasting time. I installed this last year and last year more than 10 nodes and I gained 0 arp as a reward. Really you are going to waste your time with this L2
undefined says Anyone know how to fix could not fetch chain id when trying to connect to the rpc url?
undefined says Yea what block chain are you dealing with and what wallet ?
undefined says Troubleshoot it key, and make sure the URL is properly formatted with the correct protocol (either http or https).
undefined says can someone help.. why i get error when i try to init downloaded db? attempt 1 failed: Head "~/arbdb/nitro.tar": unsupported protocol scheme ""
--init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar" is the flag 
i had running previous docker image and wanted to switch to the newest i got 1 million problems..
undefined says also got this when i successfully downloaded the nitro.tar from url
undefined says It seems like you're trying to initialize a database from a downloaded file and facing an error due to an incorrect file path. Let's try to resolve the issue.

Based on the error message, it appears that the file path provided for the --init.url flag is incorrect. When using a local file path with the file:// protocol, you must provide the absolute path to the file.

Here's what you should do:

Ensure that the file nitro.tar is present in the correct location.
Replace the placeholder /path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar with the actual absolute path of the file nitro.tar on your system.
For example, if nitro.tar is located at /home/username/arbdb/nitro.tar, the flag should be:
undefined says --init.url="file:///home/username/arbdb/nitro.tar"
undefined says If you're using a Windows system, the path would look like:

--init.url="file:///C:/Users/username/arbdb/nitro.tar"
undefined says Make sure to replace "username" with your actual username on your system.

After updating the file path in the flag, try running the command again.
undefined says @kingot
undefined says Arbitrum one and metamask
undefined says so any mods here? is the server hacked? whats going on im so confused -_-
undefined says i can not understand this.. the file is in the location but it won't find it..
undefined says Are you having issues with the airdrop
undefined says Oh same and I used trust walker to claim mine.. what’s the issue you’re having right now or have you gotten it fixed ?
undefined says Nah I claimed mine a while ago, but I cannot connect to my node through the rpc on metamask, just says cannot fetch chain id even when it was synced
undefined says Ooh snap!! what wallet do you use?
undefined says metamask
undefined says I'm pretty sure the node is synced because the blocks are caught up to the current one
undefined says How long have you been having this issue?
undefined says @Minipa
undefined says Basically had it since the node synced
undefined says hasn't found a way to fix yet
undefined says Beware of scammers
undefined says Contact support for help
undefined says @Minipa
undefined says I have a question
do somebody have instruction to set up a node for arbitrum ? thanks

do somebody have instruction to set up a node for arbitrum ? thanks
undefined says do you know if the validators have any service to directly send transactions without going through the mempool? My account has a sweeper bot connected and I would like to send a ETH send transaction to the infected account and two other ransom transactions to get back my NFTs all in the same block... do you offer that service?
undefined says I did not get an airdrop, although I was only using the Arbitrum network since I knew its features and I have been using it, but now everyone has received a reward and I do not wish that you would send me the same

Also, it might be better to run `make docker`
undefined says Thanks a lot! updating the submodules did the trick!
undefined says Ok
undefined says 🥰🥰🥰
undefined says how to change the RPC port? The default is 8547 right
undefined says im in the docker container, im trying to find the `help `command, looking for a list of cli options
undefined says alright found it, its `nitro --help`
undefined says this can be run inside the docker container like so 
`docker exec -it <container> sh`
undefined says anyone on this?
undefined says did you figure out how to connect rpc on metamask
undefined says ok i have been researching how to run the new docker image and i have errors here.. i don't know why this channels exists if noone is helping...
undefined says Hey guys, I have a question about running a node:

I’m using the docker instructions and I was able to get it bootstrapped..

But every time I want to change the node configuration, I have to stop the docker image.

And when I run it again, it requires an init.url and downloads a 33 gig file and starts the sync from the beginning every time.

When I run geth it uses the chain dir and I have complete control, but since docker takes over a lot of overhead, it’s tough to control.

Is there any way to stop the node, change flag params, and restart it, without having to sync the whole chain every time, while still using docker?
undefined says there is a way to download the nitro.tar file into your pc but i do not know how to init with it.. tried several times but i could not.. if you use linux use wget to download the initial db and than use flag --init.url="file:///your/db/directory/nitro.tar"
undefined says Regardless of whether you can or can’t, you have a fully synced chain, and having to start from the snapshot at all the second time is redundant
undefined says i would also be grateful if could send me your yaml file or docker command with flags so i see where i make mistakes
undefined says If you stop the node then restart it, it should pick back up
undefined says i do not know how to start it again.. i have 250gb synced but it can not start again.. i got a power failure and now when the server is up again i can not start it..
undefined says Yeah that’s what I’m saying, when you leave it to docker, it’ll create a new container, I’ve had to resync twice
undefined says And docs don’t have much direction on other options
undefined says wtf.. sync may be up to 30 days..
undefined says i have that problem also.. wanted to upgrade to the newest docker image after the power failure and now the chain can not be started.. i agree that the docs don't have that info..
undefined says do you have the whole blockchain synced? i do not but i guess it has to start from where it was left off..
undefined says I am a noob and want to learn how to run an own node having the hardware to do it to learn new skills, can you advice me a guide to follow from zero to full nitro node?
undefined says wow
undefined says so much things to learn.. linux, hardening.. should have worked as devops, infrastructure engineer so you can run a node.. without techniques it will take more than 1-2 years in learning so you know what you are doing..
undefined says @CervezaDeVida | Pira Finance
undefined says Actually I am not 0. I have some programming skills and I am familiar with linux and ssh. I just want to move some step forward in this topic. If there is some material u can advice me would be great.
undefined says I want to use my machine in combination with alchemy to run it, I found a tutorial on Youtube and it seemed something not so absurd, but I would prefer to use my machine rather than a VPS server
undefined says if you use docker you have to use docker stop because the sync stated is in a tmpfs temp mount file in the docker container
undefined says if it shuts off or stops because of internet it will have to restartr
undefined says once you save it to the disc you remove the --init after the first time
undefined says What about a power failure? Will i be able to continue syncing?
undefined says if you didn't use docker stop
undefined says you will have to restart because it hasn't saved to the disc
undefined says not sure if there's a way to continue the same docker container though
undefined says I used it once.. the arb folder is 250gb but has errors when i want to start the new docker image..
undefined says might have to do
undefined says docker system prune
undefined says to delete the old tmpfs
undefined says I had a outage too and had to do it
undefined says Has anyone here succesfully connected to their arbitrum rpc url?
undefined says it says I cannot fetch chain id on metamask
undefined says Is there docs for running a node without docker?
undefined says Do you mount your docker dir (/home/user/.arbitrum) to a host local dir?
undefined says We don’t have that docs, but you can follow this to compile: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says You need to configure the node to point to the correct blockchain network (e.g. mainnet, testnet). You can do this by modifying the node configuration file (e.g. config.toml) or by passing command-line arguments.
undefined says Sort of.. I `sudo mount`ed another internal nvme to the current drive and I'm dedicating that one to the node, but as far as docker's concerned it's the same file system, should be the same thing
undefined says Can docker write in that directory?
undefined says yeah, and it does
undefined says The main issue isn't the storage, it's the retrieval..
undefined says In geth, if I want to open the websocket ports, I stop the node, and re-run with the added flags
undefined says When I do this, it looks in /home/user/.whatever, wherever the chaindata folder is, and it picks up where it left off
undefined says But with the websocket port opened
undefined says For Arbitrum, when you use docker, a container is initiated, and a dir is created in the docker root folder for it
undefined says So if you stop the docker arbitrum node image (say to change flags), and restart it,
undefined says it needs to re-download the 33 gig bootstrap file, and resync from the beginning.
undefined says Mmm, it shouldn't do that. When syncing, the data is stored in the mounted volume, and when restarting, the node should pickup the data already stored in that volume.
2 questions:
- Does that happen only when you change flags? Or also when you stop and restart your node with the same command?
- Can you verify that data is still present in the mounted folder after stopping the node?
undefined says - No it also happens when I just stop and restart. If I don't provide an --init.url, it throws and error and terminates, despite a few hundred gigs of chain data already in the set dir
- Yes the data is still there
undefined says (As in, it seems like it needs the --init.url every time, and runs the download every time)
undefined says I'm gonna manually run through the nitro docker file this weekend to see what's going on

if it shouldn't be behaving this way, and no one else is getting these issues, it might be my setup
undefined says I'll post what I find here
undefined says Yes please, thanks.
Another quick test you can do is to mount the volume in a different folder (in the same device than the node) to see if there are some issues when accessing that dir.
undefined says I tried that too, and had the same result.

My OS drive is 500gb, and my mounted is 2tb. I tested the sync up til around 40 million blocks on the 500gb machine, and yeah, same deal

And for the mounted drive, again, as far as docker is concerned, it's on the same drive. I triple checked dir permissions and I don't think it's a drive issue, but I'll test that this weekend too.
undefined says i was reading this conversation because i had also similar problem but the blockchain was syncing when i had power failure.. I fixed everything but after when i wanted to continue syncing i got errors.. Will this happen every time i have a power failure? I had to start the syncing from start and now i have to wait 20 days to resync the whole blockchain.. To state also that i wanted to change to the newest docker image also after the power failure.. Can this be somehow solved so after power outage i do not have to resync everything?
undefined says i was thinking of doing a weekly backup with cron job to stop the docker, after that makes the backup of the current blockchain db and in the end start it again.. what do you think of that?
undefined says create a support ticket so an admin can assist you @kingot
undefined says how do i open a ticket though?
undefined says okay
undefined says Could you send me your start command?
undefined says Could you please also send your start command?
undefined says I downloaded tar file and run node with '--init.url="file:///~~~~/nitro.tar"' option.
After running, the compression is extracted for a few minutes, and then the following error occurs.
err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory".
Is someone help me?
undefined says ```

```
undefined says I can see LOCK file, arbitrumdata directory, classic-msg directory, jwtsecret file, l2chaindata directory, nodekey file, nodes directory, triecache directory in ~~~/arb1/nitro directory.
undefined says Test
undefined says I sovled this problem!
1. Delete all files in /arbitrum/arb1
2. Move all file from unzipped nitro.tar file to /arbitrum/arb1/nitro
3. Run node without --init options
undefined says Test
undefined says hi，team，does arbitrum support light node , just storage the latest status
undefined says Only full node for now, although there is work in progress to support pruning.
undefined says How to configure access control for RPCs on Arbitrum Full node?
undefined says Hey guys, may I ask

**What is the Uniswap Router address for Arbitrum One?**
undefined says 
undefined says Do you know how to solve the not being able to fetch chain id when using the rpc url in metamask error?
undefined says Are #arb will be allocated for running arbitrum nodes???
undefined says @habibmonjezi have you been able to get your airdrop now
undefined says this is the command and error i got i wanted to start my node again after the power faiilure..
undefined says i have the same error even when i do not have the  init-url flag..
undefined says Can anyone point me tot the latest snapshot URL?
undefined says you have it in my pic i posted above and also the documents..
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1090206322525478922
undefined says how much time does it take for a node to sync?
undefined says depends on your hardware but approx. 30 days took mine
undefined says oh ok
undefined says even if it is just full, not archive?
btw I am facing an issue. It gives me error if I try to use downlaoded snapshot
undefined says 
undefined says i have this error but i could not resolve it.. still waiting.. use the link in the documents to initialize the db from the web resource..
undefined says not sure but i think you must have the whole db.. and it is around 400gb.. someone who is part of the team can answer this question 😄
undefined says Lol
undefined says Ah ok, the one I have is 330gb
undefined says If I try with a non-root user I get this
undefined says the blockchain folder where the db will be written must have all privileges 777.. use chmod -fR 777 /blockchainfolder
undefined says send the command you use to start the validator to have a look
undefined says Is there any way to create our own snapshots?
undefined says No
undefined says is this normal ? not no the same  block
undefined says omniatech is highest but slowest.
undefined says the problem is that my local dir already has privileges. The dir described in the message is the dir inside docker volume.
undefined says Send the starting command that you enter to have a look and send ls -la of ypur home directory
undefined says docker compose up ls -la ?
undefined says btw last night I tried using the last snapshot url and seems to be working. Even if I thought that it was of december but it started fetching block from october
undefined says (i am using docker-compose)
undefined says drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096 Apr  1 20:08 .arbitrum
undefined says Hy, I have any doubts about Arbitrum.
Sequencers, block validators and verifiers are 3 different players?
undefined says do we have to enable anything to connect using wss to our node in local?
undefined says hmm.. try to start arbitrum blockchain with sudo and not with sudo su and than start the blockchain, find a good l1 rpc and use the official db snapshut.. If you get any errors please post them here as screenshot of the command and the error.. also i would suggest if you keep having errors to delete the arbitrum blockchain folder and start over..
undefined says ok for the moment I leave it syncing 
I'll retry in future
undefined says did not understand.. is the node syncing?
undefined says I ended doing it with the default init.url
undefined says send the starting command to have a look
undefined says i'll send asap
undefined says i could not start the node without the default init.url.. could not start a node with the db tar file downloaded in the server.. that is a problem and could not find a solution..
undefined says I followed this guide:
undefined says 
undefined says the mirror one
undefined says i do not know why you use mirror links when there are official ones that work.. but must have some skills and think it deeply to set it up
undefined says it is the same thing of the official one but with docker compose
undefined says so to start i just run docker compose up
undefined says btw I used the default snapshot url with nitro-recent tar
undefined says What’s a good setup for a node? That I would need?
undefined says 🇦🇩
undefined says noderunning
undefined says i do not use none official documents to setup a node.. i use the official documents and the new things in the announcement chat..
undefined says if nothing brakes It should be synced in 1day
undefined says how do you even sync a blockchain of 400gb in 1 day? 0_o
undefined says i set the last snapshot url as init.url
undefined says it downloaded it (330gb) and started from there
undefined says `l2Block=56,283,488`
undefined says who the hell was that crazy to upload 330gb snapshot 0_o
undefined says no idea
found it on #💻︱protocol
undefined says can you send me the link, i would be very grateful
undefined says yes but can't paste link here
undefined says sent
undefined says write me a private message ty
undefined says Syncing is stuck at block:73483897
undefined says `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"batchProcessed":117212,"batchSeen":117212,"blockNum":73483897,"broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos":54204518,"lastL1HeaderErr":{},"messageOfLastBlock":51276081,"messageOfProcessedBatch":51276081,"msgCount":51276081}}`
undefined says broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos is increasing but blockNum is the same since 2 days now
undefined says Do you run more than one node in the same ip?
undefined says How about eth_blockNumber return?
undefined says Are the '--init.*' options only needed the first time?
Is it ok to subtract after initializing with 'nitro.tar'?
undefined says Only needed first time.
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Same 73483897 (0x4614679)
undefined says where is this list from?
undefined says chainlist
undefined says Could you restart and add —log-level=5 to see if any other things happen?
undefined says To enable websocket I just have to add these right?

`WS port 8548 needs extra args to be opened. Please use these flags:
--ws.port=8548
--ws.addr=0.0.0.0
--ws.origins`
undefined says Is anything else needed to be able to connect to my node from outside docker but same server?
undefined says yes
undefined says how is it possible that a public rpc is faster than my node🥺
undefined says No, but your node might need to connect to l1 running on your host. (If you are running l1 locally)
undefined says yep everything working and in sync
undefined says It might be our rpc is not busy now, when it got busy, your node will be faster.
undefined says which is your ?
undefined says ah you mean the default one. No I was testing the difference between my node and alchemy
undefined says hey, I run a bunch of L2 nodes and use a geth+nimbus as my L1 RPC and have been wondering if there is something with a lesser footprint (don't need an archive node). Also does the L1 RPC responsiveness impact the L2 node in any meaningful way?
undefined says L1 RPC responsiveness does have a minor impact in the L2 node, as the latter will verify the transactions it has read from the Sequencer feed against the ones posted in the L1 batch.
undefined says Fixed...was a different issue
undefined says I am loading the nitro-recent.tar snapshot and syncing the blocks. However, in the middle, errors such as 'err="abi: attempting to unmarshall on empty string while arguments are expected' often appear. The block sync is still going well, but is there any problem?
undefined says Also, I sometimes see errors like 'err="message not found"', 'err="failed to fetch batch mentioned by batch posting report: not found"'.
undefined says Can I ignore this errors?
undefined says Can you send a picture of what you mean
undefined says I was getting same issues but I just ignored them
undefined says 
undefined says can someone tell me what is the average speed of sync in gb per hour?
undefined says i can see that my syncing is slow.. i am using raid 5 and 500/500 mbps connection
undefined says 200mb-300mb per hour is mine...
undefined says 
undefined says I calculated only how many blocks it was fetching per minute
undefined says and was around 11k blocks
undefined says Also, make sure your L1 node is synced correctly. It looks like it might come from there.
undefined says v
undefined says what is the current size of full nodes?
undefined says can you send the link to me too?
undefined says .
undefined says Should be around 1.3-1.5 TB although I'm not 100% sure. In any case, it is advised to reserve some more than that.
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says thanks
undefined says As a reference point:
impact@x6:~$ du -hs ~/.arbitrum/
2.6T    /home/impact/.arbitrum/
undefined says Thanks. Is that a non-archive nitro node?
undefined says Oh, sorry, thats an archive, thought thats what you were referencing.
undefined says Non-archive nitro is:
256G    /home/ubuntu/.arbitrum/
undefined says That seems very little 😅 
Is it fully synced?
undefined says (Assuming is Arbitrum One, non Goerli)
undefined says Yep, they grow huge over time, and then I "prune" them by re-syncing.  That one is resync'd from a few weeks ago, it will grow to 500-600gb in a month or two and get resync'd again.  Starting from a fresh sync (not the nitro-recent.tar) helps a lot with size as well.  My guess is the nitro-recent.tar was created from one of the non-pruned versions at that time
undefined says is there a "prune" command like for geth?
undefined says Ah, that makes sense, yeah. Thanks for sharing :arbiblobblue:
undefined says I started mine few days ago and is already 503 Gb. How do you do this: "Starting from a fresh sync (not the nitro-recent.tar) helps a lot with size as well"
undefined says Not yet, but the team is working on that.
undefined says so when I need to clean space I have to delete everything and re-sync from the start?
undefined says That's an option, yeah. At least until pruning is available
undefined says ok thanks. Curious  to know how @impact do
undefined says Just using the default one listed in the "running a node" doc:  https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
undefined says Using that one and syncing from it gives me a like ~200gb node
undefined says Using the "-recent" version gives a few hundred gigs more
undefined says I see
and ETA using that snapshot?
undefined says Using -recent it took 2 days for me
undefined says Definitely takes longer, but not by a ton
undefined says Probably an extra 24hrs?
undefined says I still have 1.3 Tb, let's see
undefined says Is there a reason why arbtrace API calls are not available beyond 22207814?
undefined says And what's the alternative?
undefined says debug_ ?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Are there parity style traces on post nitro blocks?
undefined says Nitro uses debug style calls instead of parity
undefined says So no alternative. Debug style traces are available on both pre and post nitro
undefined says Parity for classic (pre-nitro), and debug for nitro
undefined says Thanks
undefined says why the nitro node snapshot download is slow? my connection is 900gbps but downloading the snapshot with 2mbps?
undefined says hey having an issue with running my archive node
undefined says im able to do basic blocknumber requests and all
undefined says but any interaction on things like  uniswap gives me 

'header not found'
undefined says WARN [04-05|20:43:44.236] Served eth_call                          conn="X" reqid=752              duration="521.182µs"      err="header not found"
undefined says Same logs as uploaded by FreeZy
undefined says I just use public node provided by ankr. Should I change my public RPC?
undefined says And I wonder if this error is non-fatal and can be ignored.
undefined says You can try download it to your server directly rather than use `init.url`, sometimes this will ba faster.
undefined says What is your node’s current height? Did you set `--node.rpc.gas-cap` when start your node?
undefined says You might switch to another l1 rpc for better.
undefined says why does the classic node sync from the start always ?
undefined says You can use this snapshot so you don’t need to sync: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar , note classic node can only sync to 22207816
undefined says Does this include up to 22207816?
undefined says Yup
undefined says Great thankyou 🫡
undefined says I go errors in that way.. i will post later.. can you tell me if the right flag for using local copy of the db is: --init.url="file:///home/myuser/dblocation/dbname.tar"
undefined says The init.url will read your docker container’s dir not your host’s dir, you should mount this file to your docker first and then read to that mount point.
undefined says That was not explained in the documents, thank you
undefined says Oh, we put it at troubleshooting page: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says I think the docs should be uodated.. too many things but in different places.. will make a branch and update the official docs
undefined says Yup, we update the docs very frequently haha.
undefined says Whart can I do if my node is 10s late?
undefined says I am getting this error on an Arbitrum node I'm trying to sync: error creating blocks                    err="missing trie node f4df8bae6ce69bf9a909fc43d97ad331aa61007feabb322eb26261a65451aaab (owner eb93f41485f2d423fa139a74a5c3ea6a2c1ee1d6b6e025e8dd3e74a9d5719021) (path 01020e03) <nil>"
undefined says How do I fix it?
undefined says check your network
undefined says Hello! I have problem that why im sending transaction via my own node or via sequencer link dierectly it takes like 200-300 ms to get hash. I have 4-5 ms ping to sequencer from my server, so it must take way lower time. Is any way to reduce it?
undefined says I just tried that, now it's printing a new error

undefined says Your node database crashed, you should resync it, you should shut down your node gracefully with the following command: docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq) next time to avoid this.
undefined says Alright thanks
undefined says I see no traces for transaction `0x2d7517a11650f84ac20ea600bbf20e166b829bf4b797e6e6abde7144057a3e4a` on block 29. With the arbtrace_ trace calls
undefined says Is it normal that bridge transactions have no traces?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says can someone guide me for the incentives for running full node #arbitrum @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs @tsahi
undefined says isn't there a BSC fastnode equivalent for ARB nodes? I was able to run the node with the nitro snap on my server but this will take like 2-4 days until it's fully synced? it started from september 2022 and it took almost 6h just to finish one month..
undefined says will it be faster if I use this snap? https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says I used the one from the standart cfg
undefined says I’m currently thinking of building a pc and I’m interested in running an Arbitrum node. Does anyone have recommendations for which CPUs to look into?
undefined says Where can companies apply to become whitelisted validators?
undefined says how can i connect to the sequencer with lowest latency?
undefined says Is there any more recent snapshot for mainnet, which can be used to sync?
undefined says I can help you
undefined says Guide me sir
undefined says I am trying to install Arbitrum node. But I did not decide the location. What is your recommended position?
undefined says I am trying to find a monitoring solution for Arbitrum mainnet node? can anybody please suggest me a better monitoring solutions?
undefined says In classic, this deposit tx can’t be traced.
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says This will be faster, this record to December 2022.
undefined says Prometheus and Grafana with the metrics endpoint enabled is what I'd recommend
undefined says Incentives for running a node. As it needs to be funded by my own funds. Plz guide
undefined says Any updated on this?
undefined says I am asking on behalf of Plutus DAO , we'd like to run a validator node.
undefined says Hey, please send an email to our partnerships: `partnerships@offchainlabs.com`
undefined says Thank you
undefined says I'm trying to get information to run my own Arbitrum **Testnet **RPC Node. 

Is there anyone who can help me?
undefined says Hey you can follow this guide:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
And use 421613 for the --l2.chain-id
undefined says Also here is the image that works for setting up the nitro goerli testnet node: `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3`
undefined says So... Everything the same except for the "421613 for the --l2.chain-id" ?
undefined says And for --l1.url parameter? Could you give me some indications about the minimum L1 Ethereum deploy set if I want to run the Eth node by myself? Could both nodes (Arb + Eth) run at the same host?
undefined says whats the growth rate of non-archival im currently sitting on 232GB on a 2TB disk, thinking of adding a Nova node on the same disk, but if it will fill in a year maybe not
undefined says For minimum l1 node set, you could visit https://geth.ethereum.org , and you can run those 2 node at the same host.
undefined says 3 GB per day
undefined says How much network traffic for Arbitrum node?
undefined says You can see here: https://arbiscan.io
undefined says Sorry, I want to know about recommended network bandwidth for installing arbitrum node.
undefined says Where is the Arbitrum sequencer located?
undefined says I used to run with 5m cloud server, but not sure if it works when the bandwidth lower than this. Also, it depends on how many requests you will send to your node.
undefined says US.
undefined says Hey devs, I'm looking at provisioning a local dev stack of arbitrum nitro but I've ran into some issues on MacOS. 

It looks like container for offchainlabs/blockscout (https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/blockscout/tags) is not compatible with M1 macbooks.

The problem this is causing me is he blockscout container is showing the familiar:
```
qemu: uncaught target signal 11 (Segmentation fault) - core dumped
Segmentation fault
```

I am able build blockscout locally using the source provided with:
```
      docker build blockscout -t blockscout -f blockscout/docker/Dockerfile
```

But when running `test-node.bash` with the `--init` flag selected, we always re-tag the container image for `blockscout-testnet` with the outdated version on docker hub. 

I'm curious if the team are planning to publish an updated blockscout image to docker hub for M1 mac developers, or if we should look at other solution in the `test-node.bash`
undefined says I'm also running into problems building all of the container images, where I eventually run out of disk space with the command:
```
test-node.bash --build
```
 I was just curious if other people are hitting this problem or just me
undefined says I am running ethereum L1 node with docker. But showing the following messages for 10 minutes. Is it running correctly?
undefined says Hey guys,
I'm running into an issue when trying to set up the Nitro client's L1 RPC connection with a self-hosted Erigon node. This is the response from the L1 node when starting up the client:
```INFO [04-12|07:12:53.146] received error response from L1 RPC      request="{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"eth_chainId\"}" response=nil err="403 Forbidden: missing token\n"
WARN [04-12|07:12:53.146] error connecting to L1                   err="403 Forbidden: missing token\n"```
The error message guides me to this line (https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/blob/47fd86e4fb34045413f37ceb7c026cca05ade926/rpc/http.go#L295) in the Eirgon source code, which seems to indicate that the `jwtsecret` hasn't been received properly. However, I've confirmed that the nitro client loads the correct secret from file (`--auth.jwtsecret=<path/to/secret/file>`) so I'm thinking something else is acting up along the way.

Does anyone here recognize the error, or have some other idea as to what might be wrong?
undefined says I'm getting this error from inside the container:

`Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/goerli-rollup: permission denied`

I'm using this command:

`docker run --rm -it -v /home/arbitrum/arbitrum.testnet:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3 --l1.url https://eth-goerli.public.blastapi.io --l2.chain-id=421613 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*`


Any idea?
undefined says The same in mainnet:


`Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1: permission denied`

with this command: 
`
docker run --rm -it -v /home/arbitrum/arbitrum.mainnet:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.12-65d4e7a --l1.url https://eth.llamarpc.com --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*`

undefined says Should I lauch it as "root"?
undefined says You should grant permission: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#note-on-permissions
undefined says What is the version of your nitro node?
undefined says Using version v2.0.13-174496c
undefined says Did you see `Loaded JWT secret file` (log) when your node start?
undefined says And you should make sure your jwt path is mounted to your docker container so docker can read it.
undefined says Can your l1 node serve your rpc request correctly? Is says you don’t run a consensus layer of your l1 node.
undefined says Hey everyone, 

I am trying to run a feed relay and getting issues connecting it to the nodes
Which method a node is using in order to connect to feed relay and get this responses https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed?

Just want to use it in order to debug quicker
undefined says No, though I do get `created jwt file` when not providing it. Based on that I'm assuming it does find it when provided, since no other error message is produced. Though perhaps I should expect to get a `using existing jwt file` message (source code: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/e6d01471459f7e48fef715b1949b23a4852bd48e/cmd/nitro/nitro.go#L261) 🤔

Also, I cannot find a log with `Loaded JWT secret file` in the source code, are you sure I should be expecting that log to show up?
undefined says If I want to run a historical arbitrum node do I need both classic and nitro nodes, or can I just run nitro node?
undefined says I want to index all transactions from the beginning of chain
undefined says Thanks! That worked
undefined says is there any parameter to serve https and wss (secure) ?
undefined says On the other hand, I'm trying to connect to WS and I'm allways getting 

 `error: connect ECONNREFUSED my_arb_node_ip:8548`
undefined says locally and also from another host
undefined says http RPC Api is working but WS is not
undefined says Locally:
undefined says 
undefined says Forget it, I was missing the --ws parameters... OMG, I'm stu.pid
undefined says Yes, I am sure, the code you post is occurs when jwtsecret doesn’t set. You might don’t mount your jwt file to docker point so your docker doesn’t read that file correctly. (Which means you might use your host’s path rather than docker container’s path)
undefined says That log’s source is here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/6cc497e1010d43b306c9ef250da54a144e01ce09/node/node.go#L365
undefined says If you don’t need archive data, you just need to run nitro (nitro also contains classic’s block header and tx)
undefined says I want to replay all arbitrum txs, do I need to have classic node in that case?
undefined says Replay them, analyse them and store them to db
undefined says I would like to listen for txs from relay so I wonder will I get old pre-nitro txs on relay?
undefined says If so, you need run archive mode: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-an-archive-node
undefined says Thank you 🙏 Do you know will nitro relay recieve messages from classic node for txs that unfolded before nitro upgrade?
undefined says how do you get WL to run a validator?
undefined says How to fix `Connection aborted.` errors in rpc?
undefined says Especially I am calling `debug_traceBlockByNumber`
undefined says with array of requests in rpc
undefined says How to reduce the response duration for the debug_traceBlockByNumber method in the SS attached
undefined says Did you call your own node or our public rpc? Does that errors also show on your logs?
undefined says The relayer is used to push sequencer’s messages to nodes.
undefined says 
undefined says

undefined says 
undefined says my feed-relay is stuck on websocket ping and no new blocks are obtained. how can i debug this?
i am running on v2.13
undefined says I am currently running a Geth full node + Lighthouse + Arbitrum nitro combination. Which works. But I was wondering if its possible to replace the Geth full node with a Geth light client? Will that be incompatible with the Arbitrum nitro node?
undefined says Any errors report? Or does it work if you re run your relayer?
undefined says You need to run full l1 node.
undefined says this is the logs from the websocat to the feed-relay. same behavior after rerunning
```
[INFO  websocat::ws_peer] Received WebSocket ping
```
undefined says When you wscat to your relayer feed, does it return something?
 wscat -c ws://localhost:9642
undefined says nope, just the websocket ping repeatedly
undefined says Oh, that’s super weird, no errors like 403 at your feed relayer either right?
undefined says oh yeah you're right, nevermind.
undefined says how is it possible that someone is placing his tx always at first index of the block? Using a smart contract to interact with another contract should be slower than directly calling a function no?
undefined says 1. Hi! There're two docker images in the `required artifcats` do I need to run both of them for an archive node?
I want to index all arbitrum mainnet chain for analytical purposes.
I've downloaded the db archive for the classic node
`609G    db`
 and run it in the following way:
`docker run -d --name arbitrum  -v $PWD:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 127.0.0.1:8547:8547 -p 127.0.0.1:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url=http://<my_full_archive_geth_mainnet_node> --node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000 --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --wait-to-catch-up --log.core debug --log.rpc debug --core.debug --core.debug-timing`
Unfortunately it doesn't sync for a few days and displays the following logs:

```
2. What can be a reason for the following behaviour (my node timeoute is set to 7200 seconds)?
undefined says 
undefined says Because Arbitrum One genesis from Classic stack and running for 1 years (before block height 2207817), and now it upgrades to Nitro stack.
Although we move Classic's latest state as Nitro's genesis state (see [state migration](../migration/state-migration.mdx)), but nitro stack can't serve arcive requests for pre-nitro blocks, so you have 3 options to run an Arbitrm One archive node:
1. Only post-nitro archive requests needs, you can see [running-a-node].
2. Only pre-nitro archive requests needs, you can see [running-a-classic-node]
3. Both post-nitro and pre-nitro archive requests needs, then you should run not only archive nitro node but also archive classic node.
undefined says Thank you!
What about classic node not syncing with timeouts?
undefined says Classic node can just use the snapshot we provide that that docs to start, it doesn’t need sync. But starting a classic node might takes a few hours (sometimes more than 10 hours), it depends on your disk latency.
undefined says So the only thing it asks my l1 node was eth_chainId , can you please tell your thoughts why is it timeouting, for what requests?
undefined says Where is the timeout comes from? Your l1 node url?
undefined says 
undefined says Yes, from the l1 node, as the classic node logs displays: 
```
{"level":"warn","component":"monitor","stack":[{"func":"(*SequencerInboxWatcher).LookupBatchesInRange","line":"112","source":"sequencerInboxWatcher.go"},{"func":"(*InboxReader).getMessages","line":"299","source":"inboxReader.go"},{"func":"(*InboxReader).Start.func1","line":"117","source":"inboxReader.go"},{"func":"goexit","line":"1581","source":"asm_amd64.s"}],"error":"504 Gateway Time-out: <html>\r\n<head><title>504 Gateway Time-out</title></head>\r\n<body bgcolor=\"white\">\r\n<center><h1>504 Gateway Time-out</h1></center>\r\n<hr><center>nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n","time":"2023-04-09T19:22:15Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-node-core/monitor/inboxReader.go:126","message":"failed to read inbox messages"}
``` 
The thing is that my l1 node timeout was set to 3600 seconds, just increased it to 7200 seconds. and nothing changes.
undefined says Can you connect to l1 node from curl directly? And if so, can you try do this within that docker container?
undefined says sure, I can, and I see in my nginx logs what requests have been served.
undefined says C'mooon guys, this is annoying!
undefined says 
undefined says Hey 
I am currently running a private Nitro node on GCP. Whenever I attempt to retrieve the debug_traceBlockByNumber for a batch size of approximately 100, I do not receive a response, and the connection is terminated.
undefined says Hard to say with that information. Let me ask you some questions:
- Can you query smaller batches?
- Is the node still alive after cutting the connection?
- I'm not very familiar with GCP. Is there anything in the middle that might be causing a timeout?
undefined says Does it works within your nitro node docker container?
undefined says My Arbitrum One full node has been synced over 36h. But Still not finished. I used docker command.
This is my node spec.
4-core, 16G RAM, 1.5T SSD.

Can I speedup syncing of my node?
undefined says Syncing speed is related to L1 node?
undefined says Please help me 😭 😭 😭
undefined says How much time it takes generally?
undefined says 3-5 days
undefined says 🙏  Thanks. How can I speed up?
Is there any way for installing node simply?
undefined says Anyone there? I have encountered this problem.
undefined says 
undefined says This is my startup command.
docker run -d -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-alpha.2-e6d0147  --l1.url http://********* --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*  --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*  --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says Which blocks do you sync to? We have a snapshot which is December 2022
undefined says Did you add init.url the first time?
undefined says This is current state of syncing. Please teach me how to speed up.
undefined says All the logs above and the problem I described was with the classic node. But as you mentioned-the classic node doesn't need to sync if run from archive.

At the moment I'm trying to sync the nitro and it's syncing good enough - on 26.09.2022 blocks now
undefined says 👆
undefined says Seems your classic node is syncing, are you sure you use the snapshot? I am afraid you might mount to wrong point.
undefined says It depends on your disk latency and network status, seems your now should sync to January 2023, so our recent snapshot can’t help you now.
undefined says I see Thanks.
undefined says - tried with smaller batch size as well
- yes the node is still alive
- No as other method like eth_getblockbynumber works fine


Is there any configuration that i need to change so that i can increase timeout ??
undefined says Is your node archive mode?
undefined says Yes, because I saw the log:
{"level":"info","component":"txdb","l2Block":"22207816","l1Block":"15447157","transactionCount":"24956558","logCount":"47264323","blockTimestamp":"2022-08-31T14:32:22Z","blockHash":"0x3cdb24001ff0fbe672f6223fd36e5065d2b1c3f7c055e08f71809acc298538ad","time":"2023-04-13T08:48:37Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-rpc-node/txdb/txdb.go:216","message":"sync update"}
But surprisingly, it queries block by block my geth node for bevery block displaying something like "looking up for messages"
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Yes, this is my first time running a node, and I saw that it downloaded the file /tmp/nitro.tar.
undefined says Should I use the "init.url" command with "file:/tmp/nitro"? However, I am not very familiar with Docker. How can I modify the running parameters for containers that are already up and running?
undefined says I have solved this problem. nitro.tar needs to be extracted into the specified database directory (I think this should be mentioned in the official documentation). After that, run the command without "--init.url".
undefined says I was running an archive node. Now is there any flag for timeouts? Basically i was running tracing commands and while doing that, the connection breaks for some of those trace commands. I can't even see any logs pertaining to it in the node. 
The only log that comes is "served debug_traceBlockByNumber". Please help! Thanks!
undefined says How about your ram and disk usage when you send batch?
Can it work when only send one request?
undefined says --http.server-timeouts.write-timeout
You can see all the commands add —help to your node start command.
undefined says can you show exactly where?
undefined says 
undefined says I am trying to query a smart contract value on every block. I am using on new block subscription to do it. So the way it works is I query the contract on every block received. But this method skips few blocks in between randomly. Maybe the blocks are too fast or am I doing something different or is there a better way to do this? i using my own node.Thanks.
undefined says please clarify the current situation with the validator system. Are they making a profit at the moment? Is the number of active validators limited? Сan i become a validator now ?
undefined says so give or take a few GB
since asking about 2 days 14 hours, it increased by 3GB 
does anyone have the size of Nova ?
undefined says No I didn’t, had to resync from scratch
undefined says Seems like it’s fine now, it hasn’t stopped since then
undefined says I’m not sure what might be wrong
undefined says you can become validator but not whitelisted yet.. check the official docs and set your machine up
undefined says seems like disk errors.. i would suggest you to check them with smart and other tools..
undefined says Anyone managed to run a node with a locally downloaded snapshot ?
undefined says I tried with --init.url="file:///home/user/[..]/db.tar", which didn't work, error was : 
" error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
undefined says I also tried extracting the content of db.tar to /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro, without success
undefined says While syncing, my arbitrum node sometimes is being frozen (3 times for 2 days, so I restarted). Node specs is the following 
CPU 8 cores, 16GRAM,  1.5T,  BandWidth 10M
I used docker command.
What is the problem?
undefined says Hey how do you make it so docker can write to your datadir?
undefined says How to handle nitro.tar that you mentioned? You can download it to your local machine and then extract it into the database file directory specified when starting the node. The directory is similar to /home/ubuntu/arbitrum/data/arbitrum, but note that it should not be extracted into the container directory.
undefined says I did exactly this but never worked
undefined says was giving always errors
undefined says how did you pass the path to --init-url?

file:///... 

or "file:///...."

with or without quotes?
undefined says This is obviously an issue from your own wallet
undefined says wallet?
undefined says does anyone have a sample docker compose yml file for running their nitro node?
undefined says i did not start it in that way but i know how.. you have to attach it into docker and than init from there..
undefined says Friends, help me please.
Flashbots are not supported in arbitrum, but how can I send transactions in one block (bundles) in these networks? 
Does anyone know? At least direct please in which direction to read.
undefined says Any ideas why you want to do this? Arbitrum doesn’t like ethereum, we don’t have fixed block time, so it should be not so necessary to include your tx in the same block.
undefined says Once you have extracted the nitro.tar file to your database directory, the command "-init-url" is no longer needed and should not appear in your startup command.
undefined says docker run -d -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-alpha.2-e6d0147  --l1.url http://yourETHrpc  --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*  --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*
undefined says My client has a drainer on his wallet.  He does not have time to send the transaction erc20, because eth has already been withdrawn.  Therefore, I need to send an eth deposit transaction + an erc20 withdrawal transaction in one block.
undefined says This is my startup command, assuming that I have manually downloaded and extracted nitro.tar to /home/ubuntu/arbitrum/data/arbitrum.
undefined says You can try sign 2 txns and send them at the same time, we use first come first serve.
undefined says But I have error. insufficient gas balance
undefined says Any ideas how to send in one block?
undefined says No, put send eth tx first, and send them the same time.
undefined says The block item is not the same as ethereum, we would say tx order be better. And there is no such a way to ensure you can include 2 tx in the same block.
undefined says I would recommend write a script, sign those 2 txns (put send eth as the first one), then send them to the rpc at the same time.
undefined says I will try again thx 🙏
undefined says I faced "out of gas" error while calling "view" function of contract with my Arbitrum-One node.
I did not face this error with QuickNode RPC. How can I solve this?
undefined says You need this --node.rpc.gas-cap
Defaults to 50000000, cap on computation gas that can be used in eth_call/estimateGas (0 = no cap)
undefined says do you think that signing a tx and then send it is faster than directly interacting with a contract? Supposing that the function arguments are not known in advance.

So:
Case A: receive the arguments, build the payload and sign the tx, then forward to the rpc

Case B: reveive the arguments, call directly the write function on the contract
undefined says Still no newer snapshots or sample docker compose file?
undefined says Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --node.validator.enable
undefined says getting this
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 
I installed Arbitrum-One node in Frankfurt.
My transactions are placing in second block from the submitted block. How can I submit my transactions as fast as possible? Should I move my node location?
undefined says Just asking here as I am not able to get response in optimism community . When I am doing a batched debug_traceblock, the response seems to be much slower. Is there any flag through which one can decrease this response time. Or a way to multi-thread response? If anyone has any idea about optimism?
undefined says if you are using the latest docker image node.validator is changed with node.staker
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.12
undefined says sure am, thanks!
undefined says can also confirm new names are better than old ones
undefined says it does not matter.. What matters is that all the required info should be on one place not on 100 places..
undefined says Very true
undefined says and. newer. snapshot
undefined says when I get a free time of 2-3 hours in the next period i will update the page.. new info must be inserted.. also i will make a new snapshot but i do not know where to upload it..
undefined says how I can launch L3 Arbitrum Orbit?
I send E-Mail but not get answered
undefined says open ticket
undefined says Where I can do this ?
undefined says Not yet unfortunately
undefined says It depends on two things:
1. geo location as you said (we cannot talk about the node location)
2. network congestion, because transactions are first come first serve, so all txs received prior to yours are in the line
undefined says We're still working on the docs + instructions to release!
undefined says Got you, thanks. Any deadlines?
undefined says And can I launch Nitro node as L3?
undefined says Is there a way to transfer arbitrum nitro data from one node to new node quickly? It's average 1.5 mbps/s through sftp now. Many thanks!
undefined says Yup, of course, you can choose to run as rollups or anytrust mode.
undefined says You just need to copy that data dir will be ok, but you need shutdown your node first and then copy it.
undefined says if i send transaction thought arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc . will the transaction go directly to the sequencer？
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs can you help me ?
undefined says This is our public rpc, it will forward your tx to sequencer.
undefined says Is there any rpc that can directly connect to the sequencer
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Hey guys,
I'm trying to get a Testnet node to run but am getting an error message with `CRIT  error getting rollup addresses`.

This error is new to me, can't find anything about it in the node running guide. Does someone here know more about it?
undefined says are u guys still accepting new node runners
undefined says guys, can someone please share docs or if it possible at all to run arbitrum nodes not via docker? but in Ubuntu itself
undefined says You can follow this to compile: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says Did you make some changes to your config file about the rollups address?
undefined says Our fullnode and watchTover validator is permissionless: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs i seed the config --node.forwarding-target=<sequencer RPC>  in doc .  so what is the sequencer RPC?
undefined says Not intentionally, am I supposed to?

Is there some documentation regarding setting up a testnet node, apart from the "running-a-node" page, that you could point me to?
undefined says It used by sequencer to get messages from fullnode
undefined says How do you start your node? By using our docker? And what is your test node mean? Does it connect to arb1 network? Or just connect to your local network for test?
undefined says so my node will will forward the transaction to public rpc  . then public rpc forward the transaction to sequencer?
undefined says I'm running without Docker, on Ubuntu 22.04,  and the full command I'm trying right now would be

`./nitro --l2.chain-id=421613 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.forwarding-target="null" --persistent.chain="/home/nitro/.arbitrum" --l1.url=<my L1 RPC> --node.caching.archive --metrics`

I'm working on setting up a node to connect to the Nitro Goerli Rollup Testnet, the one listed with ID 421613 here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains. Not sure if that is the same as the "arb1 network", I'm new in the Arbitrum space!

From what I understand, reading the running-a-node pages, the only thing separating running mainnet and testnet Nitro nodes is the choice of L2 ID. But perhaps there are more configurations to take into account?
undefined says Is your l1 rpc is goerli rpc? Could you provide the full error logs? Like something earlier than that error logs.
undefined says Yup, and the node doesn’t push tx anymore, it’s a new url.
undefined says 
undefined says My node has been synced for 5 days and still not synced well, still 10 million blocks short, can anyone tell me how to speed it up?
undefined says That might be it, the L1 RPC I'm using is the same I used when running a mainnet Nitro node. It needs to be a L1 Goerli testnet RPC instead?

Hmm I can't post the error log, the bot warns me about duplicated text. But what i get is the normal startup messages up until "connected to l1 chain" which is followed by a number of "invalid address" and the "error getting rollup addresses" message.
undefined says How long have you been experiencing this error? @jakob
undefined says sorry I do not quite understand. what does the new url mean
undefined says Oh, sorry, I miss typing old url, I mean we have changed the forward url in nitro default config to a new url last month.
undefined says Oh, if you want to run goerli-arbi, you should use goerli’s rpc url as your l1 rpc url.
undefined says ok  what is the new url ?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/cmd/nitro/nitro.go#L817
undefined says ok .thanks very much
undefined says Since I started trying to get a testnet node to run :))

However, changing the `--l1.url` setting to point at a L1 Goerli node seems to have solved my problem. The client syncing up right away 👌 

Thanks for the help! @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Continuing on the subject of the Nitro testnet, about how large in disksize is the testnet chain? And the expected growth rate?

I can find numbers for the mainnet chain by searching this Discord server but numbers for the testnet is harder to locate.

Edit: nvm, I found a mention: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1083305081480413274
undefined says I'm now running an arb nitro node. Does the node auto prune or do I have to set that up myself. If so could any one point me in the right direction to resources
undefined says open ticket
undefined says The prune function should be available in our next node version.
undefined says Ok so there is no way to currently prune? Maybe I am not understanding something properly....
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs is this spam? I don't see anyone else opening tickets?
undefined says They are sending dms with links to open tickets to speak with admin
undefined says Are there public sequencers or do I need to run my own sequencer If I want to run Nitro node?
undefined says Is there a recent snapshot for Nitro? 
Using init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar" it starts from November 2022, it's going to take weeks to sync
undefined says I am getting this error after transferring data from one node to another: ERROR[04-19|12:17:40.757] Truncating ancient chain                 from=81,618,401 to=81,435,101 can you help me how I can fix it?
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I moved node with nitro database. I started node with origin database without "--init.url" param. But I faced the error same as above and staying for 2 hours.  Is it going correctly?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Do you know how to decode the l2Msg from sequencer feed use js ？
undefined says How long did your Nitro node take to sync? Did you use init.url with nitro-recent.tar ?
undefined says It took about 4 days. I used init.url as "nitro.tar" in old node. In new node, I did not use "init.url" param.
undefined says Until when is the "nitro-recent.tar" snapshot?
undefined says Something like November 27-28, so that's still a lot to download until today
Do you remember what date your nitro.tar started?
undefined says Btw, Do you have any solution for my issue. I am running new node with old sync data.  These data already synced till yesterday in old node.
undefined says I'm not part of the team, but maybe that's not an error and just an operation that takes a lot of time?
undefined says How to solve "feedOneMsg failed to send message to execEngine err="wrong message number in digest got 1 expected 0." ?
undefined says You node is rewinding, you can wait it a bit longer.
undefined says You may need this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/blob/main/packages/batch-tx-handler/src/l1-batch-handler/utils.ts#L88
undefined says Please don’t trust any dms, we won’t dm first.
undefined says This is the latest snapshot we provide.
undefined says Where did you get this error messages?
undefined says I run nitro full node with `./nitro --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" --l1.url=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --l2.chain-id=42161`
undefined says Is that error message come from your log?
undefined says Yes. Here is the full node
undefined says 
undefined says Did you use init.url to download nitro genesis db?
undefined says yes
undefined says I run the node use this command, anything wrong?
undefined says Oh, sorry, I missed that, checking
undefined says How to solve it?
undefined says Seems you are using t an old version of node, you should use the latest code to compile again.
undefined says Which branch should I compile? The master or the newest release?
undefined says I recompile with the master branch but meet the same error
undefined says You should choose the branch with the latest release tag (currently v2.0.13).
undefined says Is there a way to archive transaction tracing information more than 128 blocks? I receive 'required historical state unavailable (reexec=128)' error when trace older than 128 blocks.
There is '--gcmode=archive' option in ETH node and is this option available in Arbitrum node?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-an-archive-node
undefined says I'm trying to connect to sequencer feed on Nova, documentation says that you should be able to use official rpc + /feed postfix, but it doesn't work for Nova. Works fine for Arbitrum One tho wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
could someone share feed endpoint for Nova?
undefined says My node is stucking with 98% memory usage (32G). And still it is rewinding for over 16 hours.  What is wrong?
undefined says Trying this.   Compile is failing....
undefined says My build script:  ```#!/bin/sh

set -e

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro.git
cd nitro
git checkout tags/v2.0.13
docker build -t nitro .```
undefined says It should be wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed , what error do you get?
undefined says Can you send your docker run command?
undefined says Did you try running `./build-brotli.sh -l` , as the warning message says?
undefined says `docker run -d -v ~/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.13-174496c --l1.url <My_Alchemy_URL>  --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain= --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*  --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"`

Actually I moved node to other location with synced database. I moved database to "~/data/arbitrum"  and executed above command.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says ❯ iocat wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed -v
> WSClient> constructor
WSClient> WSClient: url-> wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed
WSClient> onError Error: unexpected server response (400)
undefined says same within browser, you can connect to `new WebSocket('wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed')` but it doesn't connect to `nova`
undefined says :oldarbitrum:
undefined says I run it, then I re-run the `docker build -t nitro .` and it still fails.
undefined says It looks like the node is trying to recover from moving the database to a new location. I might take a while to get to a proper state and continue syncing from there. Can't give you an exact calculation though. Here's the error you're seeing and some scenarios on why this might have happened above that block => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/7ba109995c10d4397fea059939e808620bd5516a/core/blockchain.go#L368

Thanks for pointing out the RAM usage too.
undefined says I see. To effectively connect to the Sequencer's feed, you should do so through your node => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says what it the difference? Does it provide some special header or something like that? Why does it work for Arbitrum One and doesn't for Nova?
undefined says it works perfectly with feed relayer btw 👍
undefined says I'm not entirely sure, but I know connecting directly is not reliable and is heavily limited.
undefined says Glad to know it works 💪
undefined says Got it, thanks a lot for the help!
undefined says Make sure the submodules are correctly updated. And also, do you have the same result running `make docker` ?
undefined says I pull everything from scratch each time I run a build, so yes, submodules are updated.  `make docker` has same result.   This is working ok for you?
undefined says Can you tell me if this log is indicating that the name node has successfully started?
undefined says Answered at #🇨🇳︱中文技术频道
undefined says Mmmm, let me take a closer look at this, and I'll get back to you
undefined says You should update the submodules **after ** checking out the tag. Doing that works for me.
undefined says I just saw that was released v2.0.13 but I don't see any update in #💻︱dev-announcements
undefined says Ah, thanks for the hint.  Are the build instructions documented anywhere?  I could not find it.  This is what I got.  ```git clone --depth 1 --branch v2.0.13 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro.git
cd nitro
docker build -t nitro .```
undefined says We are still working on it. For now, we only have building instructions for debian => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/build-nitro-locally
undefined says I'm using above to build for debian actually.  Just run `docker cp $(docker run -it -d nitro):/usr/local/bin/nitro /usr/bin/nitro` to get the binary out, and then create a systemd unit.
undefined says I guess Step 2 should really suggest to checkout a specific tag rather than latest stuff.
undefined says Also please reference the build instructions from the github readme.
undefined says Thanks for the feedback @Matthew Darwin 💪  It will definitely help improve the instructions.
undefined says I get an error message "feedOneMsg failed to send message to execEngine err="wrong message number in digest got 1 expected 0"", I'm running node based on this guide https://stakesquid.notion.site/Arbitrum-Baremetal-Archive-Node-9078aadf5fa9463ab7a54961b75fad14 and node does not continue to sync. I tried reinstalling everything and downloading the latest version of Nitro and it didn't help.
undefined says My node is syncing past block data very slowly. Even, it is slower than new block generation of Arbitrum. What is the issue?
And, when I stop node, I faced the following message.
`Database compacting, degraded performance database=/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata`
What this means?
undefined says Restart it
undefined says It`s same.
undefined says i had this error and i could not resolve it.. i created other VM and started all over and now i do not have that problem
undefined says You too got same error
undefined says 
undefined says is it ok?
undefined says i was used this method https://github.com/thisislexar/Arbitrum-Full-Node/blob/main/arbitrumfullnodeEN.md
undefined says anyone know the url of the latest snapshot of the arbitrum full node?
undefined says has anyone tried running a node with an ethereum endpoint from providers like quicknode/infura? i read that i might reach some limits, but i am just running it to learn/play around, is the issue the amounts of requests or the general performance?
undefined says INFO [04-23|12:54:14.829] Opened ancient database                  database=/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/ancient/chain readonly=false
Usage of /usr/local/bin/nitro:
ERROR[04-23|12:54:14.832] error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
undefined says There is no data state on that dir, if you already have a database of arbitrum state, you might mount to a wrong point. If not, you need add --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says It should not cause rate limit in this case, do you use that l1 endpoint to do other things?
undefined says The sync speed depends on your network and disk, also, you might need use graceful shutdown next time when you shutdown your node, here is the commands: docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
undefined says You should checkout the branch to v2.0.13 and try
undefined says Hey im trying out a unreleased version that has the pruning PR that was merged last week and i am getting a scary message on startup:
undefined says 
undefined says Trying out the help command with geth i get:
undefined says 
undefined says Do i have to do anything once nitro is finished pruning?
undefined says 
undefined says tried renaming the tricache and restarting and this persists after pruning.
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs
undefined says Does anyone know of a grafana dashboard for nitro
undefined says Hey, I've got both an Arbitrum and Ethereum node completely synced, but I'm not sure how to find all the Arbitrum transaction info. Can you please help me?
undefined says what operating device are you currently making use of ?
Pc
Windows
iOS 
Android 
Mac
undefined says I am getting a 111 Connection Refused error on trying to connect to the IPC file via web3py.  Can anyone help with this? thanks.
undefined says when I try to connect with web3py IPCProvider, it gives me connection refused error. Not sure what I am doing wrong.
undefined says ` [Errno 111] Connection refused.`
undefined says a web3 http call to my local node RPC endpoint takes about 4-5 seconds, is there a way to speed it up. Shouldn't it be caching data at least a few latest blocks (I am using a nitro full node)? Thanks.
undefined says Are you still getting the errors
undefined says Yes, Still getting the same error.
undefined says did you tried reaching out to support @Ѕhаkіb or open a ticket
undefined says I am just starting with Arbitrum and I have a question regarding running a DAS node for production, I only see examples in kubernetes, I wanted to ask if it is the only recommended option for this
undefined says how long might it take to get a node synced from the seed database? I got my node up and it looks like it would take a week?.
undefined says Yes, almost around 5 to 7 days.
undefined says Did you set ipc.path and mount it to your host?
undefined says You can add `--graphql.enable` to your node, and use graphql to query the blocks with tx within them.
undefined says 
undefined says This is how my docker config volumes looks like
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks.
undefined says I am running on a centos system
undefined says Wouldn't that be too slow, considering I want to get all the historical txns?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs does the node support query pending state . for expample  . query the contract thought eth_call with tag (pending)
undefined says i got the l2msg is string like "AwAAAAAAAAPUBPkD0IMXXEmEBycOAIPLUk6UF3022+InGk3bKtgwTYJijrkh15CAuQNkJS97AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" but this util param is Uint8Array .
How should I convert this parameter？
undefined says My Arbitrum Classic archival node doesn't seem to start listening to its ports properly, can't `curl` or reach the ports in any way at all. I'm running the node in Ubuntu (not Docker) with settings

`--node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream --l1.url=<my L1> --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000 --node.rpc.addr="0.0.0.0" --node.rpc.port=8547 --node.rpc.tracing.enable --metrics --metrics-server.addr="0.0.0.0" --metrics-server.port="6070"`

I'm getting the log message `Last  valid database checkpoint,  total gas used: 94242532138470, L1 block: 15442605, L2 block: 22045628, ...` so database load from snapshot seems fine.

When I check active socket usage (`ss -lt`) the node is strangely missing. Have I missed some setting/action to make it start to listen to the ports?

Note: I have the same type of setup for the Nitro node and it hasn't shown any of these issues, so I'm quite sure it isn't anything to do with the environment.
undefined says does arbitrum provide binaries for nitro fullnode?
undefined says Dear Admin would like to seek your advise regarding of the validator node
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-validator
undefined says What is the minimum coin requirement? in order to become an active node
undefined says Technically we wish to run validator node and self delegate our own ARB
undefined says anyone able to connect to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed?
undefined says I'm interested in running a DAS node, the only option is kubernetes? Or would docker-compose also be viable? Thanks in advance
undefined says It’s base64, you need decode it first: https://cryptii.com/pipes/base64-to-hex
undefined says When your classic node is initializing, you might can’t connect it since it doesn’t start the service.
undefined says No, you might need to compile it your self: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says This is only used by fullnode to connect, directly connect will be rejected.
undefined says Yup, that is what we only provide now.
undefined says You can query block range rather than query block one by one.
undefined says where can i update offchainlabs pls?
undefined says just use docker to pull latest images is ok.
undefined says Dear Admin would like to seek your advise regarding of the validator node
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-validator
What is the minimum coin requirement? in order to become an active node
Technically we wish to run validator node and self delegate our own ARB
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Once transactions are sequenced, they run sequentially through state transition functions one after the other.   is  is any more api (http or wss) to  query the chain state from the sequencer?
undefined says Is that step supposed to take a long time?

It sends the `Last  valid database checkpoint ...` message and then does nothing more for ~4 hours and then closes down without giving any more output.

Edit: seems like I ran out of RAM and that's what killed the process. Hit the wall around ~30 GB. Is the initializing (from snapshot) expected to require this much RAM?

Edit 2: I found this thread, https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/1009193406326657035, which answers my first question at least 👍
undefined says Dear admin, may I seek your advise regarding this?
undefined says 大家好
undefined says sup guys
undefined says 
undefined says Is it normal?
undefined says It has been 3 days already
undefined says can i make it to catch the blockheight 😄
undefined says Is there any fast sync options like state file or sthng?
undefined says or checkpoints rather than downloading all blocks
undefined says You can initialize with the snapshots in the docs.  We just update the recent snapshot so that should get you close.
undefined says Hi, currently we don’t open registration, and the base stake amount is 1 ethers, you can query it here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35#readProxyContract.
undefined says Just the rpc, sequencer doesn’t do any state things, they just order the tx, and validator/fullnode can execute those ordered tx to get the state.
undefined says I see, we thought there is a validator slot that we could participate like ether and etc
undefined says Currently not, you can follow our twitter or medium, we will post there when we have updates on this.
undefined says Noted with thanks my sir @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says I got the error when run : ./test-node.bash --init
undefined says Error come to this step: Funding l2 funnel
undefined says 
undefined says Can you help me to check that? Which problem with that? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Even if i want, i cannot participate to validation. Why is that? Any medium article to read?
undefined says Sorry guys, I ve just joined here and still trying to explore
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-validator
undefined says You can only run watchTower validator, others validator needs whitelist.
undefined says watchTower does not validate or product blocks right?
undefined says How to get whitelist? Is there any incentive program or foundation support?
undefined says A Watchtower validator node produces blocks (locally), but does not post assertions on-chain: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-validator#types-of-validators
If it finds some discrepancy between its state and any posted assertion, it will log an error.

Validation is currently allowlisted, and this allowlist is governed by the DAO. You can see more information here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#2-validator-ownership
undefined says Thank you so much
undefined says Appreciate for your patience
undefined says where is located the sequencer node? In which area
undefined says Sequencer is located in the US
undefined says Thank you, does it make sense to place my node in the US too? for a faster tx submission
undefined says HAHAHA 
welcome me guys
undefined says finally catched
undefined says you did it !
undefined says 6 days
undefined says :arbijackhappy:
undefined says I just found this group, but I set up a node in under 2 hours with an incremental snapshot system I have in aws
undefined says Share some details pls
undefined says I didnt used snapshot btw. I downloaded all blocks. It is an archive node
undefined says we make/keep a collection of full/incremental snapshots on s3 to cut down on the time it takes to recover/setup our nodes.   I think its pretty easy to share synced disk templates / s3 files with other aws accounts, but haven't tried it yet.
undefined says hello! i have couple of noob questions
undefined says the sequencer is made of multiple nodes that follow the protocol, "stake" a bond that can be slash if they aggregate invalid transactions right?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says is there a dashboard where i can see how many nodes are running arbitrum nitro and other stats?
undefined says @Nico the support team will be able to help you out with that, did you reach out to them yet? and don’t accept any requests or messages from anyone
undefined says i'm mainly curious, i have heard that there are now decentralised sequencers being built by astria and espresso team
undefined says i get the shared sequencer part, but not the decentralised sequencer part
undefined says i'm not sure in what regard arbitrum is centralised if anyone can run a node
undefined says esp as the hardware requirements don't strike me as "high"
undefined says oh i assume the sequencer is indeed centralised and running somewhere at arbitrum cloud providers
undefined says full nodes, archive nodes, local nodes, validators etc ... aren't helping sequence anything
undefined says they are just here to help with verification and propagation of data
undefined says is that a fair statement?
undefined says What’s the issue you’re facing
undefined says @Muhtar 【Ø】 Thor Labs would you be able to tell me ?
undefined says sorry to quote answer you, idk who to ask the question to
undefined says i saw you help someone above so i took the liberty to reach out
undefined says Bro as i read in docs, yes. I am arbitrum noob too. I m here for just 1 week. Still trying to learn lots of stuff
undefined says The fullnode can help user forward tx to sequencer and also get new feeds from sequencer then calculate the state to provide user query. Validator can stake to propose rblock which is used to let l1’s contract knows l2’s state so the bridge can work correctly.
undefined says Where are the sequencer servers located? Which DCs?
undefined says Possibility for a new snapshot anytime soon?
undefined says It is a secret ser
undefined says Why
undefined says how old is the current snapshot ?
undefined says i think around november
undefined says you mean nitro-recent ?
undefined says Too old :( takes way too long to sync
undefined says my node took only 3 days to sync
undefined says Oh
undefined says Maybe I should take a look, mine took ages but maybe it was the machine
undefined says ssd?
undefined says Yeh amazon gp3
undefined says Guess I should have gone with io1/2
undefined says How are you launching the node? I've got fiber, latest release, NVMe drive etc. and it takes about 3 weeks to sync
undefined says Am I using some wrong commands or wtf. HW does not explain this difference.
undefined says hey guys, is it normal that after first starting my node and providing it the unzipped tar snapshot, it just spits out `InboxTracker` logs for that last 6 hrs or so
undefined says it looks like it's increasing the number of l1 blocks i guess
undefined says but what exactly is it doing (since im using an l1 rpc)
undefined says oh i guess it's grabbing all the l1 transactions at each block...
undefined says all good, it started producing blocks
undefined says looks like it's creating at a rate of 200k blocks /hour. does that seem reasonable/ good io on my disk>?
undefined says Did exactly this but still having the same error `"no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"`
undefined says Solved - nitro-pruned.tar should be extracted to `/some/local/dir/arbitrum/arb1/` instead of `/some/local/dir/arbitrum/`
undefined says my node suddenly have a hardfork? why the blockHash that my node receives can not find in the arbiscan?
undefined says just like the block 85891943, i got the blockHash `0xeb6794a07c105f0175ce4161639b6755db66cb21aece456db6b3e91be846e55d`, but actually `0x6c057036a13ff3a553b6af9ff3ddfb0cb52d031b0759dc1c762348bad0f3ef1d`
undefined says did you tried to reach out to support @Ѕhаkіb
undefined says I have a problem to launch the node
````
ERROR[04-30|20:10:17.572] error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
```
 
Do you have an idea how to solve it?
this happens after downloading the archive
undefined says See if you can find "arb1" folder, empty it and extract the archive there
undefined says it doesn't change anything for me :/
undefined says Now, I am using the command from the doc and now i have this error
```
Notice: error creating ArbStorage /home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet/db
```
undefined says also had this issue and fixed it
undefined says the node does not extract properly have to do it manually
undefined says how are ya'll benchmarking the speed for local node? it seems like mine is no faster than infura/alchemy...
undefined says surely its based on hardware since they are running the same binary
undefined says i guess you're right.... im going to try some better hardware..
undefined says (better instance type/ssd)
undefined says you'd want high iops nvme
undefined says Yup
undefined says ya Im going to try mc5.4xlarge + io1 SSD on aws
undefined says i just started syncing the node after unzipping the tar and am getting this however 🤔
undefined says constant  "Resuming state snapshot generation" and "Aborting state snapshot generation" and then resume again, not sure why...
undefined says overall eta of snapshot generation is going down/storage going up so gonna leave it be fore now...
undefined says That’s expected
undefined says ah cool, good to know fren ❤️
undefined says oddly didn't happen to me at all a few days ago setting up the first node on google cloud
undefined says @Raikas poika mikko has your node finally synced?
undefined says btw just a heads up for anyone doing this, use `https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar` it's up to 4/20/23
undefined says 
undefined says my another node hardfork with no reason...
undefined says the above  one is the normal one, but the below one the receipts are different... what's happend.
undefined says Please help to fix this issue.
undefined says 
undefined says sorry to bother. I am curious. Do I need to have my own ethereum node in order to sync a arbitrum node? or is a public RPC node enough? Thank you! 🙂
undefined says or possibly a free tier alchemy node?
undefined says @everyone
Please help me to fix this issue to run Arbitrum Nitro Node.
undefined says how do i raise a support ticket
undefined says WHAT IS YOUR ISSUE?
undefined says does anyone know where I can buy aicode?
undefined says I think that error is the node  looking for the tarball it downloads with --init=URL because theres no blockchain data to be found where its looking in the container and no directions
undefined says hmmm, how to fix it?
undefined says are you mounting a volume into the container for the data ?  It might be a wrong path and the data isn't mounted at the intended location or the wrong folder is mounted in the correct location 
--
I started my nodes with init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says we are amazon curious.  If you would like to try bringing up a node from a synced disk snapshot or s3 download from a synced disk and reverse the charges
undefined says we have nodes in our physical control to send disks back and forth too to get people synced fast.
undefined says Since a few months archival nodes increase in size extremely fast. If this pace continues it's going to be unfeasible to host archival nodes in about 1 year or earlier. Is there anything you do about this? One option would be to build around erigon as the disk efficiency with erigon is significantly better and would likely reduce the storage usage by at least 60-70% right now and even more if it fills up.
undefined says Another option would be to retire old blocks into a more efficient database that is slower to read from (that's what erigon does internally)
undefined says For us as node operators it's crucial to host archival nodes. The industry needs it, developers want it and projects depend on it. I think more effort should be put towards keeping archival nodes realistic in size before Arbitrum nodes end up in a BSC-like state where it's close to impossible to host archival data and nobody does it
undefined says Right now the footprint is ~3.7 TB. With erigon this could easily be reduced to ~1-2 TB. If you compare this with Polygon, you would be able to fit the archival Arbitrum node into a 8 TB NVME for the next 2-3 years at least. At that point 16 TB NVMEs will be generally available and as cheap as 8 TB is today
undefined says Chainnodes would be happy to partner with Arbitrum to implement an erigon node integration for Arbitrum One. Who would be the right person to speak to?
undefined says Is there a deployment script for orbit l3?
undefined says I am sorry, but can't find any info related to my question. Is it possible to earn fee rewards by running the node? And are there any revenue possibilities for node runners?

Thank you!
undefined says my nodes hardfork again. this time, two of my nodes hardfork.
undefined says what versions  are your nodes running on l1 and arb ?
undefined says Dumb question but why do I even need to run a node? Why can't I just submit transactions straight to the sequencer?
undefined says Not a dumb question! We don't offer direct connections to the sequencer to prevent the sequencer from being overloaded w bad requests.
undefined says Hey, there is no such rewards. But you will certainly get rewards if there is ever a dispute in which you win.
undefined says You could get in touch w our partnerships at partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Not yet, but our team is actively working on it
undefined says any hints for the following error? 
ERROR[05-03|06:48:59.509] error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"

Currently trying to run a whitelisted validator with the following docker command: docker run -d -v /home/asterix/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.13-174496c --l1.url=xxxxx --l2.chain-id=42161 --init.force --node.staker.enable --node.staker.strategy=Defensive --l1.wallet.password="xxx"
undefined says Does an arbitrum nitro node  prune itself, or do we have to stop and prune like ethereum and polygon pos ?
undefined says 
undefined says I got there error showing on my node logs

```

```

is it fine ?
and how to fix it ?
undefined says nitro build from source code.
undefined says It’s ok, there is a bug around our charging code, we will fix it in the future version.
undefined says You need update your node to offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834, we support offline pruning that version.
undefined says how to prune with v2.0.14? any command example?
undefined says -- init.prune  （full" for full nodes serving RPC requests, or "validator" for validators）
undefined says What service providers do you use for your nodes? Do you have any recommendations?
undefined says No strong recommendations, but you can find a list of rpc providers that support Arbitrum networks here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says May I ask which region's computer room is the centralized sequencer rpc service in? I need to deploy a node in the nearest computer room
undefined says Which US state computer room is the sequencer node in?
undefined says We can only disclose that it is in the US
undefined says 🖖   This is Axel from BLOCKSIZE; seasoned Chainlink Node Operator running a couple of  Arbitrum- one nodes.

We'd be eager to whitelist and transmogrify these nodes which we are already operating for more than half a year into staked validators. Please let me know what is the whitelisting procedure  ✌️
undefined says Allowlist of node validators is currently managed by the DAO => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#2-validator-ownership
undefined says help me
undefined says 
undefined says It looks like there are a few  '/' missing in the --init.url param
Should be something like: `--init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar"`

Also, I think you don't need to mount the second volume jira/arbitrum
undefined says I am following https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/build-nitro-locally. Where are the binaries saved after the make command? I am having trouble finding them

undefined says No, I want to check if your node download that snapshot correctly.
undefined says Tanks🫰
undefined says OK, I will join their Discord and ask them
undefined says Unable to start an archive node, stuck at following error.
undefined says Could someone suggest the resolution
undefined says currently we are running our project on goerli arbitrum and out of eth to test, can we run a validator node and then get more eth to help our user on testing before going to mainnet? many thanks.
undefined says Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Atlanta, which computer room is more suitable for building nodes?
undefined says me too，This should be a bug.
undefined says Discord is this one, but it's just not the right channel.
In any case, the forum is probably the best place to ask about that => https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/
But I can tell you that it will require a DAO proposal to be voted on and passed to modify the current list of validators.
undefined says Can you try with this snapshot? 
https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-genesis.tar
(The previous URL is redirecting there)

undefined says Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Atlanta, which computer room is more suitable for building nodes?
undefined says But I dont have any docker images after the make command
undefined says 
undefined says 同样的报错，没有效果
undefined says Same error, no effect
undefined says `mv /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/* /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1` should fix it
undefined says are you trying to use docker or run on bare metal ?
undefined says I am just trying to build from source and run for some tests
undefined says Thanks for your response but the status remains same with the updated url as well.
undefined says In my case it shows path as `database=/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata` shouldn't it be like `database=/home/ubuntu/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata`
undefined says Oh, I missed the mounting point:
-v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum:/home/ubuntu/.arbitrum

First part is a local dir in your machine, and second part must be `/home/user/.arbitrum` (the word "user", not a real username)
undefined says Any reason to prune on archive nodes? Or I assume it will just still save everything (nothing to prune)?
undefined says :oldarbitrum:
undefined says Tried to chuck this in #📬︱support but didn't get much help, appears I was maybe in the wrong area! Anyone able to give me a hand?

I am trying to setup an Arbitrum Nova node but running into a:

 it seems to be working, but all eth_call rpc calls returns "0x" and it stops by it self after a couple of hours
 
 What is wrong with this setup ?
undefined says Still syncing is my guess
undefined says Then, why it closes by it self without an error message i can see ?
undefined says Did you fully sync the node.
undefined says Check your system log and see if there is OOM errors.
undefined says Is restarting works?
undefined says Seems this is the first time you start 42161 node, you need set --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" rather than init.prune
undefined says Yes it did. Thank you.
undefined says this is my first time trying to run Arbitrum node, but I am running BSC nodes. I was doing a bit of poking around, and I cannot find config.toml which both BSC and GETH use, as well as any info on bootstrap nodes. Can someone please help?
undefined says What wallet are you making use of ?
undefined says I don't have wallet yet 😅  why do I need wallet just to run node?
undefined says I used Uniswap to swap from Arbitrum One to gETH but it didn't reflect on my gETH on ETH network and neither did it reflect in Arbitrum Goerli...how do I solve the problem?

I need gETH on ETH network
undefined says I've been trying to set up an arbitrum node for like a week now. For some reason I keep getting the same error which is `"no --init.*`. I have tried many different directories & permissions but always end up with the same error and it's very puzzling. It seems like I am not the only one with these issues, I've tried searching on github & discord but I can't seem to find a solid answer on what's causing it. can someone please help me set up my node? Here is the docker command I am using: ```docker run --rm -it -v /data/arbitrum:/home/x/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --l2.chain-id=42161 --init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*```
undefined says I have a question with setting up local dev node.
If I want to set up local dev node for test, should I set up sequencer, validator, batch-poster all ?
And is there any hardware requirement for them?
undefined says Same here. Seeing this error.
undefined says You mean every time you restart the node it will redownload the files? Or it will just throw `no init.*` and shutdown?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node
undefined says I see your docker mount point should be /home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says I had done it with the download and without the prune and got the same error. Running it again with the download now, I'll let you know the results.
undefined says docker run  --rm -it -v /root/data/arb:/root/data/arb/.arbitrum/mainnet   --network host   -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url=http://127.0.0.1:1545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*     --init.url="file:/root/data/arb/nitro.tar"  --node.rpc.tx-fee-cap=0 --node.rpc.gas-cap=0
undefined says How to specify database to a specified directory

```
undefined says This is usually because the snapshot file isn't mounted to your Docker container. Mount it and change the file path to your Docker container’s mount point.
undefined says i got the same problem
undefined says No it hasn’t. What do I do please?
undefined says I've triple checked the path I'm passing in the run command.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/issues/2603
undefined says That looks promising, I'll have to give it a try tomorrow. Thanks for the help!
undefined says Yeah,  I mean /root/data/arb/nitro.tar is your host’s dir, you should mount this to your docker, and change that init.url to that mounted point. In your case, you should set -v /root/data/arb/: /home/user/.arbitrum and --init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar"   And I saw your docker mount point also wrong, so that might be the reason you run into that issue.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  can you please let me know how to run nitro (compiled locally) directly without using docker? Thanks!
undefined says How long will it take me to synchronize blocks？Is there any other snapshot download, quick sync
undefined says .
undefined says any idea why i am getting this?
undefined says ```ERROR[05-09|13:41:00.063] error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"```
undefined says i have files in "root@Debian-1106-bullseye-amd64-base /home/root/arbitrum-node/data/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/ancient/chain
undefined says 
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/issues/2603
undefined says this helped. thanks
undefined says I was able to fix it in the following steps:
- wget the snapshot
- unzip the snapshot and move everything to /data/arbitrum/arb1/ by running -> sudo tar xf nitro.tar --directory /data/arbitrum/arb1/
- re-run the docker command without the "--init.url" flag
undefined says Seems similar to the solution provided earlier, but doesn't require starting the node and failing it.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I've given what you said a shot but still have the same issue, here is my what i used: ```docker run --rm -it -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --l2.chain-id=42161 --init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*
```
undefined says ill try what you said glock 😄
undefined says does anyone have an approx ETA to sync from snapshot?
undefined says NVMe 4ghz
undefined says I set up nodes from our internal snapshots in about 1.5 -2 hours from 0 to synced.  I haven't tried the official snapshots. I think these are easy to share with s3 in my aws zone.
undefined says lol so what @jmcglock suggested worked perfectly. There's something seriously wrong with the docker files & quick start provided by arbitrum, I've battled this for days with no success until I manually unzipped the tar file myself. I recommend anyone else having the `no --init.*` error to follow the guide above
undefined says we are aware of the issue and is working on making a proper tar file avaliable
undefined says how can i solve the --init error now?
undefined says people are saying to download the tarball and manually unpack it to the right directory
undefined says interesting. then the hosted snapshot is quite old.. i am now here after several hours ` l2Block=24,459,382`
undefined says so will take several days at this speed
undefined says nitro.tar is expected to only contain nitro genesis
undefined says if anyone can push a new tar or share a link would be greatly appreciated
undefined says never mind i synced from genesis
undefined says how?
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html
undefined says This worked for me after doing some chmod to get everything right. Thanks for your help!
undefined says can anyone suggest what information should be displayed on localhost:8548 . I thought that the websocket would be available, but I have an empty page. At the same time in the logs I see that the node is synchronized.
undefined says No problem. Glad I could help.
undefined says can't find right directory😔
undefined says 
undefined says please help
undefined says 
undefined says 😴
undefined says On the top left image, it shows the path to arbitrum/arb1 in the top location bar. Go to the folder arbitrum (one folder back) and hold shift and right click the location bar over the word arbitrum and select copy address as text. (you might not have to click shift, not sure where i remember that from) Then go to your docker command and remove the part that says ~/data/arbitrum and paste your new path there. Leave everything else as is.
undefined says I did it on Ubuntu so idk if it will work
undefined says But that's the only thing I notice
undefined says you might have to ask one of the devs about the `/home/user/.arbitrum` part on windows, it most likely has a different path it wants you to point to on a windows machine
undefined says devs are you here?
undefined says can you give path for windows?
undefined says Is there any hosted archive nodes available for testing?
undefined says What is current size of ARB chain (Not including ETH data)
undefined says I having trouble connecting l1, does anyone have a simple fix? I’m not able to get up of container.
undefined says l1 says connection refused
undefined says I’m not able to get ip of the container. I’m running l1 and l2 on same device
undefined says Note that if you are running L1 node on localhost, you may need to add --network host right after docker run to use docker host-based networking
undefined says https://mirror.xyz/0xf3bF9DDbA413825E5DdF92D15b09C2AbD8d190dd/i4OnpBFIJUKA6z_pqN2gu2zst2MUaHOqrxSX4vCW9cM
undefined says I followed this one. There is no docker run on the composer but they do have —network host in composer
undefined says services:
    nitro-node:
        network_mode: host
undefined says Yes, did you add this?
undefined says has anyone run node on windows?
undefined says no result)) cant find right path
undefined says gn fellas

I just synced my arbitrum node and it randomly stopped due to sigint (not sure where the sigint came from as it wasn't something I manually actioned) and did not restart automatically.

Being not very familiar with docker, could anyone point me in the direction of how I might be able to ensure the node restarts if it fails in the future?
undefined says Is there a doc for running a goerli node? i changed the listening port in the docker compose but it still tries to use the nitro port which is blocked by the mainnet node
undefined says What does prune will do? Decrease db size? In which way?
undefined says open ticket @dao
undefined says Hlw my dear never
undefined says @dao
undefined says Yes
undefined says admin please help me
undefined says can't run node on windows
undefined says 
undefined says in windows works on their own container and i don't know how to copy db
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st
undefined says Same problem at linux too  need help  😢
undefined says 😭
undefined says just untar the archive manually and remove the init flag from the compose file
undefined says it was packed wrongly so that its extracted to nitro/nitro/ instead of just nitro
undefined says so it doesnt find the files
undefined says can you give me path where i need to extract the
?
in windows
undefined says work for me too love u
undefined says can anyone give correct nitro.tar url ?
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says the same))
undefined says How old is that one?
undefined says 04-24-2023  15 days
undefined says thanks!
undefined says Yes I added that
undefined says am i ok to assume that i can run my nitro node with only 1 of the 2 mainnets? That is to say, only run with arbitrum Nova and not with arbitrum One?
undefined says Yes mate
undefined says Thanks! It is running on Nova now
undefined says I was getting some RPC errors yesterday:
{'code': -32000, 'message': 'max fee per gas less than block base fee: address ..., maxFeePerGas: 100000000 baseFee: 526420000'}

I thought baseFee was fixed at 0.1gwei? I set the baseFee higher and my transactions got through, but still only paid 0.1gwei for baseFee. Not sure if this is intended RPC behaviour or a bug?
undefined says you can set basefee  5Gwei or more . only payed  the block base fee
undefined says Yeah that fixed it, but I'm still only paying 0.1gwei on chain. I thought 0.1gwei baseFee was supposed to be constant?
undefined says 0.1 gwei is lowest fee .
undefined says so the base fee can be higher?
undefined says Yes definitely
undefined says If you're still having troubles with this, can you send the full docker run command you're using?
undefined says I would recommend you find out the cause of the crash in your OS logs. In any case, docker provides a restart param that you can use in your docker run command: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/
undefined says You should be able to run a goerli node by using the regular guide ( https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node ) and changing the l1.url and l2.chainid parameters . If you're still having troubles, please send the full command you're using to take a look
undefined says Pruning erases old data from the db
undefined says so just start it with --init-prune "full" ?
undefined says `--init.prune=full` should be good
undefined says perfect thank you
undefined says I would suggest you try with a docker run command first. Once your L1 is running, use this guide for your L2 node => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
If you have troubles setting that up, you can use this troubleshooting guide and ask us => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
Once you have that running, you can move to the docker-compose version that external article uses.
undefined says How long does it take?
undefined says What do you mean by direct connections? If I run a relay it must be able to connect to the sequencer to read its feed somehow?
undefined says #!/bin/bash


docker run -d -v arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548  offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url https://mainnet.chainnodes.org/c96c95b2-a397-47d4-a5e5-0134b --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar

undefined says You can connect to the Sequencer's feed to receive its messages, but you can't send transactions directly to the Sequencer. Instead, you must send them through a node which will forward them to the Sequencer. That node can be selfhosted or hosted by a third party provider.
undefined says Try using a full path for the first part of the -v param (currently "arbitrum"). Also, try using this URL as the init.url =>  https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-genesis.tar (the one you are using redirects to this one anyway, but let's use the final url first).

Paste the latest log messages you get when you try that, please
undefined says Hey There!
Currently how many validators are running for Arbitrum Nova
undefined says That feed for Arbitrum One is wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed, right? Does this feed come directly from the sequencer or are there also relay nodes between the actual sequencer and the client that connects to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed ?
undefined says #!/bin/bash

undefined says 8 whitelisted validator nodes: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses#mainnet-arbitrum-nova
undefined says It comes directly from the Sequencer, but it is recommended to always relay those messages through your own relayer and read from there.
undefined says manual extract + full path  works for me thanks))
undefined says I see thank you for the clarification! So only the RPC messages that clients send towards the sequencer (at https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc) go through relays to prevent the sequencer from getting directly spammed, makes sense. Is there any info about these relays? Like how many there are, how they are load balanced to prevent spamming, etc.?
undefined says I'm going through a bunch of blocks now using an archive node, there are no blocks with a gas fee higher than 0.1 as far as I can see, you sure this isn't a Nitro bug?
undefined says Relayers only relay messages from the Sequencer's feed => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed (this feed publishes messages whenever a Sequencer processes a transaction from its queue)

RPC messages are sent to nodes, which then forward them to the Sequencer's Inbox. You can read more about the tx lifecycle here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle (it starts from the moment the Sequencer receives a transaction from a node)
undefined says do you know how to parse the messages?
undefined says no
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says how to parse the sequencer-feed messages?
undefined says We don't support retrieving or parsing the sequencer feed messages outside of the node software.
undefined says Who runs these nodes? All controlled/permissioned by Offchain Labs?
undefined says Thanks for the new offline pruning mode, saved a ton of disk space on my nodes.  Is there any advantage to running the prune on archive nodes, or am I right in assuming there wouldn't really be anything to prune on archives?
undefined says Not sure if there's things that can be compacted, or mid-states that are thrown away or something like that.  Or if it would just look through everything and go "yeah, we have all the data, and want all the data..."
undefined says There shouldn't be any benefits to pruning an archive snapshot
undefined says Does anyone have an experience building a node from the source code?
undefined says Thats what I figured, thanks for confirming!
undefined says How much space are people's archive nitro node consuming? I just ran out of space on my 3.5 tb drive 😰
undefined says And is there a way to split the data between different drives?
undefined says Anyone can run a node to handle rpc requests. There are instructions in the docs to do so => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
And you can also find some node providers in the portal => https://portal.arbitrum.io/one?categories=node-provider

Currently whitelisted are the validator nodes (nodes that assert the current state of the chain into L1) => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#2-validator-ownership
undefined says You can ask here if you have any doubts. I recently did some test builds on Ubuntu, following the instructions available for Debian => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/build-nitro-locally
undefined says What I meant was specifically regarding the actual central sequencer server. I am referring to the information that it is not possible to directly connect to the sequencer via RPC. Instead the https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc endpoint connects to nodes that forward RPC requests to the centralized sequencer (e.g. when broadcasting a new transaction). This means the nodes that stand in between the https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc endpoint and the sequencer must also be controlled by Offchain Labs, since these nodes must be allowed to connect *directly* to the indexer. I am interested to know more about exactly these nodes. How many are there, are they load balanced, etc?
undefined says Keep in mind that archive nodes take up a lot of space and they grow at a much higher rate than regular full nodes. 3-3.5TB sounds about right for an archive nitro node.
undefined says The endpoint you are referring to ( https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc ) is Arbitrum's public RPC. It works just like any other node run by users, node providers, ...: you can send RPC requests there. Transactions then go from those nodes to the Sequencer, and are placed in a queue for it to process them.
Once the Sequencer processes a transaction, it publishes a new message in its feed ( wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed ) which can be read by anyone connected to that feed.

To sum up, there isn't anything else between Arbitrum's public RPC and the Sequencer. And anyone can run their own node (instead of using Arbitrum's public one) which will service RPC and sends transactions to the Sequencer, so their transactions will go from their own node to the Sequencer.

Does that help?

undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs can you help?
undefined says That does help, thanks for bearing with me as I wrap my head around this. Ok, so if I run a full node that node will directly connect to the sequencer for things like submitting new transactions. How is that connection to the sequencer established?
undefined says Can you try adding `--node.staker.enable=false` . It looks like that param needs to be set to false for now.
undefined says gotcha, is there a way to use multiple drives to split the disk space requirements?
undefined says There isn't currently
undefined says thanks
undefined says Or, even better, try with `--init.prune=validator`
undefined says I'm trying to split out ancient data on my newer snapshots to see if I can run the ancient data on the much cheaper aws hdd tier,  but haven't tried running a node like this yet.
undefined says Ah ok. Is there any unofficial way to try and do it myself? I'm also happy to help contribute to try and add this feature because I think the state growth is making it increasingly difficult to run an archive node. Splitting ancient data, like geth, could be a really helpful feature
undefined says Very interesting, how are you splitting out the ancient data?
undefined says there is an ancient directory thats 20%+ of the chaindata,  I'm going to sync it to a slower disk and mount it at ...arbitrumpath/arbi1/nitro/l2chaindata/ancient
undefined says how are you syncing it? using a symbolic link or something?
undefined says I'll stop a synced node and make a read only snapshot to copy,  but theres a prune command that I'm waiting for because I might as well start the new setup from a pruned node.
undefined says can you help me i want to run a node for arbitrum but i don't know how to do it?
undefined says Hey guys! I'm confused by a proposal post in the official discourse forum. I assume that this person doesn't understand how Arbitrum works and is talking about Ethereum gas fees. But to be sure: Is Arbitrum now charging any extra fee for Arb node validators, and is that what he means? Thanks for any clarification. Cheers!

I found this error is from redis. But I don't know why this happend. 
And I think because redis master restarted from replica, sequence should reconnect redis but error is continue.
Why does this happen and what should I do?
undefined says My node is not connecting to feed. Why?  I opened ports - 8547, 8548, 9642
undefined says What means?  I used the following command

undefined says Is running a node locally faster than docker ? In terms of receiving / sending data
undefined says Could you see your redis container live or not?
undefined says It reported 429 error code means too many requests, did you run more than one node in the same IP address? If so, you might need run your own feed node and connect to it: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-feed-relay

undefined says I want to run a node just to use it to execute my personal trading smart contract, please it is compulsory to run a full node? or is they any type i can run that will also work normally to execute my contract transaction?
undefined says there are lots of RPC access providers,  but for running trading you might need to be as fast as affordable for competitive reasons.
undefined says arbitrum is one of the easier nodes to run,  its a great place to start if you have code you are excited to run and space for the node on your systems.

Unexpected output: `web3.eth.getBlockNumber().then(console.log)` the result of getBlockNumber is OK and exactly as same as from arbiscan, but
when I execute `web3.eth.getBalance("0x6****2C3").then(console.log)` the result is zero, no matter what address I give. The node version is offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 and the RPC parameters are all set.
undefined says hey guys, running into the same issue as this:
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/996082854851252234

I'm in kubernetes and whenever I need to restart the node to update settings it does indeed take a long time to restart because it's repairing the state after what seems to be an unclean shutdown.

I allowed a longer grace period (6 minutes) to give it time to respond to the TERM signal, but it never seems to respond and kubernetes kills the pod, resulting in the corrupted state. At this point I'm 80% sure this is what's happening but don't know what to do. The docs say using `docker stop` is the correct way to shutdown and that also just sends the TERM signal so this should work for kubernetes as well.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
Additional details: I was using the helm chart from the graphops repo which uses node version v2.0.10-73224e3.
https://github.com/graphops/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/arbitrum-nitro
I just updated to v2.0.14-2baa834 but haven't tested terminating the node yet
undefined says These 100% seems like an IOPs problem that the process is taking way to long to exit and you are killing it anyway. I am running docker with systemd with a timeout of 2 minutes and can restart my process over and over and it starts syncing in seconds
undefined says Do you have a suggestion to fix that?
undefined says Im looking at the metrics and it doesnt look like disk write operations are spiking
undefined says So not sure how else to test this
undefined says Also the node never stops syncing transactions which feels strange to me also but not sure how it works internally
undefined says I am not familiar with modern kubernetes, but in your pod there might be a termination grace period setting that you can put to something like 10000, and give the node time to sync that state data before shutting down.
undefined says i set the grace period to 360 (so 6 minutes), the fact that it takes that long suggest something is wrong. It seems like it never terminates, and continues to sync the whole time
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1108095692016193546
undefined says 3 Main options:
1. re-init the entire testnode (run with --init), this will delete any previous data
2. Try to write priorities to redis. We don't really debug test-node but it can be done with: docker-compose run testnode-scripts redis-init --redundancy
3. you can run testnode without redis at all - if you don't try to run multiple sequencers etc (which is really only useful for us), turn off seq with something like --node.seq-coordinator.enabled=false
Last needs to be added to any node using sequencer_config.json or poster_config.json
undefined says Thank you. I'll try it. 🙂
undefined says Hey yall, I posted a question on #📬︱support , but seems like there'll be more help here.

I'm trying to run the Nitro node for the first time, and I'm kinda stuck.
- eth_syncing returns false, so should be ready to use
- but eth_blockNumber returns something around 69,000,000
- eth_getBlockByNumber gives me hashes and everything, but those hashes doesn't match any data on Arbiscan 
- I'm using chain id 42161, and I checked the block number+hashes on arbitrum nova and goerli just in case, and still got nothing
- The log mostly says "created block"
undefined says Did I fork by accident..? Any and all help welcome
undefined says I am running arbitrum-nitro node with archive enabled, but the issue is that I lose eth_logs data, and my subgraphs stop working. It seems like the nitro node keeps eth_log data for a few blocks. How can I set the number of blocks to keep the eth_log data?
undefined says Send me the copy of the issue you are getting @tanujsoni
undefined says To run a node, on your website https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node it says the command is: "docker run ... offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 ..."  The problem is the "nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834" changes as you make updates.  How can I put this into cron so that this part is variable and fetched on the Internet?  I used this curl command months ago and it stopped working due to your Cloudflare which blocks the curl from getting the page data [ curl https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node 2>> /dev/null | tr '<>' '\012' | grep '^offchainlabs/nitro-node:' ]
undefined says 
undefined says being able to subscribe to a release notification that gives the latest  version, stable version,  previous version etc would make it a lot easier to miss a hardfork
undefined says I need something that works in a shell script though so it's entirely automated.  Ideally it will just be an alias like "offchainlabs/nitro-node:LATEST" which will link to the actual release.  Could be multiple aliases too for stable, previous, etc.
undefined says I think you need to figure out what the node is doing while you are shutting it down. If its still running node operations while you are shutting down then you need to see why its so slow. My guess is IOPS since this is using geth and level db under the hood.
undefined says latest is mostly unstable,  I think "stable"  is a good word for the official supported release for nodes that need to be online.
undefined says can anyone tell me how much disk space a Arbitrum archive node size is today ?
undefined says I tried to run it with "offchainlabs/nitro-node:stable" in the command and it has an error.  It only works if I specify the exact version like this: offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 but I need something generic since it is written in the cronjob script and I don't want to keep changing the script on every reboot
undefined says There's an assumption baked in here that the node is actually trying to shutdown, but I don't know if that's actually the case. Which is why I'm asking for more details or if there is a way to check that it's actually shutting down, i.e some metrics I can look at, some process that begins etc. It _could_ be IOPS but all other node operations are also writing to disk and I'm seeing no increase there. 

So not receiving the shutdown signal feels more plausible.
undefined says I figured out a way to test though so I'll report back later
undefined says i have the same error as you using the mirror guide, did you find a solution?
undefined says 
undefined says I tried what you sugguested, but I got some issues.
option 2. In "test-node.bash", redis initialize like image1.
Is this different from what you said?
option 3. I added seq-coordinator enabled false, but there were some errors.
1) sequencer : I got error like image2, so I had to add dangerous.no-coordinator option.
2) batch-poster : When I sendtransaction to L2, nothing happen. I think this is because of coordinator. But I can't find option related this.
What should I do?
undefined says Oh, does option2 works? If not, generally - we will much recommend re-init the test node, 2 and 3 are just alternates
undefined says Oh, I mean that code in "test-node.bash" is originally like that. And I always did re-init for test node.
undefined says I am synchronizing my arb node at the moment. Is there a command to check which block it is doing to get information how long it will need?
undefined says you can check the logs or query eth_syncing
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#how-can-i-verify-that-my-node-is-syncing-at-a-desirable-speed
undefined says I run The Graph node for GMX Subgraph, but if at some point graph node becomes unavailable and tries to catchup with old blocks, we start getting this error

```
"error":{"code":-32043,"message":"Requested data is not available"}
```

I can replicate same with curl

```
❯ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{}],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'  https://hosted_at_my_server
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32043,"message":"Requested data is not available"}}%

```
undefined says 1. Does the nitro node keep historical eth_getLogs?
2. Does it prune historical eth_getLogs logs after certain blocks?
3. What is it can I do to keep more logs so I can sync my subgraphs starting with 50 million blocks?
undefined says I have tried this with two archive nodes that I am running on my own
undefined says Hey!
If I understand correctly, you're getting this error also when querying a node you're running? If so, is your L1 node running correctly and fully synced? And also your L2 node?
What command did you use to run your L2 node?
undefined says heyyy
Small question, I have a full eth node with geth and prysm. 
Regarding the l1.url flag of docker run for arbitrum, is it possible to put the ipc of my node? example:
l1.url /root/ethereum/geth.ipc
or the ws: 
l1.url ws://localhost:8546
or can i only put in http?
thanks
undefined says You can also use ws. As for IPC, it should work, but you'll need to bind mount it into docker, and I believe it is only supported on Linux.
undefined says I'm on Ubuntu, do you know how I can do this?  I don't really know how to do it
undefined says Going to attempt to run a node on windows, wish me luck. Hopefuly with ws2l itll help
undefined says You need put your l1 ipc file to your docker mount point (for example, you must type -v your_local_dir:/home/user/.arbitrum, that your_local_dir is the dir you need put to), then tell your docker the your l1 url is /home/user/.arbitrum/your_ipc_name
undefined says Maybe this issue occured, because I set all of port from "127.0.0.1" to "0.0.0.0" in docker-compose.yaml for rpc test from external server so some other user accessed redis. I think this is solved by setting redis port to default
Thank you for your help!
undefined says 
undefined says Yes, I host my nodes and get this error on my nodes only. I tried the same on Alchemy; it works fine on Alchemy nodes but not with my nodes.

Yes, My L1 node is running perfectly and is synced completely and properly (I host my own Ethereum Archive nodes using Erigon)
undefined says 
undefined says The command I use to run nitro node
undefined says I am using contabo, I think this node service is too slow to run a node. Can that be an issue?
undefined says If yes, what service are u guys using and what are u paying?
undefined says Or could that be an issue with the Eth node from alchemy?
undefined says In your command, I see you initiated your node with the snapshot "nitro-pruned.tar" . If that's the case, you won't have historical data up to the point that snapshot was taken (around April, 20th). For a full archive node, you must sync your node from the beginning using "nitro-genesis.tar" with the --node.caching.archive flag active since the moment the node starts syncing.
undefined says It depends on the specs of your infra and the type of node you're trying to run. You can see here the minimum specs for a full node and compare it with you current node => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration
undefined says Where can I find the genesis tar?
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-genesis.tar
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs  I want to run a full node to monitor the latest transactions with the minimum delay time, where should I put the node? America or Europe? Or put it in the place closest to the sequencer? How many sequencers are there now? where are they？
undefined says Yes I checked that -> I do have 6 vCPU, 16 gb RAM, 1.6 TB SSD (And 600 Mbit/s Port). I want to run a full node. But as far as I can see synchronizing is slower, than new blocks are created...
undefined says How can I disable creating log files and only log to console?
undefined says How do I set such a setting do we have a full list of arguments documented somewhere?
undefined says I am using a 6.8 TB Enterprise SSD with a ZFS pool and lz4 compression
1. would this be sufficient space to sync from nitro-genesis?
2. How many days on average does it take to sync from genesis?
undefined says I just started the sync, fingers crossed!
undefined says Thanks ! If I understand correctly, I just have to move my geth.ipc file to my /root/arbitrum/ directory, and update the execution endpoint flag of prysm /root/arbitrum/geth.ipc and update the flag l1.url like this ```--l1.url ipc:///root/arbitrum/geth.ipc```
undefined says Can you send the full command you're using to run your node? RAM seems ok, although SSD might be a bit tight if you're not pruning your node.
The other metrics to look at are network speed and disk I/O speed.
Whats the average rate of blocks being synced you're seeing?
undefined says You can try with param `--file-logging.enable=false`
undefined says

undefined says I want to run a full node to monitor the latest transactions with the minimum delay time, where should I put the node? America or Europe? Or put it in the place closest to the sequencer? How many sequencers are there now? where are they？
undefined says Can someone help me ?
undefined says https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-releases 
maybe use the API to query the releases and update the script variable for latest release when there is a new release ?
undefined says dockerhub has a query to get nitro-node tags too, but I don't see the version I'm running, might need to handle paging of the results
undefined says Yes, that was my message
undefined says Alright, 2 things about your command:
1. /some/local/dir/arbitrum must exist in your instance. Otherwise the data will not be saved for future runs of the node.
2. There's a more up-to-date and pruned snapshot here => https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar

The pruned snapshot will alleviate disk space, in case that's a problem. Otherwise, your command looks good. Maybe you can check some metrics about usage on Contabo and see if there's anything that stands out.
undefined says 1. The path exists
2. I am synchronizing already. Can I prune after to free some storage? I don't want to cancel the process.
In the screenshot above, I have to compare `"blockNum":86275750` with the actual blocks showed here: https://arbiscan.io/ -> If the numbers are equal, the node should be synced right?
undefined says So we are saying this is normal at first?
undefined says Do I need to increase memory?
undefined says How many sequencer do we have now?
undefined says Everytime I set up an arbitrum node in under an hour, this project becomes more valuable in defi because we can spin up spot priced bots, predictably.     Some projects are less auto'matic', and others are optimistic about their nonsense being acceptable.
undefined says look at your blocks arrival vs the blocks from other providers.  Look at your epeers when you get blocks first.
undefined says work to find the best peers, then find the cloud network they are running on.  Node that get the block first are likely to be closer in location or community with the sequencers friends.
undefined says It seems like things got hung up and then this happened, any ideas?
undefined says Nothing happened after that point it just sat like that for 2-3hrs
undefined says doing a graceful stop and kicking it back off
undefined says but the same thing happened before.
undefined says Thank you. I just want to know how many sequencer there are. And if possible,  where is the approximate locations
undefined says 
undefined says I would like to create a ticket with the developers for ask a question about how many arb in stake we need for run a full node. Thanks
undefined says Are you there
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says No arb need to stake, fullnode doesn’t need whitelist
undefined says is possible to change L1 rpc without stopping node?
undefined says No, you still need to stop and restart
undefined says For question 2, yes. Although you can also call the "eth_syncing" method to verify the syncing status. Here's a good FAQ about that => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#how-can-i-verify-that-my-node-is-fully-synced
undefined says Did you solve your problem?
If not, you can check this Troubleshooting guide and post back the report here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says I was running an archive node and was now planning to run full node.
is this snapshot correct https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar ? Also till what block is the past data retained in case of full node? 
Also can i convert my archive node to full node by just setting --init.prune and removing node.caching.archive? Please help!
Thanks.
undefined says I'm working on a research paper about Nova, I need to fetch a really big amount of data from the chain (all block and tx from genesis block). I think the best way for me to fetch this data, is to run an archive node. Do you know how much space I need to run an archive Nova node and how long it takes to fully sync ? Thank you for your answers
undefined says Hey!
Snapshot is correct. You would use that snapshot if you're starting up a new node.
Full node retains data for the latest 128 blocks.
Setting --init.prune and removing the archive param would make your node a full node, yes.
undefined says It should be around 300 GB for an archive Nova node, and my guess is that it shouldn't take more than 1 day to sync (but I'm not 100% sure about the timing as I haven't done so myself).
undefined says Thank you for your answer, I'm actually doing it, so I'll update you with that 🙂
undefined says Perfect. Thanks!
undefined says I tried pruning some nodes that were getting rather large, and  the iops was enough that some other blockchains sharing the node had trouble staying in sync.   It might be worth documenting some cgroups / docker options to limit it to 10k iops and leave some free to make pruning play nicer.
undefined says I'm assuming the additional IO is the pruning because thats what I changed, but its always possible my users have discovered exciting new techniques that make my setups too slow.
undefined says I tried to query the node with eth_syncing which is returning false, however it is 400 days behind present day block. Any idea what could be going on here?
undefined says Just see a ton of created block l2Block = block num
undefined says Is your L1 node synced?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs yes!
undefined says and when you say
> Just see a ton of created block l2Block = block num
are these block numbers out of date?
undefined says Yeah, roughly 400 days old
undefined says Wondering if I need to reboot the arb node ?
undefined says at what rate is it progressing?
undefined says mm I would say ~20blk/s
undefined says currently at 9,357,717
undefined says interesting.. I would double check that your L1 node is fully synced, but it sounds like the L2 is progressing towards being synced
undefined says Just did, L1 is fully synced. last block less than 20 seconds ago
undefined says if it's a geth fast sync note that it might have recent blocks but not recent execution data which the nitro node needs
undefined says Just unsure why eth_syncing is returning false on the arb node
undefined says Should I just let it be for the time being / should I plop in a snapshot? IIRC there wasn't one for Arb-Nova
undefined says Could arb using my eth node for l1 affect the latency of said node by chance ?
undefined says Trying to track down why it’s giving me an average response time of 130ms when it was 70-80 not long ago
undefined says What docker image you use? Nitro or classic?
undefined says nitro
undefined says Also just want to clarify, I am talking latency on the ethereum node. Arbs average response time is really fast. But seems something is up with the box running erigon for my l1. As even a general ping to it when arbitrum is off is 91ms when another same-spec server in the same dc we use returns ~30ms
undefined says Eh, ran a test and doesn't seem to change it whether arb is running or not. Likely something to do with the box / network
undefined says Is this normal?
undefined says I been running for 2 days now and still not sync'd
undefined says I followed these instructions: https://mirror.xyz/0xf3bF9DDbA413825E5DdF92D15b09C2AbD8d190dd/i4OnpBFIJUKA6z_pqN2gu2zst2MUaHOqrxSX4vCW9cM
undefined says I downloaded the snapdata locally and running from there
undefined says Hey Thanks! Just one more question. For syncing and running full node, do i need L1-url of archive node? Or full node l1-url would work? 
Thanks
undefined says 1. Is this 400 days old is your l2 block or l1 block? Nitro genesis on 2022/8/31, which means nitro’s first block is only about 270 days ago.
2. If it is l2 block, how do you set init.url? Or you set it as init.empty?
undefined says Please check your l1 node, some wrong with that.
undefined says Full l1 node works.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs restarted the l1 node all is well! Not sure what was goin on
undefined says Is there any way on making the node not dependable on the feed? It kind of defeats the point of running your own node if I'm still dependent on a single point of failure...

`WARN [05-23|15:57:37.837] readData returned EOF                    url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed opcode=0 err=EOF
ERROR[05-23|15:57:37.840] no connected feed`
undefined says Anyone else's node acting up? Syncs blocks 4 times and then stops for like 3 minutes and emits another 4 "created block" logs
undefined says WARN [05-23|16:26:05.329] error reading inbox                      err="failed to fetch batch mentioned by batch posting report: accumulator not found"
undefined says the same
undefined says running the latest version as well
undefined says It mean 5mb/s bandwidth?
undefined says same problem here @Crumbs
undefined says seems Arbiscan is experiencing problems too
undefined says last block was 1 min ago
undefined says seems like it's better now
undefined says was probably an issue from relay
undefined says l1 only works with the docker container IP address
undefined says Not localhost:8545 or 0.0.0.0:8545.
undefined says Also experiencing this. If someone from support can help out... here is my troubleshooting report:

undefined says Hey,
We currently have issue on sequencer feed. Working on it. Will send updates here
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1108083233624707173

I figured out the issue here. I went into the pod that was running arbitrum itself and ran the kill command there and it shutdown instantly. So my hunch that it wasn't receiving the sigterm signal from kubernetes was correct. Opening an issue with graphops soon
undefined says thanks
undefined says `accumulator not found ` likely caused by L1 node not being up to date or not being a full node
undefined says Sequencer feed should be ok right now. If you're sending too much requests, you may get rate limited. If you are running a lot of nodes, you should use feed relay
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says hey, I started a private network from test-node.sh and started a local node. I deployed erc20 contract to the network. On my local node, when I send a transaction that sends erc20 token from account that does not have funds (on purpose) to another account (transfer() method on the deployed contract) the transaction gets instantly rejected by node :
{"code":3,"message":"execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"....
The transaction does not get into the block and the error is presented instantly by the node.
But when I do the same on a arbitrum goerli testnet node: the node returns a transaction hash as a response, the transaction gets into the block but gets rejected afterwards (it is also visible on arbiscan). 
Are there any config options or flags on arbitrum goerli testnet node that are responsible for this behavior? Can I achieve the same behavior on my local network and how to do this?
undefined says Hi!
I want to run using `git clone https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro`, but I don't know how to run local.
I referenced https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally and follow docs, but it occur error on `make` command.
How to fix this error in photo? or Is there another way to run?
undefined says how can I build layer 3
undefined says do you have llvm/clang installed/in your PATH ?
undefined says Every single time I turn off the node it corrupts
undefined says FFS
undefined says "err="missing trie node"
undefined says This has not always been the case. Just after some update
undefined says Or is it something else?
undefined says Used to work fine though. For a long time
undefined says umm no. I will tell you after install my PATH
undefined says @cameron57 thx! I got successfully building result. Then, run `make push`?
undefined says 
undefined says I'm connected with the IP address of the container
undefined says localhost:8545 doesn't connect, only way it does is with container IP Address
undefined says Is this right in how it looks?
undefined says Its been running for several days. I downloaded snapdata and how long from there does it take to sync?
undefined says Your l1 node doesn’t sync, you need let your l1 node sync first and when it finish syncing then start your l2 node to sync.
undefined says You can follow this to compile nitro: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says so its doing as it supposed to
undefined says I mean, your l1 node is not syncing, you need to check it why it doesn’t sync the state, if your l1 node doesn’t finish syncing, it will affect your l2 node syncing.
undefined says I use ubuntu would it work if not debian following those instructions?
undefined says I already got successfully building result.
But i don't know how to run node.
Just run `docker build .`?
undefined says So you already have nitro executable file right? If so, just run it and add the tags we provide: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/gentle-introduction-run-node. Or what you build is docker image?
undefined says It should work.
undefined says I switched to a more recent image and now getting this
undefined says 
undefined says According to this errors, can you send eth_blockNumber rpc call to your l1 node?
undefined says What is your l2 node start command?
undefined says docker compose up -d on both of them. Is that what you talking about
undefined says I’m not sure
undefined says Oh, if you want to run mainnet node, you should follow this: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Umm.. now I got nitro image through docker build.
Next, I will modify the docker-compose file to be assigned to the volume I want.
And run the command below..
```bash
docker-compose up -d \
--name nitro \
-v /mypath/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum \
-p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 \
-p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 nitro \
--l1.url <ethereum-mainnet-rpc-endpoint> \
--l2.chain-id=42161 \
--http.api=net,web3,eth,debug \
--http.corsdomain=* \
--http.addr=0.0.0.0 \
--http.vhosts=*
```
I don't know if that's the way I think it is........

Because my purpose is to allocate docker volume where I want and run the node, I'm building myself without pulling `OffchainLabs/nitro-node` image.
undefined says and I will run node with mainnet snapshot
undefined says But you can still mount your volume using our docker image by -v?
If you already build that image successfully, you should see it by `docker images` can you see it using this command?
undefined says yes!
undefined says Anyone? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  do you maybe know something? :<
undefined says Nice, if so, you can directly run that image
undefined says why are transactions submitted to the sequencer via arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/rpc whereas the sequencer's feed is accessed from arb1.arbitrum.io? it makes it seem like those two are different hosts? why does arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io not expose its feed?
undefined says I got three error..
1. `error: database "blockscout" does not exist`
2. `error: relation "addresses" does not exist`
3. `service "create_beacon_chain_genesis" didn't complete successfully: exit 1`
why happen this error? and how to solve?

I modified `docker-compose.yaml` file for my mac environment.
```yaml
...
services:
  blockscout:
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - sequencer
    image: offchainlabs/blockscout:v1.0.0-c8db5b1
...
  relay:
    pid: host
    image: offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9652:9652"
    entrypoint: relay
    command: --node.feed.output.port 9652 --node.feed.input.url ws://sequencer:9652
...
```
and run `docker-compose up`
undefined says what system do you use?
undefined says cc @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says im using mac m1
undefined says arm doesn’t have full functionality  like don’t have blocksouct image.
undefined says ok. And now I'm trying the same way on Ubuntu, but this time I got this error.
```
ERROR: for prysm_beacon_chain  Container "19c27ffead7b" exited with code 1.
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```
undefined says What do you build this for? I see you already build the nitro container, this prysm container is used for l1 side
undefined says try this flag
--node.tx-pre-checker.strictness 10
undefined says 0 = accept anything, 10 = should never reject anything that'd succeed, 20 = likely won't reject anything that'd succeed, 30 = full validation which may reject txs that would succeed
undefined says i tried it with 0 value. did not solve the problem
undefined says This is a scammer
undefined says is this normal?

undefined says it's already 1 month old
undefined says can you publish new ?

undefined says Almost 100% of the time when I'm going the wrong direction time wise I have been having io issues with my disks or was running something that was saturating the network.    what OS are you using ?  Is your disk close to full capacity ?   Are there any cgroups etc throttling your disk io ?
undefined says cpu intel core 13900k ram ddr5 6000 mt 64 gb 
internet 500mb/s

undefined says I can't find the problem
undefined says I think perfmon might be the windows program that can look at the iops for read/write to the disk and see if your having a disk io queue/backlog
undefined says the docs are not clear for runing a node
undefined says got this error anyone know what it mean?
undefined says your os might not be llvm linker version 13,   you are installing the default clang,  try using lld without -13 ?

undefined says it goes up to 0xf0 and then writes it out.  Your almost there.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Is this chat GPT response correct?
undefined says the respaond is more detailed than the official doc of arbitrum
undefined says I wonder what makes most of the blockchain gurus dont spend time is writing a clear documaintation
undefined says it's good that I didn't stop docker
undefined says interesting,  fixing keys is one of the quirks in my snapshot system.    Did you try it ?
undefined says no I'm just wondering if that is correct because it is even more clearer than official arbitrum docs
undefined says I am not quite sure you can use both the conf file and flag
undefined says Hola
undefined says `--node.sequencer.max-revert-gas-reject=0`
undefined says my boss got a paid gpt chat account,  I'm curious if its still from 2021 or more current.  Blockchain changes so fast.
undefined says @cameron57  did you sucesfully run your arbitrum node?
undefined says my nodes are running ok, I haven't tried some of the enviroment variables that might make it easier to configure
undefined says is there a way to prune data from arbitrum one nodes?
undefined says You need upgrade your node to v2.0.14, and then use --init.prune
undefined says it looks like I can
undefined says it worked! thank you very much! also @gzeon | Offchain Labs thanks for your effort
undefined says Can you please send me the commands you used step by step till finish? That will simplify my research
undefined says Did you try running your node with these instructions? => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
If you're finding issues in any of the steps, please let us know so we can both help you and improve the documentation available 🙂
undefined says 👀  any more info available for pruning? Like how long does it approx. take and how much free disk space is required etc.?
undefined says thank you
undefined says Im using contabo dedicated server
undefined says It will depend on the amount of info to be pruned. The longer you've been storing information, the longer it will take to have all that pruned.
undefined says How long does it take for a nitro node to sync from scratch? Just getting this in the logs so I suppose I just have to wait?
undefined says I am looking for a public websocket server link to fetch data from blockchain in real time.
undefined says Yeap, it might take a while to sync. I see you're close though. Block 83641000 / 94677476
undefined says yeah it's doing about 110 blocks/s, so one more day it seems... should I set init.prune?
undefined says You can set it now if you want. Stop it gracefully and reinitialise your node with that flag.
Or you can set it later too.
undefined says 
undefined says 😦 bad bot
undefined says this is what I've got when setting it to `full`: `pruning: failed to find root to retain for pruning: refusing to prune to full-node level when validator is enabled (you should prune in validator mode)"`
undefined says is it because it's still syncing?
undefined says https://gist.github.com/0xalex88/fb7c3414177d2766541ef8cce19ef6b1 this is how I run it
undefined says Try with `--init.prune=validator` (the default mode in the latest versions is "Watchtower" which is considered a validator in nitro's configuration)
undefined says any downside of using validator instead of full?
undefined says 
undefined says Most the dirrectory be /some/local/dir/?
undefined says can i rename it to something else?
undefined says Not much. Validator also validates blocks and, in this case, Watchtower raises a message if it finds an incorrect assertion => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-validator
undefined says You can use any local dir you want, just make sure docker can write to it.
undefined says Okay Thank you @José FP | Offchain Labs  more power to you for responding
undefined says got it thanks!
undefined says 
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs   I have the local dirr in both var/ and usr/
undefined says I'm good to run it without any mkr dir command?
undefined says Oh, it doesn't need to be called "local". I meant that you can use any dir you want in your system. You could create, for example /var/arbitrum-data or /home/<your-user>/node-data , or any you want.
undefined says Okay thank you @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says Okay
undefined says Got it
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs  one more question on this  --l1.url https://l1-node:8545    can I use a third party ethereum RPC like alcamy?
undefined says Sure !
undefined says Thank you
undefined says It says I'm connected, I followed the directions
undefined says I read through previous post. I updated to 2.14 and put -- init.prune .. Getting these errors
undefined says I'm running from my external harddrive which is my e: drive.
undefined says 
undefined says running --init.prune it say don't recognize the flag but I take that out an run like this and blockchain stops
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st
undefined says 
undefined says Hey ! I'm coming back with few insights about the sync of a Nova node. 
I hah this vps : 
6 cores,
16 Go RAM,
1.2 To SSD,
600Mb/s down

It took around 10 hours to sync, and the database was less than 30 Go. no pruning.
I have few questions regarding L1 Data Fee and the frequency of the settlement tx on the L1 :
  - There is a L1PricerFundsPool account on Arbitrum One but I can't find it on Nova. Does the pricing of the L1 Data Fee on Nova has the same mechanism of Arbitrum One ?

- When calculating L1 Data Fee for an L2 transaction do you apply the fee on the full input of the L2 transaction, or do you apply the fee on the compressed (Brotli-zero) data input ? 

- Settlement Tx Frequency on the sequencer inbox seems to follow two rules :
    a. minimum frequency  is 30 minutes.
    b. Frequency scales exponentially with the data size of the L2 blocks
Can you confirm that ?

Thank you for your answer
undefined says Why is the docker not able to find my nitro.tar file?
undefined says 
undefined says I have the nitro.tar file in the exact dirr I specified
undefined says 
undefined says I got the reason for the error
undefined says On my config file i did not put the path in a  quote ( ' ')
undefined says You need put this file to your docker mount point and use your docker file path.
undefined says 
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs do you have any idea on the above query?
undefined says @Johnnex|server.Eth what do you mean?
undefined says Yes. How can we handle lot of parallel debug calls without failing with timeouts?
undefined says It has been running from last three months! We deployed it using Docker image - `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec`
undefined says Which version is recommended?
undefined says Nope
undefined says @Ana 💙 Arbitrum can we run arbitrum archive node (nitro) in read-only mode (disabling sync)?
undefined says why the same async function takes different time to be submitted to the node? node and script in the same server
undefined says Please anyone knows the reason for this and how to correct it?
undefined says this the  'file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar'
undefined says As stated in the docs
undefined says Let’s talk on my wall
undefined says Okay
undefined says I cant find your wall
undefined says You can’t send me a text?
undefined says Okay
undefined says Done
undefined says 
undefined says Do we have to connect to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed when we want to run a feed relay? No way to go through our own node?
undefined says I have a warn that says "Head State Missing, Repairing"   Is there anything on my end that I need to do?
undefined says You don’t need to set it manually, it is on default settings.
undefined says No need, just need wait some time and it will recover.
undefined says Try remove the colon
undefined says hey, I want to run an arbitrum full archive node both classic and nitro. will I still need 2T of space or did this increase already
 official docs say that it increases with 128 gb per week, which is 6.6T per year lol
undefined says also, do I need ethereum archive node in order to run arbitrum achive node? I would like to have all arbitrum data on my local node
undefined says or can I just use an ethereum node that was synced with snap mode and to run arbitrum full archive which will have all data
undefined says Nice project
undefined says And can we change it ? Like set it to our own node? Because I'm detecting txs through feed relay almost at the same time they are mined
undefined says done but still not  working
undefined says Please anyone to help with this? I did everything as dirrected on the docs but still docker not able to open the nitro.tar file
undefined says I updated the new version of nitro --l1.url="myl1url" does not work. I changed it to --node.data-availability.parent-chain-node-url="myl1url" and still reported an error couldn't connect to L1 err="no url provided for this connection "
undefined says Yes, of course: --node.feed.input.url=<feed address>
undefined says You need to remove the : too.
undefined says You need move the file to mount point first, and then  use docker container’s path not your host’s.
undefined says Is it possible to run the node without Docker? I am having trouble where Docker keeps deleting the chain data
undefined says yes you can build project by yourself
undefined says and use ./nitro to run
undefined says So just follow the steps in the docker file? I see there are like 1000 hehe
undefined says Or is there a cleaner self-build guide?
undefined says ./nitro --l1.url="" --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --persistent.global-config /data/arbdata --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --ipc.path nitro.ipc --init.url=file:///root/nitro.tar
undefined says just like this
undefined says yes thank you, but first I need to build nitro from code yes?
undefined says For me it does not compile:
undefined says I built it myself, maybe you can find some other methods
undefined says It is very troublesome to configure the environment. I have studied for a long time before I can get it done.
undefined says This startup command is not applicable to the latest nitro, and I am also studying how to start a new nitro
undefined says You can actually find the compiled binary though:
undefined says Well I had some modifications to nitro so I built it myself
undefined says Okay lemme try this
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Were there any issues with your side today I had one of my nodes spewing:
``` INFO [05-31|09:46:26.515] connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
```
In addition
```ERROR[05-31|12:10:12.446] error calling readData                   url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed opcode=0 err="read tcp 10.128.0.9:40830->172.67.4.52:443: read: connection reset by peer"
ERROR[05-31|12:10:12.446] no connected feed
```
This was happening most of today
undefined says .
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Please which path should i use here
undefined says 👋  I'm trying to run a full environment locally, is this possible to run a local nova evm on top of the chain from the official doc tutorial "how to run a local dev node" (https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node) ? I didn't find any doc about it :/ (or maybe i missed something ? )
undefined says I don't know if this helps to see where docker goes wrong, but I can send you a script that I use to start a new node and maybe theres a typo somewhere in your setup.   It doesn't look like its going to paste well.  So I won't do that.
undefined says I just had to read the docker docs closer. In the note guide it does not say you have to create a docker volume and mount the node on it. Because thats what you have to do
undefined says docker volume create arbitrum, then use docker run --rm -it  -v arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 ... etc
undefined says APAC connections have some issues yesterday, but now it should fix
undefined says When you start your node, you can see the command line has -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum, you need move your nitro.tar to the /some/local/dir/arbitrum, then use --init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar"
undefined says Our docs only have info about nitro local test node.
undefined says Why l1.url doesn’t work, any error thrown?
undefined says Our node suddenly returns this error 
```
err="required historical state unavailable (reexec=128)"

plz help to advice
undefined says 
undefined says 4-5 block per second, how can I speed up.
undefined says Hey, I am wondering if is there any guide on how to deploy an L3 for arbitrum nitro. Is a good start point deploying the nitro contracts? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts
undefined says Hi! how to check my node running is correctly!?
undefined says my docker logs show me
i get everytime resuming/abotring state snapshot
undefined says Okay, i was doing it that way but still did not work, lemme try again
undefined says Did you send a debug_traceBlockByNumber? If so, can you share what block did you request and what's the docker run command you're using for your L2 node?
undefined says Syncing speed can vary depending on multiple factors. You can find the minimum hardware requirements to run your node in this page => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration
You should also verify your network and disk speed.
undefined says Hey, we haven't published any guide yet, but we're working on one to be published soon. It will be published in this section => https://developer.arbitrum.io/chain-launching/quickstart-launch-l3-chain
undefined says It looks like it's syncing. You can check the progress with the instructions described here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#how-can-i-verify-that-my-node-is-fully-synced
undefined says Seems i have got it now
undefined says Is this how it runs?
undefined says Should be fine, but can you share once again your final docker run command? 
You were running it on Windows iirc, right?
undefined says I'm runing it on Linux
undefined says I have recorded the full process, i can share the video link here if it is accepted
undefined says I think it will help others too
undefined says Sure! 
(Not sure if the bot allows posting links, but you can try)
undefined says Okay great
undefined says i will post soon
undefined says Can't i find any doc about this ?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node
undefined says Thank you! I did see that and filled out the form. Is a good starting point deploying the smart contracts from https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts ? I am trying to write down my own guide and automate the process as much as possible (using Terraform and https://github.com/ferranbt/terraform-provider-ethereum) so If you can give some pointers on the technical side I can advance some of the work.
undefined says I'm ok with the local nitro node, I'm looking for some Doc about running a local nova node (sorry i was not clear)
undefined says I can't provide any more information right now, but you can study how One and Nova work to get the idea of how the L3s will work. Keep in mind that there are many different actors in the infrastructure (contracts on L2, contracts on L3, precompiles, nodes, sequencer, ...) so it is a complex work.
Having said that, you can always ask specific questions if you get blocked while doing tests.
undefined says Can I ask why you would need specifically an Anytrust node? (so I can understand your use case) Anytrust are basically Nitro nodes with DAC functionality. And they even behave like Nitro if the DAC doesn't behave as expected.
undefined says 
undefined says My node is runing fine, but this is the rpc response
undefined says please what does it mean?
undefined says the command is:
```
nitro
      --l1.url=<L1_INTERNAL_ENDPOINT>
      --l2.chain-id=42161
      --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug
      --http.corsdomain=*
      --http.addr=0.0.0.0
      --http.vhosts=*
      --init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
```
undefined says How to start syncing nitro from beginning? I've enabled archive but it started syncing from 80M
undefined says I did pass it a snapshot tho
undefined says Here is our snapshot list: https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html
undefined says How can i do it?
undefined says Scam
undefined says Indian scamer
undefined says Which one should I take, archive?
undefined says Which type of node do you want to run?
undefined says I want to run a ordinary node, but sync it from beginning
undefined says I want it to sync from beginning and do the garbage collector do its job
undefined says I guess I'd need to take nitro-genesis snapshot?
undefined says You have to send a JSON-RPC requests, using curl for example. 
A good tool for manually querying your node is Postman. Infura has a good doc here that explains the process and they even have a Postman collection available to play with => https://docs.infura.io/infura/networks/ethereum/how-to/make-requests
(You would have to change the URL you call, but it might help you understand how to send requests to your node)
undefined says I'd say you're trying to debug_trace a block that your node does not have the info for. If you want to trace old blocks, you'd need to query an archive node.
undefined says If you want a full node, you can use nitro-pruned.tar . This snapshot contains all blocks prior to ~80M (don't remember the exact block), so you'd only need to sync from there. If you want to sync from the beginning, you can use nitro-genesis.tar.
If you want an archive node, you can use nitro-archive.tar (will continue syncing from ~80M block, but having all archival info from previous blocks), or nitro-genesis.tar to sync from the beginning. In this case remember to use the appropriate flag.
undefined says Are there any logging args for me to see how long it takes for my node to process a transaction that I am sending?
undefined says I see the submitted transaction line, but was hoping to see some more debug related lines
undefined says You can try with --log-level=5 (default is 3) . It will output DEBUG and TRACE logs.
undefined says 
undefined says Please what is the meaning of this INFO?
undefined says ok thank you @José FP | Offchain Labs , but what if i want to use it on my app using web3.py  can i use the url http://127.0.0.1:8549 ?
undefined says 
undefined says I got this error on web3.py while connecting to the node on http://127.0.0.1:8549/
undefined says 
undefined says Okay my node is working normally
undefined says i just needed to increase the timeout
undefined says how do validators make money? the difference between the fees they get on L2 and the costs on L1?
undefined says Is their any doc on how to run validator node? Like once the node is running how to stake and everything. 

Couldn't find any detailed doc.
undefined says Yes, I'm actually developping contracts for a game, then I would like to have a local test environment that is as close as possible to the production environment. But if I understand correctly, I can simply create my test environment with Nitro without having to worry about any undesirable side effects when deploying to Nova, right?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Were `debug_traceTransaction` `callTracer` result parameters recently changed in Arbitrum Nitro 2.1.0? Prior to upgrading, traces used to include the `type` field towards the end of the JSON RPC call, returning either `CALL` or `CREATE`. After upgrading my client, with archive node enabled, that particular field disappeared. Will this call still return if the transaction was either a `CALL` & `CREATE`?

Old style:

undefined says I hope the annoying bot message doesn't appear above for everyone... my message was deleted because I included a greeting before my question 😅
undefined says I think this was an upstream geth change, let me check
undefined says Ahh yeah, I thought I was on the latest Go-Ethereum & just saw they have a v1.12.0 release, with a "breaking change" warning. I will check with them then if so
undefined says This might be on our end, it isn't documented in the release notes. If you have an up to date geth node it'd be helpful to check the behavior there too
undefined says Thanks, yeah I'm still on the prior Geth release. I will try on their latest release in a few hours
undefined says hmm I do think it was uninintentional looking at this -- I think callFrameMarshaling isn't being used as it should but I don't really understand gencodec https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/eth/tracers/native/gen_callframe_json.go#L19
undefined says thanks, yeah it would be great if you could test it out. My current theory is that it was an unintentional geth breakage but I could be wrong
undefined says I've commented on pull #1638 as well, which was mentioned on Arbitrum Nitro release v.2.1.0 Alpha 2, so hopefully someone from the team will get a chance to check it out:

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1638#issuecomment-1575160895
undefined says Thanks -- it would be helpful if you could check if this occurs on newer upstream geth versions as well
undefined says Will do once I get the chance, and will update you all
undefined says does arb1.arbitrum.io also have a websocket rPC?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  I have noticed my APAC node has had many disonnects recently. 
```ERROR[06-05|11:19:24.872] Server connection timed out without receiving data url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="read tcp XXXX:60948->104.22.64.211:443: i/o timeout"

INFO [06-05|11:19:26.373] connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
```
This has happened 20 times today alone. Load on my node seems very normal. Are yall having issues on the apac side of things?
undefined says 
undefined says Update for you: I'm running the latest Go-Ethereum v1.12.0 and made a `debug_traceTransaction` call to an ETH mainnet hash from less than 10 minutes ago. Confirmed there's no change on the GETH side and the `type` parameter change is unique to Arbitrum Nitro v2.1.0

`curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"debug_traceTransaction","params":["0xb3c729655f4800e015fced9ff312a8a34ec7e935ab3743a2c4367a792f958f65", {"tracer": "callTracer"}],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" <local node URL>`

undefined says I've also added a comment to pull #1638
undefined says run docker enough and your eyes glaze over and these steps get missed in the docs.  great catch !
undefined says I'm unable to paste links in this channel, but I see the exact line where the `type` parameter was not copied over. Check lines 30 & 31:

`Value *hexutil.Big`
`TypeString string`

For the changes, only `Value` was copied over while `TypeString` was forgotten
undefined says 
undefined says This is in:

`eth/tracers/native/gen_callframe_json.go`
undefined says thanks!
undefined says Did you confirm that your PR fixes the issue and the type field appears in the output again?
undefined says My mistake, it breaks. Will redo & re-verify
undefined says Does anyone have any instructions for running a node without docker? I'd prefer to build the binary and run the service if possible.
undefined says 
undefined says whats the true storage requirement for running an arbitrum node on mac right now?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Confirmed working, by building OffchainLabs/nitro/go-ethereum pointed to my forked branch:

`curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"debug_traceTransaction","params":["0xcb91013e1bf7d0131ac1cfee691dfd6bc833e6285126976a74e352767f72e954", {"tracer": "callTracer"}],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" <node-url>`
undefined says 
undefined says Could you confirm if this branch works too? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/pull/225
undefined says `regenerate-gen-callframe`
undefined says I think this is pretty normal for public websockets and people just handle reconnecting when it drops in our apps ?
undefined says 
undefined says Rebuilt the `OffchainLabs/nitro` master branch using `OffchainLabs/go-ethereum` commit fd0d03683add5df2a3507796c7c69c423ae29d31, and confirmed the `debug_traceTransaction` JSONRPC response has the correct formatting, including the `type` parameter
undefined says 
undefined says thanks! The fix is now in nitro master and will be in the next release 🙂
undefined says I mean this is in the core arbitrum node code. Not sure how this even applies.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says bot not allow to post the video link
undefined says hey, how big is the arbitrum archive node running on erigon? how much storage do I need to have
undefined says Are the tracecall (debug_traceBlockByNumber, debug_traceBlock) available by default for archive node? 
Do we need to enable it by anychance?
undefined says Which is the default value for `--node.tx-pre-checker.strictness uint`

undefined says is there any issue on your side? getting:
```

```
and blocks not processing new blocks ...
undefined says same
undefined says hey my nodes suddenly unable to process new blocks as well has something happened:
undefined says sequncer is most likely down
undefined says it isn't
txs are getting processed
undefined says where did you get this info? do they have a status page?
undefined says hey so wen arbitrum is not an endpoint returning 429 (too many requests)
undefined says `failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed       err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429"`
undefined says Same here
undefined says Me too, issues with the sequencer perhaps?
undefined says arbiscan has stopped showing new blocks and cannot connect to sequencer, riperino
undefined says NVM arbiscan is just behind it seems
undefined says ` failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429"`
undefined says Seems sequencer has crapped itself
undefined says my nodes stuck on a block 39 minutes ago
undefined says Arbiscan is showing blocks and one of my nodes is still running.
undefined says what region is your node in? All of my nodes in apac,us and eu are all unale to conenct?
undefined says how did you find this?
undefined says node logs
undefined says my nodes are in us
undefined says is there a fallback url,instead of wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed we can use?
undefined says our nodes are starting to recover... `arb1.arbitrum.io/feed `  is back online
undefined says Is your node based in APAC?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I had nodes in EU, Apac, and the us not be able to connect
undefined says I have one APAC node that works and a APAC node that doesn't and a US one that does not
undefined says US
undefined says Same here!
undefined says unfortunately I'm not getting that
undefined says yea it did and it started to die again
undefined says I see blocks for a little bit but then feed error again
undefined says L1 batches paused for an hour and have only just begun again, not sure if thats normal.
undefined says Yeah, that's more accurate for me too. Block height diagram looks like a staircase
undefined says Yeah, we noticed that, and we are looking into it.
undefined says Ok, how many nodes are you running in your IP address?
undefined says 1
undefined says still seeing some issues:
```INFO [06-07|11:33:30.993] connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed```
undefined says me too
undefined says Started syncing but then stopped again 5 minutes ago
undefined says l2Block=98,697,641
undefined says That occurs when its not connected to feed, restart the node
undefined says Mine are working again.
undefined says just restarted but same issue (server in US, only 1 node)
undefined says 
undefined says INFO [06-07|21:33:29.098] connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=arb1/feed
undefined says rip arbitrum
undefined says Same, restart syncs for a little bit and then error connecting to broadcast
undefined says Where are you hosting, if its popular the sequencer could have given the ipv6 group a timeout for an hour
undefined says 3 nodes are down across gcp/aws/ovh
undefined says you mean where in the US or which provider?
undefined says so its the endpoint
undefined says cloud provider
undefined says namecheap
undefined says syncing some more, but still over 1 mil blocks behind
undefined says issue persists:
```WARN [06-07|11:37:54.212] failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arb │

undefined says yeah arbitrum died about 40 minutes ago
undefined says you can resort to spamming rpc calls instead of ws i guess
undefined says never heard of it, probs not the issue then
undefined says 
undefined says is there a status page on ARB side?
undefined says one of my nodes has recovered the other one is still borked ive restarted it but still hasnt recovered
undefined says did it just recovered or needed a restart?
undefined says one recovered by itself but it's not stable at all the other one has still the issue
undefined says I restarted one of my nodes for it to actually start recovering (I think that helped) one of the other nodes I have I also restared still hasnt recovered
undefined says still stuck
undefined says ```connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed``` getting this error a lot
undefined says guys setup a redundant URL serving the feed! asap
undefined says agreed, decentralize the sequencer to the validators
we are more than happy to help if you need extra validators 🙂
undefined says wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed is a single point of failure for the whole arb1 network. unbearable
undefined says its giving a 429 rate limit error. lovely
undefined says failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429
undefined says how is it possible that others rpcs are still working
undefined says You can still use the public rpc
undefined says yes I know
undefined says but other nodes aren't connecting to the feed so that's why
undefined says yep at the moment it just give `connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`
undefined says Fully agree with this!
undefined says do we have a status page for arbitrum.io?
undefined says Is anyone running Full Node? What are the current system requirements to run a full node reliably? I think there may be some gaps in the specifications provided in the documentation, and I'm asking for help to double check.
undefined says currently using 8core i5, 16gb ram, and 2TB nvme
undefined says that handles 10m requests per day without breaking a sweat
undefined says when the sequencer works, that is.....
undefined says can't they just turn on and off?😂
undefined says are you still seeing issue or your nodes recover?
undefined says now working
undefined says mine caught up
undefined says now that was fun. not.
undefined says Still intermittent from what we can see
undefined says Hey!! Does Arbitrum still support tracing API? How can I enable it? I am reading the doc but can't find relating information
undefined says We support geth trace method, but you need enable archive mode for some traces.
undefined says Appreciate your response! May I assume if archive mode is enabled, all traces will be available?
Since AFAIK, for eth, some traces are only available on Erigon
undefined says Only support geth’s debug rpc method
undefined says any Post Mortem for yesterday issue?
undefined says Yes, we will have one later
undefined says 
undefined says once synced the requirements are low.   I have an AWS blockchain system with incremental updates that can start nodes fast and then move to a cheaper setup.  2CPU, 4GB RAM on the low side, but I'm syncing with 8CPU, 16GB+ RAM, and 20000 iops.
undefined says 
undefined says How is it possible that HTTP is faster than IPC?
undefined says Why is my full node always 22M blocks behind
undefined says make a curl using `eth_syncing `method and share the response
undefined says Is there a way to log when someone connect to our node?
undefined says add an http proxy in front of the node and log the requests ?
undefined says I saw a cli argument that was refering to log clients connection but doesn't work
undefined says something similar to --node.feed....
undefined says 
undefined says I can't even show a screen shot of my saving because it upsets this community
undefined says my amazon bill is 70% less with my blockchain system
undefined says Does arbitrum work with AWS for kickbacks ?
undefined says 70% savings is sensetive to developers ?
undefined says or post a link
undefined says sweet forum guys .
undefined says What is the motivation to stop people from helping to cut the amazon bill 70% when crypto just crashed 20%+ ?
undefined says This is how MeV happens.
undefined says Creating great, expensive, private systems instead of fostering a community that can share.
undefined says You probably don’t set init.url which let you lack the genesis block (sum 22m)
undefined says Did you use log.level?
undefined says We are currently preparing to onboard a full node, so I would like to know what the average network usage is, I realize that in some situations it is difficult to measure quantitatively. Do you have a monitoring environment like public grafana?
undefined says does anyone know roughly how long it takes to prune a fresh node?
undefined says you mean this? `--log.rpc string`
undefined says Where can I find Arbitrum node's config file in ubuntu system?
undefined says I am trying to run my arbitrum full node and try to use ws rpc provider. 
Http provider is working well, but ws provider is not working.
Where can I find config.toml in ubuntu system?
undefined says No, that for is classic node, you can set log-level 4, then you can see Served rpc info.
undefined says Did you set --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* and mount 8548 port?
undefined says Yes, I set like that.
undefined says Can you share with me your start command?
undefined says yeah,
undefined says does web socket for subscribing new blocks only works only when the node is "in sync"?  Please help!
undefined says docker run -d -v ~/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url <rpc url> --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https:// snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says Does any error throw when connect to your ws endpoint?
undefined says While try to connect, `connection not open on send()`.
This err happen
undefined says Thanks
undefined says I am also having trouble connecting to the nitro websocket on my local node with code that worked fine a month or so ago. I get this error now in python: ssl.SSLError: [SSL: WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER] wrong version number (_ssl.c:1002)
undefined says are you sure you are using ws and not wss?
undefined says I am trying to set up a node , but am little lost.
undefined says We have a detailed docs about running node here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/quickstart-running-a-node
undefined says Also you can find some frequent questions and answers here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq
undefined says That’s weird, I just use your command, it works, do you try to connect ws in the same local network or from public network?
undefined says thanks that worked, i blame the worms in my brain.'
undefined says I tried again and it worked. thx
undefined says If I run archive mode with snapshot, doss the node archives only after snapshot data or archives full data?
I need everything from the genesis block to the latest block, but I wonder if ancient blocks can't be archived if I use a snapshot.
undefined says It depends on your snapshot, if your snapshot is not archive snapshot, then the node only serve archive data request after that snapshot, to run a full archive node, you should see this docs: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-an-archive-node
undefined says I got it! Thank you 🙂
undefined says I am trying to research about the Arbitrum Validators and the only mention of them that I can find is here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#2-validator-ownership
Problem is that the link for the list of the active validators who can be found in the second point is broken. It redirects to a page with the important smart contract addresses but has no mention of the validators. I have opened a GitHub issue about that but in the meantime I was wondering if you are able to provide me with a working link for the list of the whitelisted validators.
undefined says 
undefined says I'm trying to setup a full node these few days and really i need some genius here to help.

The ETH node is set up in the same server as well and no problem in connecting to its docker.

Snapshot rar has been successfully extracted (I download it from official snapshot link to  get the nitro-pruned.rar and rename it and put back to the corresponding direct and change `--init.url=file:///arbitrum-node/snap/nitro.tar`

The rar has been successfully extracted after several hours.
however the program tries initialising and after several minutes the program end with log displayed as `Blockchain stopped`

the only error log is `no contract code at given address`

Definitely i need somebody to help in order to proceed as I tried for days to solve it 🙇🏻‍♂️
undefined says The corresponding log:
undefined says whats the difference in state history between prunung iwth `validator` and `full`?
undefined says Oh, it moved to this page: https://developer.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/public-chains#allowlisted-validators
undefined says Could you have a check which snapshot you use and if that snapshot is for that chain Id you are running?
undefined says It depends on if your node have run validator node or not.
undefined says Thanks Jason

I downloaded thro `snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar` and the downloaded file is nitro-pruned.tar

Is it the correct way or I should download it from a specific page from official site instead
undefined says Hey, can you send the full docker run command you're running?
undefined says I have downloaded and extracted the tar file but keep getting this error on my docker-compose up command : err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"  I see it is an unresolved error on github and was wondering if anyone found a workaround
undefined says Can you go through this Troubleshooting page and copy the report here?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says I see your --init.url line is commented. Also, try with this file directly => https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar
It should work either way because nitro.tar is redirecting to nitro-pruned.tar, but let's try just in case.
undefined says Now the node seems to be stuck after downloading initial database
undefined says I am new here
I would like to ask which rewards a noderunning will get?
Thanks
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks @José FP | Offchain Labs 
I use docker compose and the command i called

meanwhile... is it the reason the eth is not fully synced btw?
undefined says Hey, I want to run a node on the testnet, according to the documentation the testnet is Goerli, chainID 421613 but I have a doubt if it is the testnet for Arbitrum One or for Arbitrum  Nova?  Do I need  snapshot to start a node with goerli? thank you!
undefined says 
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1105511507367829554
undefined says I've tried replicating your process, but haven't had success yet. Running the docker command creates a directory `/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro` -- does it need to extracted into this?
undefined says your steps say to untar it into the `arb1` folder directly, but it looks like it might need to go into `arb1/nitro`?
undefined says 
undefined says the only difference is I have my mount pointed to `~/data`, not `/data/arbitrum`
undefined says but I figured that shouldn't matter :/
undefined says ok, figured it out:
1. start from a clean mounted directory
2. extract nitro.tar into `arb1/nitro`
3. run docker command without `--init.*` flags
undefined says I think the snapshot .tar structure might have changed since early may?
undefined says Yup, you need sync your l1 node first since your node need to read l1’s calldata.
undefined says Arbitrum goerli is the testnet both for arb1 and arb nova, it used  rollups tech like arb1.
undefined says Hey I have a question about hardware requirements. This is what you recomend:
`Followings specify the minimum hardware configuration required to setup a Nitro full node (not archival):
RAM: 4-8 GB
CPU: 2-4 core CPU (For AWS: t3 xLarge)
Storage: Minimum 1.2TB SSD (make sure it is extendable)
Estimated Growth Rate: around 3 GB per day`

However I am running a Nitro full node since march and this is the total space in use:
`328G`

Any reason?
undefined says Am I paying a 2Tb SSD server for nothing?
undefined says 
undefined says arb1-sequencer.arbitrum .io /rpc": dial tcp6: lookup arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io on 213.186.33.99:53: server misbehavin
undefined says Anyone else having problems?
undefined says Yeah I'm having issues aswell
undefined says This is becoming so frequent
undefined says Only happened twice, sequencer seems to be running at least
undefined says I am back now
undefined says same
undefined says Good
undefined says I need help for this.
undefined says yes.  I run full nodes from snapshots I maintain in minutes for around 400GB disk costs on amazon.  2TB might be for an archive node.
undefined says Yes but they explicitly say that it is for Full node (non archive)
undefined says I think you need double the amount for kicking it up, so if its 400 you may need access to 800 at kickoff but then 400 is enough for now
undefined says my arbitrum nodes that haven't been pruned in a couple of weeks are under 400GB,  but I recovered a TON of space on my first pruning.  Pruning is a newish feature, and the docs may be covering the space needed before we could effectively reclaim up to 70% of our storage.
undefined says if you started early and never pruned I think storage was about 1.7TB
undefined says more for even earlier adopters
undefined says I started early and pruned only 1 time
before pruning was always 400gb
undefined says so I can consider buying a smaller server
undefined says Is customer service available?
undefined says Is there any way to migrate the node? Like taking a snapshot?
undefined says 
undefined says Hallow sir
undefined says Hey guys, I've been trying to download the nitro snapshot (manual) for the past days, but I can't get it to download without failing... even tried doing it through nodejs but no luck there either

Also tried using wget, chrome and Firefox... always encounters connection errors in random points
undefined says Would also be happy to get someone else's prune or something btw
undefined says I am waiting for support for taking a snapshot of my node to migrate
undefined says I keep getting this error
`ERROR[06-18|10:55:07.894] error creating blocks                    err=EOF`

Is that sequencer error or?
undefined says ```

ERROR[06-18|10:56:06.933] error creating blocks                    err=EOF
```
undefined says These are only two logs I get
undefined says Yea if I could get a copy of that, that would be great
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says How about using wget with '--continue' option?
It seems that the download stops because your network is unstable, but it seems possible to download from previous failure point with '-c' option whenever it is disconnected.
undefined says This is because your node is new synced node, but some nodes run a long time without prune will have this large disk storage used, this is to make sure your node can run normally.
undefined says What is the version are you running? Maybe you can use v2.0.14-2baa834 and try again.
undefined says I'm running v2.0.13
undefined says You can try upgrade since we remove this log at v2.0.14 and will give other info which might help to debug.
undefined says Somehow when re-deploying the node it resolved but it seems that I've skipped some blocks 🤷‍♂️
undefined says You can use `--node.dangerous.reorg-to-block int` to let it resync.
undefined says Yea I tried that as well, but for some reason the -c flag wasn't recognised, but I'll check if I have better luck writing the full --continue
undefined says is there a way to take a snapshot or no?
undefined says Just gracefully shutdown your node and that db you can make it as a snapshot.
undefined says so I need to zip the db and that's all
then I put it in a folder and use it with --init-url...
undefined says otherwise official last snapshot how old is it?
undefined says No, just unzip it, and mount that fold to your docker container’s /home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says what about this instead?
undefined says We uploaded them not long ago, but forgot the actual date it is. Won’t earlier than May.
undefined says ok thank you
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Is there a way to have the node shutdown at the end of pruning for a nice snapshot instead of starting to sync ?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Add `--init.then-quit`
undefined says good
undefined says I've been changing me disk to the expensive io2 disks to get synced and then back to gp3 after syncing.   Cuts a lot of time, but haven't seen the bill yet.     Amazon has amazing people ensuring every minute I save gets billed somehow,  I hope I break even.
undefined says Is sequencer websocket endpoint overloaded? I'm seeing bunch of reconnection attempts for last two days, and node (naturally) hiccupping by ~100 blocks every time
undefined says Mmm, we haven't noticed any relevant issue on our end. Are you connected to Arbitrum One's feed?
undefined says yep, forgot to specify
undefined says hey everyone, Orbit very cool just wanted to know more about scalability and what maximum node size you can run
undefined says what do you mean by maximum size?
undefined says cpu and ram
undefined says enable more compute when stylus is out
undefined says like 64 gb ram and 16 cores
undefined says Do we get reward in arb for running a fullnode ?
undefined says there's no real limit on the size of CPU or RAM you use, but of course, most of that computation power and memory will not be utilized beyond a certain size. when it comes to blockchains, you are typically going to be more limited by the state growth of the chain itself rather than on computation or RAM
undefined says Stylus will make more efficient use of the CPU than the EVM does, and it will have a different gas model that helps accommodate this
undefined says no, there is no reward for running a node
undefined says very cool @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs thank you!
undefined says if you are running node for Orbit based L3 with Stylus how you would be able to communicate with L2? I mean to get access to something like Layer Zero
undefined says hopefully at some point LayerZero and other providers will interface with L3s natively; in the meantime, it's always possible to send L3<->L2 messages via the inbox and outbox
undefined says you can also run your own offchain infra to interface between chains if you don't need 100% trustlessness
undefined says where can I read further about inbox and outbox?
undefined says we are still working on expanding the Orbit docs for L3 concepts, but it would help to understand L2 <-> L1 messaging in the meantime. Take a look at https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging and https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging and https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#inboxes-fast-and-slow to get an idea

also, the time for messaging between L3 and L2 will likely be reduced and we're working on interop tooling for L3 <-> L3 messaging as well so stay tuned for that
undefined says thanks a lot
undefined says So, for setup our owned orbit chain, our validator on orbit need to be funded some Eth for submiting state to L2 , am i correct sir ?
undefined says yes it would need some ETH for that. with an AnyTrust config it would be minimal
undefined says @VienNguyen
undefined says So using something like Nova would be cheaper. Nice
undefined says Tks sir so much, so can u help me to clarify some questions 
1.. How many batcher poster address support by Orbit chain ?  is it permissionless or permissioned ?
2. About `Stake Token`, does it mean that a Orbit validator must deposit a mount of a token type specified by the parameter to Orbit's base contract on L2, then the validator also need to stake amount of native token of Orbit chain ? In future, type of deposited token can be any of ERC20 token type ?
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I want to docker build nitro on my mac and run this docker image on linux server, but I got this on my linux server "The requested image's platform (linux/arm64/v8) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64/v4) and no specific platform was requested"
undefined says 
undefined says you built an image for apple arm and want amd64.   Try building the image on your linux system and pushing it back to your mac repository.
undefined says 
undefined says 1. In the process of deploying an Orbit chain, one batch poster would be set. You can add other batch posters as well, but it's a whitelisted permissioned set at the end.
2. The amount would be deposited on underlying L2 contracts as well. As you said currently it's just ETH, but in the future we'll add support for ERC20 tokens as well
undefined says Oh, it seems your Mac is m1 platform while your Linux machine is amd64, you should build it on Linux directly.
undefined says I was told L2s like Arbitrum log your information, is this FUD?
Seems to me that they log the ip in `nitro/wsbroadcastserver/wsbroadcastserver.go`, but I'm not sure as I'm not really savy on that
would that mean nodes can link our ips to our addresses if they wanted?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says I am trying to syncing now and it seems too far away from current block.
How can I start sync from most recent block?
undefined says I'm trying to set up an arbitrum one node. I'm running
```
docker run --rm -it  -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url=<L1_URL> --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar"
```
However it gives me `Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1: permission denied`
I have ran `chmod -fR 777 /data/arbitrum` and also `chmod 777` the entire `/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1 directory`.  Could someone help take a look?
undefined says `mkdir /data/arbitrum
chmod -fR 777 /data/arbitrum
`
You need to this command first.
Did you do it?
undefined says yes i ran this command already
undefined says You are root user now?
undefined says yeah it's the same error under root user too
undefined says oh I didn't run `chmod -fR 777 /data/arbitrum` under root user
undefined says it works now after I did that
undefined says tyty!
undefined says After downloading initial data could you share syncing status?
I have above things so want to know it's same on your side.
undefined says Hey, I think you just sync from that would be ok, because our snapshot is not so latest too.
undefined says 98661304: this is my current blocknumber and now latest blocknumber is 105636996.
It's too far I think.
undefined says Could you share latest tar?
undefined says or link?
undefined says what's best node type for only processing latest transactions with less hardware requirements?
undefined says I don’t think our team upload the latest one, but it’s only 20 days from the latest, so it shouldn’t take so much time.
undefined says Oh, we don’t have that type node.
undefined says It's syncing very slowly...
undefined says Maybe will take I guess 2 days??
undefined says 
undefined says I am try to running a full node I have mounted extra volume on my server but still the data is storing in to server's default volume can anyone help me ?
undefined says path of my volume   ==>  -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says In whch /data is my external mounted volume

undefined says can you help?
undefined says How much data bandwidth is needed for running a full node?
undefined says the chain state grows by about 3GB a day so you'll need enough bandwidth to absorb that, at a minimum
undefined says you're going to have to be more specific about your question
undefined says Ok. So  30 mbps would be enough?
undefined says 30 mbps sounds like your connection speed, which sounds more than sufficient; I thought your concern was about cloud hosting which usually charges for bandwidth
undefined says 
undefined says this is command 
docker run -d -v C:/Users/user/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url "" --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --ws.api=net,web3,eth --init.prune=full --node.staker.enable=false --init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro-pruned.tar"
undefined says "traversing trie database" time is soo long
undefined says there are two root target for bloom filter
undefined says i think should be one pruning target root
undefined says can you check ?
undefined says 
undefined says do you need to be running `--init.prune=full`? that's for serving RPC requests. Otherwise, try with `--init.prune=validator`
undefined says i will check
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs 
When will you guys update `nitro-pruned.tar` this with latest data?
undefined says what is the flag for chainging the database dir for full node ?
undefined says all flags are listed here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/command-line-options
undefined says we don't currently have a set schedule, but usually every couple of months
undefined says Is it possible to set l1 url as wss url not https url?
undefined says I believe a wss url should work
undefined says If I want to change https to wss then I should stop docker run and rerun with new command line?
undefined says the same result. in the previous db such a problem was not is it  possible get  new db?(nitro-pruned.tar)
undefined says at the current speed, synchronization will take 1 week
undefined says gas is spiking
undefined says yes you would need to
undefined says 
undefined says I'm currently syncing an archive node, and started from the archive snapshot. The node has been syncing for many days now, and appears to be only adding about ~4 blocks/sec (`created block ...` in logs). Currently the host is well underutilized in terms of CPU/IO/Memory. The node is currently at around block ~84.3M. The rate of sync feels to be about the same rate as block production. When I check the `eth_syncing` method I get returned `false`. Is this normal? Anything I should check configuration-wise?
undefined says How would I go about syncing up a node from the ground up, executing every block from 0? I dont want to use any snapshots or anything.
undefined says I have a  question about the specs of running an arbitrum node and using a local l1 node as provider vs hosted provider like alchemy and infura.

After syncing is there any speed difference in using a local node vs hosted provider? In the docs it states the following below.

```
When fully synced, the Arbitrum node uses the State Transition Function (STF) to consume transactions coming from the Sequencer feed and creates a new state. It also waits for the L1 batch to be posted. If the L1 batch that is finalized on L1 is different from what the Sequencer published, the node will change the state based on the L1 batched transactions.
```

So that means if I care purely about getting states from the arbitrum node will it not matter if I run a local node vs provider node?
undefined says How to compile arb classic node from the source code?
undefined says that's right, the only speed difference is when catching up to the chain
undefined says Thanks for the reply
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I am running into trouble for launching a private node
I search into channels as well, but didn't find good solution

undefined says this is the whole cmd i use
undefined says I think beta 6 is broken for syncing in this manner. We generally don't recommend running beta releases.  Retry syncing on the latest stable release.
undefined says you'll have to clear your database
undefined says noted, thanks
undefined says I was thinking to contribute by making `kurtosis` package of arbitrum. It is trusted by many chains and being used by devs. 
Is there any builder program or hackathon to support my contribution?
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says i'm looking at nitro.go in the nitro-1 repo.

what are the right params to turn off the default reading from the sequencer feed, and only rely on L1 batch txns and hard reorg with L1? something like . . .? 

--node.inbox-reader.hard-reorg = true.
--node.l1-reader.enable = true
--node.forwarding-target = "null"
undefined says Set --node.feed.input.url=“”
undefined says You can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says I sent. Looking forward to replying
undefined says Okay, i'll go ahead and try. . . 

--node.inbox-reader.hard-reorg = true.
--node.l1-reader.enable = true
--node.feed.input.url=“”

Should give me an L2 node that depends only on my L1's perspective, and L1 reorgs will result in L2 reorgs. This is the right config? just want to confirm
undefined says I suppose 

--node.l1-reader.use-finality-data=false

So my L2 node can determine state even during some L1 network partition / fork using the 'latest' L1 block
undefined says Im sorry?
undefined says Yes, it will follow your l1 rpc’s inbox and rollups contract only.
undefined says It will follow your l1 node’s latest block and safe block when you query to l2 node with latest or safe tags.
undefined says Is there a network requirement to run a arbitrum node is 200Mbps speed up/down good enough?
undefined says are you using docker ?   that could be a bad volume/bind mount.  
If not using docker, your data storage location might not exist, or was copypastad, or typed etc.      Its saying the database isn't found,  so it is likely a error in telling the node software where to find the data directory.
undefined says When developing the ganache-cli can fork arbitrum mainnet however it is not stable . Is there a way to use nitro or another application to fork arbitrum mainnet in a similar way to using ganache to fork?
undefined says It’s enough
undefined says I don’t think now you can use others tools to stable fork arb1 but use our nitro code base.
undefined says Thanks for the reply
undefined says 
undefined says I am running my own arbitrum node. If I try to send a transaction, this error occurs:
`network block skew detected; skipping block events (emitted=105913665 blockNumber106038709)`
What does it mean?
undefined says Hey, can you follow this Troubleshooting guide and copy here the final report?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says I am syncing a arbitrum full node from prune snapshot sync, it worked fine for a couple of hours now I am seeing a ton of unhandled trie error: missing trie nodes xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Any thoughts?
undefined says can you share a screen shot of the errors ?
undefined says 
undefined says Can not but it starts with below and just keeps on repeating

```
Trie prefetcher failed opening trie root =xx err="missing trie node xxx"
Unhandled trie error: missing trie node
```


For my l1 node does it need to be an archive node or can it be a full node?
undefined says It looks like  your L1 node might not be fully synced, can you verify?
undefined says It is fully verfied syncing fine. Could it be my internet? If my internet wasnt stable for a bit there is issue?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs which is the latest snapshot to download, so i can get a node up to sync fast?
undefined says Snapshot list here: https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html
undefined says Do you send any archive request to your node?
undefined says which commands to I have to run to see the output from my node? What do u need?
undefined says You can use docker logs to see any weird logs when you get the errors from your node.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Hi_Guys, we want to launch our project on Arbitrum, for testing our project in arbitrum testnet can someone send me Arbitrum goerli eth. Our project is quite big (for estimation consider project as big as Aave). So we need atleast about 100 arbitrum goerli eth for deploying our project and testing it with our team. It'll be really helpful. Thanks.
undefined says and also I cannot access the websocket, but as u can see I added the port 8548 to the run cammonad so I should be able to access the websocket right?
undefined says we cannot accommodate that kind of request
undefined says To whom should i reach?
undefined says I don't know anywhere where you can get 100 goerli eth these days without paying for it; unfortunately it's become hard to come by. There are faucets, but they're limited. You should look into Sepolia and check some faucets at: https://faucetlink.to/sepolia. But 100ETH is a prohibitive request, your deployment should be nowhere near that, and most of your testing should be conducted against a local dev node; otherwise, you might look at running a test devnet yourself
undefined says To be exact it took us about 4.56 ETH to deploy our project into our local blockchain. Can we at least get 10 ETH for deployment of our project and testing? If yes where can i get it from?
undefined says can you provide me more context on the project? link, etc?
undefined says how much gas is the project to deploy?
undefined says Can i send you message?
undefined says yes
undefined says 
undefined says So this is my troubleshooting report:
undefined says And I cannot access my node via websocket. But as u can see in the docker run command the port for the websocket is set…
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs which docker image should i use? this one `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834`  as said in the official docs for RUNNING A NODE or the last docker tag which is `v2.1.0-beta.6-152b9ff`  ? is there any risk in using the beta? which is the latest stable?
undefined says Use the latest stable referenced in the docs
undefined says You still need to set more flags to start ws: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#important-ports
undefined says What type of rpc method you called and got that errors?
undefined says 
undefined says So I would stop the node with `docker stop <container_id>` and then I have to rerun with `--ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*` but with which command I can rerun without the node will start syncing from snapshot again?
undefined says I am just trying to do a transaction like this: `const tx = await my_contract.swapper(route[1][0], amounts[0], data, {gasLimit: gasLimit, maxFeePerGas: baseFee, maxPriorityFeePerGas: maxPriorityFeePerGas,});`
undefined says That errors (network block skew detected; skipping block events) emitted from @ethersproject/providers, might due to network issues, not the node issues.
undefined says https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ethersproject/providers?activeTab=code
undefined says 
undefined says Why is my nitro-pruned.tar node is not catching the latest block?
undefined says The block number is far away from the main block
undefined says That’s normal, the snapshot isn’t the latest one, we will update it every once in a while.
undefined says Hey, how much arb rewards does early node runners got?
undefined says There is no reward for running fullnode.
undefined says What should i do?
undefined says Would that not affect my transaction?
undefined says Im doing arbitrage
undefined says Your node will sync to the latest state, don’t worry.
undefined says Oh Okay
undefined says I posted this message in the support channel but was directed to post it here:

I ran into an issue where my node stopped syncing. I posted an issue on GH (number 1742), but I am yet to recieve any replies. If anyone in this channel has any experience resolving this issue any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
undefined says Hey,
Looking into it. Will get back to you!
undefined says Thanks for the report! We've followed up with a couple questions to help debug the issue on GitHub
undefined says How to run a node for arbitrium?
undefined says I would like to know it
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node
undefined says Is the arbitrum classic node source code publicly available & are there any build guides? I would really appreciate :>
undefined says Hey, it's important to note that running an Arbitrum classic node is mainly applicable to individuals with specific needs for an archive node and access to classic-related commands. If that's what you need; here is the instructions:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-classic-node
undefined says I have read the docs many times over and unfortunately they do not provide the information I am looking for.
I am looking to **build the arbitrum classic node software from source**. Is that something you could assist me with?
undefined says You might be able to do that using this instruction:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally
but replace the nitro repo w arb classic: 
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-classic
undefined says That will obviously not work as the arbitrum-classic repo does not contain any makefiles.
undefined says Then I don't think we provide support for this but can check w the nitro team to make sure
undefined says Can you check with someone who has worked on the classic codebase and knows about it?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-classic/blob/interview/docs/Installation.md
undefined says the source is in that repo, I've linked you the installation docs
undefined says but we can't provide any further support than the docs already available
undefined says Thank you Plasma. I will look into that
undefined says 
undefined says `received error response from L1 RPC      request="{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"eth_chainId\"}" response=nil err="Post \"linkToRPCHere": dial tcp: lookup rpc.ankr.com on 192.168.1.1:53: read udp 172.17.0.2:52708->192.168.1.1:53: i/o timeout"`
undefined says I am having this issue while trying to run an arbitrum RPC. Tried with different RPCs (using the docker command provided in docs). Any cues why this happens?
undefined says You need to check your l1 rpc, the error is your node cannot connect to the l1 rpc url you provided
undefined says I tried different ones from the chainlist link and they all give the same issue. Makes me think this is a problem from my side.
undefined says All reported timeout error?
undefined says Can you enter the container and try to call that rpc url?
undefined says Yeah will try that and report back
undefined says Thanks
undefined says How long does it take to sync a full node from the snapshot?
undefined says If I remember correctly, it should need around 3 days.
undefined says `wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`
is this still valid to subscribe to evenbts?
undefined says You need to run a node to access the the feed
undefined says Yes I have a node already running. Then i have to run a feed relay correct?
undefined says That's correct. You'd run a feed relay which lets you subscribe to an uncompressed sequencer feed for real-time data as the sequencer accepts and orders transactions off-chain.
undefined says so which is the difference from subscribing to sequencer feed directly?
undefined says because I tried to connect directly su the sequencer feed with websocket and worked
undefined says yea connecting to a websocket port 9642 of the local relay lets you do that. Running a feed relay is generaly recommended if you run more than one node
undefined says no I mean this:
I can directly subscribe on wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
undefined says is it better than useing a feed relay correct?
undefined says Are there instructions of how to connect to sequencer feed of my node via websocket (node js)? -> I am running the code `docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed --l2.chain-id=42161` on the vps where my node is running.
And it would be great if in the example transactions from the sequencer are read. Thank you guys
undefined says To give some more information -> If I run `wscat -c ws://localhost:9642` on my vps i think it is running correctly. But if I try to setup the ethers websocket like this: 
`let provider_seq = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider(  ws://vps_ip_address:9642)`
I am only getting the message ``this should not happen. What am I doing wrong?
undefined says Do you run those 2 steps in the same machine/ip? If not, can you use wscat connect to your feed node on the machine you run that ethersjs code?
undefined says The feed relayer will also subscribe that url, feed relayer is used when you have multiple nodes which all need feed message, use a relayer will reduce the network cost.
undefined says Perfect so if I have only 1 node I don't need it. I can directly subscribe to arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
undefined says Yup
undefined says ok thank you.
undefined says First step with localhost I was running on the vps where my node is running.
The second step with connecting via ip address of the vps where my node is running I am using my own pc (So the command `let provider_seq = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider(  ws://vps_ip_address:9642` was not running on the vps where my node is running
undefined says If so, you need to check if that port is open and the rules of your firewall
undefined says I am running full node for the first time and noticed that I forgot to add  a snapshot parameter  --init.url

Now it looks like the node synchronized only about 25% of blocks and may run synchronization process a couple of days more.. Is it wise to stop it and restart from scratch with snapshot image supplied? Would that speedup the process?
undefined says Yeah it worths it to stop and do it with snapshot
undefined says Is it possible to reduce storage needs? The node consumes 4 tb of storage. Insane
undefined says Ok i found it
undefined says 
undefined says Hey guys, did you guys met "429 Too Many Requests" which pointing to own node RPC? Is it any config that able to increase the rate limit for own node. Thank you.
undefined says Hey, how many nodes are you running now in the same public ip?
undefined says Firewall is deactivated I think. At least running `sudo ufw status` is giving the response: `Status: inactive`
So it should be needed to open the port right?
undefined says Yes
undefined says So what could be the issue then? Is it possible to connect via ethers.providers:WebSocketProvider(...) to the port 9642?
undefined says Oh, so you want to use ethers to get feed messgaes? You can only use ethers to get rpc service by 8548
undefined says ethers can't read your feed message
undefined says ah ok. What service would you recommend to use? Should be fast.
undefined says You can also use your node to do that by activating ws (8548) config: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#important-ports
undefined says But I am running websocket on port 8548 already and it is working well.
To access 9642 I need to add 
--ws.port=9642
--ws.addr=0.0.0.0
--ws.origins=*
to the run command?
undefined says any news on this?
undefined says and I saw Offchain Labs is looking for solidity engineer.
undefined says yes feel free to apply; partnerships team is currently at ETHCC in Paris so they may take a while to get back to you; if you have a product ready to go to market or currently deployed happy to bump it to their attention; otherwise, Arb Foundation is planning an online hackathon soon so you might want to look at that
undefined says If you want to access feed message by ethersjs, that is not work because ethersjs doesn’t support decode our feed messages.
undefined says is it normal that every time the classic node restarts, it takes 9 hours to fully load the machine from DB?
undefined says of Anyone has a storage problem when running the Arbitrum node?

I have running an Arbitrum Nitro node and the daily disk storage cost nearly 30Gb, but the official document shows daily blockchain data around 3Gb, is there anyone  help me?
undefined says Yes, it’s normal, classic node needs do a lot of work to check and initial.
undefined says Are you running archive node?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Ok thanks that works now. Am I able to read transaction data from sequencer feed? Like on which dex, which amount, which tokens and so on? 
Cannot find that info on the website
undefined says Go to your pruning and set it there
undefined says you can read it, and you can find more details here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says as for interpreting it in terms of which contract is being interacted with, you will have to program that logic yourself as it requires an ABI to interpret the calldata correctly. It's true many contracts publish their ABIs to Etherscan/Arbiscan, but you'll have to pull those in on your script for whatever contract you want to monitor
undefined says Is there a javascript example as well? I dont know the Go language and it is very difficult to read the huge Go-script
undefined says Hey! Super random question but we have a Traefik instance running which routes traffic to our nodes. I can hit all my polygon, eth, mumbai etc nodes but when I try hit the host for my arb node it returns a 404. Doesn't seem to be a traefik setup issue, is there any command line flags that would interfear and or enable this? I am able to curl the latest block if I hit the node directly
undefined says ```
--l1.url=http://{l1-ip}:8545 --l2.chain-id=42170 --node.feed.input.url=wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```

^ current command line ops
undefined says Did you set the port? What path are you hitting? Have you tried manually making an RPC request against the node?
undefined says I am able to hit the port just fine if I go directly yeah
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs traefik is setup exactly the same for the other nodes. Not certain why but I am just hitting the http://IP:8547 from inside traefik and nothing happens / will get a 404. If I hit the box directly, it works great
undefined says Almost seems as if it isn't sending the response back to the proxy or something of the sort. Cause it seems like it reaches arbitrum but nothing is ever sent back
undefined says Have tried everything. Anyone run into something similar?
undefined says I'm looking for a infra hosting service to run arbitrum node in affordable budget. Where do you recommend?
undefined says is hetzner the cheapest?
undefined says hey there, can someone tell me what is Nitro genesis block for  nitro-archive.tar ? apparently, it is not the same as for mainnet
undefined says I have a problem with Arb Full node 
1)_ I have already setup Arb Full node Docker for L2 (discord not allow to post link here)
2)_ I have already setup Nethermind Docker for L1  (discord not allow to post link here)

Everything seem be good, i can start those dockers and all necessary services also, such as: 8545 (netherum), 8547 (arb one)
2.1_ The first problem is: I can not create new account address (personal_newAccount) via Arb L2 w/ port 8547. I get error 
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "error": {
        "code": -32000,
        "message": "local keystore not used"
    }
}
Then, i have used netherum (L1 to create account w/ the same method (w/ port 8545) , it's work well. But i got the second problem as below:
2.2_ When i transfer token/eth, the balance can't update, that's mean i can not get its balance. But Arbscan shown correct of Balance, Txt transactions are also shown correct, networks already confirmed..... But i got balance still is zero.

Thanks so much for your help!

undefined says can you help?
undefined says It’s the same
undefined says It nay be a db corruption. Have you shot down your node ungracefully?
undefined says i sync first time using --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar"
undefined says Have you used your own L1 node?
undefined says I want to subscribe to the sequencer feed for confirmed transactions. Do I need a special node for that? I'm using an arbitrum node and subscribing to pending txns. Watch should I subscribe to ?
undefined says If you are running a node, you just need to query your node’s rpc for tx receipt, you node will subscribe to the feed.
undefined says What if instead of running a node I subscribe to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed wouldn't that be faster ? But then I guess I would need to decode the sequencer msgs
undefined says Because your node also subscribes to this url, and if you only subscribe to the feed, it only gives you the tx, not the tx receipt, you won’t know the status/output of that tx.
undefined says I see thanks!
undefined says 
undefined says no ethereum.publicnode.com
undefined says I tried to sync with Genesys db, everything works, the problem is on the latest pruned.tar, can you help I haven't been able to sync for a month now
undefined says 
undefined says can you elaborate please why the block 22207817 which is stated as nitro genesis block in the documentation, refers to May 26th, 2023? goerli.arbiscan.io/block/22207817
undefined says Is there a javascript example as well? I dont know the Go language and it is very difficult to read the huge Go-script
undefined says That’s Arbitrum One genesis block number, Aug-31-2022:  https://arbiscan.io/block/22207817
undefined says I'm afraid not. We don't support retrieving or parsing the sequencer feed messages outside of the node software.
undefined says I am sorry, I just noticed that my question is a bit confusing. In fact I need to know genesis block number for goerli testnet. I haven't found that in the documentation and have no idea if I can fetch this via RPC api
undefined says That's alright ser, Arb Goerli's nitro genesis block number is 0: https://goerli.arbiscan.io/block/0
You could also find these info using our SDK:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/ec33a863926cc862ba2871096ea72865c12314e9/src/lib/dataEntities/networks.ts#L168

Is it something I need to worry and fix?
undefined says The logs say it is rebuiding, so you need to wait and it may take some time.
undefined says Hey guys, may i ask how to compile nitro without using the dokerfile ?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally, if you just want to run node without docker, you don't need to do step 5, and at step 7, you can type`make target/bin/nitro`
undefined says ho, thanks, i'm sorry i didnt see this part in the docs.
undefined says I subscribe to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed , and add  header  Sec-WebSocket-Extensions:  permessage-deflate  Why doesn't it work?
undefined says Hey, can you provide more details on your problem? Like what error do you get, if you connect to the feed or not, ...
undefined says i subscribe to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed ,  it get  uncompressed sequencer feed, but i want get an compressed feed,  the data packet will be small
undefined says no error,   the header param value: permessage-deflate not effect
undefined says What are you using to connect to the feed? (ws, websocat, ...)
undefined says WebSocket
undefined says i try wss on postman, also use  java and go to test
undefined says Let me check a few things and I'll get back to you
undefined says tks
undefined says so I am running a full archive node with this command:
sudo docker run -d -it -v /home/blockchain-user/arbitrum-node/data/:/home/user/.arbitrum --restart=unless-stopped --name arbitrum-node -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url=***goerli.infura.io/v3/**edited** --l2.chain-id=421613 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.caching.archive --init.url=file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro-archive.tar

My node times out on getLogs call. Same call returns almost instantly from Infura RPC. My node is fully synced, i.e. eth_syncing returns false
Could you please suggest where to look at as the possible cause of that issue? Thank you
undefined says offtop: guys, content blocking function here is really annoyning. I had hard time posting my message 🤪
undefined says I recently saw:
```Jul 26 14:25:20 arbitrum[3096748]: ERROR[07-26|14:25:20.118] Server connection timed out without receiving data url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="read tcp XXXX:60926->1>

```
And it took about 30 seconds to reconnect. I am running a single node. Is there a way to protect against this?
undefined says Can you send the command you're using to run your node?
undefined says Can you send the actual RPC call you're doing? (the json request would be best)
undefined says 
undefined says ```offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url X.X.X.X:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --metrics```
undefined says Have you ruled out local network issues? I'm not aware of any sequencer feed issues right now.
If your node is consuming a lot of resources can also cause these I/O errors
undefined says Not that i saw, but my nodes is in APAC. Could be a transiant internet issue. Is it possible for you to take a look at 
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1133771616585797792
undefined says Alright. It's not a very big problem as the node recovers itself once it receives the data from the feed again, but yeah, if it happens very often, you should try to see if you can better manage the resources consumed by the node.
(I'll take a look at your other question)
undefined says 🙏 Will do and ty!
undefined says ```{"method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"fromBlock":"0x1E3659C","toBlock":"latest","address":"0x9c237eb0cd21e50b7c75ac7011c2d5fd347adc95","topics":["0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"]}],"id":44,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}```
undefined says Most public RPCs (including Infura) have their own log caching infrastructure. Go-ethereum's log queries out of the box are quite slow. I thinkj this is expected behavior when you're querying logs over 2/3 of the entire history of the chain.
undefined says I might be missing something, if so kindly correct me but isn't block  0x1E3659C stands for 31,679,900 in decimal and timestamp is Jul-25-2023 11:19:31 AM +UTC ? It is only a bit more than 1 day range
undefined says Is this for arbitrum one or another network? On arb1 it's from 2022 https://arbiscan.io/block/31679900
undefined says hmm, I see, it is arbgoerli
undefined says That is unexpected then. Is there anything in the logs of the node during this time? I'm assuming other log queries complete quickly?
undefined says Yes, this is Goerli. Yes, other calls complete quickly, I tested eth_getLogs with "fromBlock" set to 5 minutes old block, also tested a simple ETH transfer between accounts. Everything works fine except getting logs for a day range (I haven't tested what is the longest working interval though). 
In the node logs, I do not see any records during failure, just regular "created block" stuff
undefined says Hey, so when connecting directly to the feed you can only use the uncompressed feed, as we use a custom compression scheme. You can, however, run a relay which will handle the compression of the feed, and then read the messages from that relay => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-feed-relay
undefined says Thank you so much, i will try
undefined says We have configured a fullnode. And we realised that our latest block is usually 2 blocks behind the actual latest block. Is there any solution to this?
undefined says The problem remains, unfortunately. I don't know how the node database works internally, that it can't fetch 1 day old data, but maybe it still doesn't retain historical data despite I run it in archive mode? Any help much appreciated, thank you
undefined says Hey guys, I'm having some issues setting up a classic archival node from snapshot.

```

As you can see the L2 block value is UINT128_MAX value which probably means some problem parsing the DB files.
The node then gets stuck on this log indefinitely, I have tried multiple times to run the node with different flags, re-downloaded the classic-archive.tar file and unpacked it again, tried enabling debug logs. Nothing.

Did anyone else come across this problem? Catching up from genesis takes far too long unfortunately.
undefined says (This is the run command used, I unpacked the tar into the volume `arbitrum-classic`)
```
docker run --rm -it -d  -v arbitrum-classic:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url=http://${L1_URL}:8545 --node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream
```
undefined says it can take hours to days to initially load from that message, depending on the latency of your storage volume. Solid state is ideal with less than 100us latency recommended. Unfortunately there are no logs while that process is occurring, so you'll have to be patient even though it looks frozen
undefined says Thanks for responding, does this log line make sense to you?
```

How is 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 a valid L2 block number?
undefined says You can just wait your node to recover, next time you can use graceful shutdown for better.
undefined says The latest block that the node syncs is 2 blocks slower than the actual block. Is there any way to improve this problem. Looking forward to your support @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says This is mostly network delay, you can try reduce the delay like change a location.
undefined says Thanks for your answer. Let me try the location
undefined says any suggestions from anyone? It looks like resetting container and syncing the node from scratch doesn't help either..
undefined says It is the first time I'm starting the node though, I literally just extracted the classic-archive.tar and started up the node.
There was no restart or shutdown.
Restoring Nitro from the official snapshot works (almost) perfectly out of the box by the way, it's just the classic archival node which doesn't load the DB no matter what I try (catching up from genesis is far too slow).
undefined says Oh, sorry, I missed that, you need to wait it initial, classic node need take a few hours (sometimes more than one day) to initialize.
undefined says ok I'll try giving it the weekend and hopefully it'll sort itself out, thanks
undefined says Suppose I want to improve my latency with the sequencer, as it stands there is currently one centralized sequencer, is it particularly located somewhere ?
undefined says I am curious about that either
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Are there possibly any docs for running a build of the node outside of docker?  Specifically for extending the internal geth functionality quicker than full docker builds?
undefined says I have question about Nova network, dose Nova network have testnet? Thanks guys.
And can I setup my Nova mainnet fullnode?
undefined says Hey, here's some documentation about building the nitro codebase and generating a custom docker image => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally
undefined says Nova doesn't have any testnet, although the tech stack is also Nitro (the same as Arb Goerli and Arb One, with the addition of the Data Availability Committee). To set up your fullnode for Nova you can follow these instructions => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node
undefined says Yeah, was hoping to build it _outside_ of docker.  Just changing a few small things in golang (should be a fast rebuild), but since it modifies an early layer in docker, takes 2-3 minutes to compile/build the full image again.
undefined says Is there some estimate as to how much storage a Nitro Archival node requires?
The docs say 2TB but my caught-up from snapshot archival node is already at 4.9TB and going strong.

Is that normal?
undefined says The amount on Doc is a bit old and the Archive growth is ~14 Gb/day on average. So make sense to be around that
undefined says Iirc, after building you can produce go binaries by running "make build" . Then you'd have those binaries in "/target/bin". Running the "nitro" binary should behave the same as the docker image. I haven't done this in a while though.
undefined says Appreciate the help.  Thats what I expected as well, but have been running into constant snags there.  I'll parse through that Dockerfile and see what exactly the problem is I guess 🙂
undefined says Does eth_sendRawTransaction sends to the sequencer directly? Or do I need to set up the node in order for to be sent to the sequencer RPC url? I asked in the Protocol chat but I think that is the wrong place to ask sorry.
undefined says I'm seeing a lot of "context cancelled" errors when making multiple eth_getBalance calls to the classic node. Is there a way to increase the timeout of RPC calls on the classic node? Or anything else should I do?
undefined says This might be either (1) an issue with your L1's rpc for which you have to check your RPC service or change it to another one, or (2) that L2 RPC is being heavily bombarded w requests.
undefined says hey guys is theer any specific parameter that improves the perfomance of RPC node which i serving a lot of requests ?
undefined says It should be (2). I make many requests in parallel on random blocks. Any ideas to keep a high QPS without the "context cancelled" errors?
undefined says Okay, thanks
undefined says You can send eth_sendRawTransaction to both endpoints, but the node will just forward it to the sequencer endpoint.
undefined says I'd say it depends on the nature of the issue you might be having. For example, if it is high latency because of memory usage, there are a couple of flags that you can play with to increase cache size, like --node.caching.database-cache . You can see a full list of available flags in https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/command-line-options , and you can ask any doubts in here.
But I'd recommend to fully determine the issue you want to solve first.
undefined says Do you have any other logs before the "context cancelled" errors/warnings? (I'm not sure now, but iirc, they were warnings as a result of serving an rpc request, and the node would log the actual error before that warning)
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks I will check it . I have a problem with pruning when I start the container with `--init.prune full` I get the below error 
```
error initializing database              err="error pruning: failed to find root to retain for pruning: refusing to prune to full-node level when validator is enabled (you should prune in validator mode)"
```
but the node is not a validator node
undefined says ```docker run -it -d -v /home/ARBITRUM/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8518:8548 -p 8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url xxx  --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*  --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*  --node.caching.database-cache 16256```
undefined says Yeah, the message is a bit misleading. The node is by default in watchtower mode, and the pruning feature takes a watchtower node as a validator. With `--init.prune validator` it should work.
Alternatively, you can disable watchtower mode with `--node.staker.enable=false` and it would prune with the "full" option
undefined says will the node continue to sync when its pruning or does it wai for pruning to complete before starting to sync ? and how long does it take to prune ?
undefined says Pruning is an offline process, and the node does so first. After it finishes pruning, it will resume syncing. As for how long, it will depend on how much it has to prune, but you can see the progress in the log, iirc.
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says Node command: docker run -it  -v /home/ec2-user/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 -d --restart unless-stopped offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url ***eth.llamarpc.com --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="***/nitro-pruned.tar"

Check for memory usage too, in case it's lagging due to low memory.

undefined says how to check node sync status?
undefined says You can use eth_syncing for that => https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#how-can-i-verify-that-my-node-is-fully-synced
undefined says 
undefined says for full node, is there any requirement of storage iops and throughout?
undefined says I have read the arbitrum docs in the website for reading the sequencer. It seems that the sequencer only gives me the transaction with position block: 1 and the rest I can't receive it. How can I make it send all the txns?
undefined says Is it possible that the sequencer does not forward all txns?
undefined says yes, see: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-an-archive-node#system-requirements
undefined says You need to call the sequencer via the JSON-RPC URL, see https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers#rpc-endpoints for the URL for each chain
undefined says in l2msg  I notice that the first byte is either 3 or 4 what do these mean? (the sequencer decoder checks if it is either 3 or 4 and label it as kind)
undefined says 
undefined says Would 4 refer to 'signed_tx' and 3 refer to 'Batch'. What are the difference between these two types of l2msg Kind? Thanks
undefined says If I initiate a signed_tx transaction on arbitrum can it go into the 'Batch 3' category or does batch only have transaction resulting from ContractTx Calls (People that call smart contracts)?
undefined says I've been running a node for a little while and the node itself seems to run fine. The log states "created block ..." without any errors.

The problem I'm having is in using my node as an RPC. I opened ports 8547, 8548, and 9642. But when trying to send a call to the node I get a connection refused error. I disabled the firewall on the node to troubleshoot the issue but still get the error.

The discord server keeps rejecting my messages for unallowed text but I can't figure out why so I didnt' include any code. Below is my docker command. Any help would be appreciated.
undefined says ```sudo docker run -d -it -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834

undefined says 
undefined says Hey it's message kinds and you can find them here:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/libraries/MessageTypes.sol
undefined says Why does the arbitrum node need a connection to eth node? Also is it important that this eth node be fast, i.e will it influence the speed of my arb node ? thankss
undefined says 2 questions i'm intrested to learn...
1. is the L2 used in arbitrum something they developed entirely new? (BFT, consensus and all..)
2. were there rollback that happened in L2? if so how many and when... is there any public infotmation about it?
undefined says Hey, for the first question, we don't have consensus like pos, however, when there is validator choose to cheat, we use fraud proof to make sure the state recorded on l1 is correct: https://docs.arbitrum.io/proving/challenge-manager. 2. L2 node can read l1 da and execute it on their local env, so if your node is honest, you will never roolback.
undefined says Thanks for the reply! 
about being honest, was there any occusion where in Arbitrum there was a rollback ? does it happen a lot if any? any statistics about it?
undefined says Once the tx recorded to l1, there won't be any rollback, because evm is single-threading, which means we know the tx input and there order, there must be one and only one final state, so if your nodes honest and read those da then execute, they all will get only one state. Only if ethereum rollback, which will result in arbitrum rollback due to some tx recorded on l1 lost.
undefined says when I send a tx via my node, I get this message: INFO [08-04|20:09:39.747] Submitted transaction
What does it mean? It's when the sequencer has received my tx and is going to process it?
undefined says And what's the purpose of  "--node.seq-coordinator.enable" ?
undefined says Hey, is there a snapshot for arbitrum archival node?
undefined says hmmm classic snap seems to be failing 
```curl: (18) transfer closed with 446360479744 bytes remaining to read
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive```
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html
undefined says For running a sequencer and coordinating which sequencer is active among multiple instances for high availability
undefined says It means your node just submitted a new tx to sequencer. --node.seq-coordinator.enable is used for sequencers to handle failover, it'd only be useful if you were running a sequencer for an Orbit chain.
undefined says Did you have error when download the snapshot?
undefined says ```db/478376.sst
 41  612G   41  254G    0     0  48.2M      0  3:36:41  1:30:10  2:06:31 47.9M
curl: (18) transfer closed with 383661844480 bytes remaining to read
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now```
undefined says 
undefined says Oh, you have errors when download the snapshot, you need to download again.
undefined says yeah I tried 4 times, didn't happen with previous snap  on snapshot.arbitrum  dot io / using curl and piping in tar with entrypoint.sh  😭  but all good, dl'd with aria and extracting with that now.
undefined says How about using some download tools which can resume downloading if error thrown?
undefined says worked with aria it resumes. all good now 👍
undefined says I read this on arb docs
"So anyone who trusts the Sequencer to keep its promises can rely on the feed to get instant information about the transaction sequence--and they can run the sequenced transactions through the state transition function to learn the results of each transaction immediately. This is "soft finality" for transactions; it's "soft" because it depends on the Sequencer keeping its promises."
So, do we need to config our node to by default trust the sequencer and run the state transition functions automatically  or is this config default?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Your node will subscribe sequencer feed by default
undefined says "and they can run the sequenced transactions through the state transition function to learn the results of each transaction immediately"
undefined says is this done by default as well?
undefined says Yes
undefined says what are the ways we can do to ensure that our block syncs the fastest? We have been doing some tests: we record the latest block in our node (X) and send a transaction to the blockchain. Our transaction is always X + 3 blocks.
undefined says Where Can I find pending txns in Arbitrum. Like in Ethereum it's on etherscan.io/txsPending
undefined says Syncing speed can vary depending on multiple factors. You can find the minimum hardware requirements to run your node here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#minimum-hardware-configuration. You should also verify your network and disk speed.
undefined says Unlike Ethereum, Arbitrum does not have a mempool. Our Sequencer receives  txs from nodes and queues/orders them on a first come first served manner. But this queue is private so you can't have access to the pending txs.
undefined says this is too generic. we are running an ec2 instance on AWS
undefined says there must be ways for us to achieve X + 1?
undefined says if I run a full node, is there any RPC method like `trace_block` ?
undefined says debug_traceBlockByNumber
undefined says We follow geth's trace rpc
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I notice that on average, the sequencer takes 3 blocks to recognise our transaction. why is that the case?
undefined says I also noticed that at Jul-26-2023 02:03:12 AM +UTC, starting from block 114975782, in that 1 second, there were 14 blocks. Why was that so?
undefined says The sequence has a tx queue, so 3 blocks is waiting time and network deny time (from your rpc node to sequencer).
undefined says 3 blocks is about 750ms
undefined says This might because local timestamp updates issue, we have minimum block time 0.25 s.
undefined says does the sequencer send any confirmation message when it receives our transaction?
undefined says Yes, your node will receive feed message: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says the feed basically sends us the transaction sequence right? so our node basically processes the feed to update the blockchain state?
undefined says Correct
undefined says does the sequencer have a maximum transactions per block? or does it just wrap a block after every 250ms?
undefined says 32m computational gas
undefined says thanks. what does it mean?
undefined says The block has 32m computational gas limit (l1 is 30m), the gas on l2 has computaional part and l1 calldata part.
undefined says Thanks Jason. Is it possible for us to send a transaction directly to the sequencer, i.e. skipping the node?
undefined says Use rpc node is the recommand way or you can send to our public rpc: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says actually we have our own nodes. but as I said, we see our transactions are taking 3 blocks to be recorded by the blockchain. So, is it possible to send transactions directly to the Sequencer on L2?
undefined says what is the requirements to run the validator ?
undefined says you can run watchtower validator now, it is the same requirement as geth: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node
undefined says You can try public rpc
undefined says server specs?
undefined says if we send to a public RPC, isn't the public RPC required to send our transactions to a node before the sequencer too?
undefined says where I can stake my tokens ?
undefined says what's the minimum stake required to become a validator ?
undefined says Minimum 1.2TB SSD (make sure it is extendable)
undefined says I mean this one: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says It's white list now.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I wrote an email to partnership department of Arbitrum and got no reply
undefined says regarding to Kurtosis integration of Arbitrum.
undefined says thanks Jason. What is this actually?
undefined says isn't it supposed to connect to a node too?
undefined says This rpc is running by us, and if you think your node has latency on this, you can try build your node on US which may reduce some latency.
undefined says Now on arbitrum can I run mainnet validator ?
undefined says who are allowlisted validators ?
undefined says Is there some way to run Arbitrum Nitro node without docker?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node

Kindly check this Doc.
undefined says technically yes, but there's lots of dependencies and we don't offer support for that
undefined says I want to do a full sync of arbitrum one from nitro genesis. However, when I start up the node, it starts creating blocks from 116,965,377 (per the logs). Is there something I need to do to start from 22207817?

my launch command: 
```nitro --chain.id=42161 --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar" --parent-chain.connection.url="<snip>" --node.caching.archive```
undefined says i want tod a full arbitrum one node,  before start it, i download  nitro.tar
undefined says 
undefined says my launch: docker run --privileged --rm -it -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -v /data/arbitrum_init_tar:/jira/arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.5-208d9d5 --l1.url="h ttp://172.17.0.1:8545" --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug,admin --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.feed.input.url="wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed"    --init.url="file:/jira/arbitrum/nitro.tar" --node.rpc.classic-redirect="h ttps://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/rwQ5PfDeqB11Ptak2pb_SEI0zR9TjZXH"

undefined says Then don't work ~
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Post "(http(s))(://)arb1-sequencer(dot)arbitrum(dot)io/rpc": dial tcp6: lookup arb1-sequencer(dot)arbitrum(dot)io: i/o timeout
got that error when sending transaction, tried it several times, why it happened ?

got no issue pinging the host
undefined says Have a question. Nitro can only be started with docker ?
undefined says docker is much simpler~
undefined says No help here.
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Could you try upgrading your nitro image, we are at offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834
undefined says Is this error from your node logs?
undefined says If you want to sync from genesis, you should use this snapshot: https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-genesis.tar
undefined says 
undefined says no, it comes on my app. 
I'm using golang `err = web3Send.SendTransaction(ctxz, signedTx)`
it comes from `err` variable
undefined says eth_sendRawTransaction is supported via that url, can you check your network config? Btw, you can also see if your node can forward correctly.
undefined says thank you very much!   It seems to be working now!
undefined says 
undefined says It should be normal now, right?
undefined says yes
undefined says anyone got a query I can run to just externally test connection to node
undefined says I can't find how to contruct this from the docs
undefined says heres an example for ethereum:
`curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' <node-URL>`
undefined says 
undefined says ah right, this basically works for Arbitrum too, lol
`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":false}`
docs: search for  'json-rpc-comparisons'
undefined says when i Subscribe topics, there was no message   push to me
undefined says On its own node
undefined says 
undefined says docker run --privileged --rm -it -v /data/eth/arbitrum_one:/home/user/.arbitrum  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url="....:8545" --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*
undefined says Maybe your node is still syncing, you can check your node's block height first
undefined says yes~   the sync is complete~  block height is the latest
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs    Before I was downloading nitro-pruned.tar  to sync updates~
undefined says 
undefined says It seems your node syncing has some issues because the block number doesn't match to the correct block hash, you might need to resync
undefined says I'm sorry. What am I supposed to do?
undefined says delete your state db and resync
undefined says ok~
undefined says thanks
undefined says 
undefined says Suppose I forgot to add optional paramters such as --node.forwarding-target=<sequencer RPC>. Do I need to reinstall the node completely or can I change the parameters?
undefined says You can change the params by just restarting the process with the new args
undefined says 
undefined says To stop the previous node I had running I used docker compose down . After performing the changes on the docker-compose.yml file I started the node as docker compose up ? Will the node start syncing resuming to where it was left off, or will it download everything again? Reason is I don't want to use too much storage
undefined says I'd recommend adding a `-t 300` to give the node more time to gracefully shutdown like described in https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#putting-it-all-together. It's talking about docker there, but docker-compose takes the same arg. For the node to be persistent across restarts when running in docker you need to make sure that a local directory is mounted or else the db won't be saved across restarts. There are instructions on how to do that with docker at that same link if you don't already have that setup
undefined says Well for now it keeps downloading the intial data base again and again. I dont mind if it downloads it again as long as the previous volumes are removed from storage. If I understand well adding -t 300 will allow node to make necessary actions so that it can resume syncing ?
undefined says Docker disks aren't persistent by default. If you want to retain the state, you should mount a local volume. In the link I wrote, eg, it recommends for docker including `-v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum`.  Docker compose supports something similar https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#use-a-volume-with-docker-compose
undefined says The `-t 300` will only matter if you're mounting a local disk. What it does is make sure the node has enough time to shutdown cleanly to avoid corruption risk, but that only matters if you're saving the chain state across restarts by using a volume mount
undefined says curl "URL"   -X POST   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"arbtrace_filter","params":[{"fromBlock":"0x7258E68","toBlock":"0x7258E69"}],"id":"1"}'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","error":{"code":-32000,"message":"arbtrace calls forwarding not configured"}}

How do I fix this ?
undefined says It looks like you're trying to trace a recent block using classic `arbtrace_*` RPC methods. Nitro uses `debug_*` instead.
undefined says I was hoping someone could better help me understand the --node.forwarding-target argument. In a post in the #💻︱protocol it was ⁠mentioned  as a way to send to the sequencer. I thought my node by default was sending to the sequencer directly. Am I missing something here?
undefined says I must be doing something wrong
undefined says This IPC stuff is a big mess, can I instead create an HTTPS or WSS url to connec to my node ?
undefined says Basically I activated sudo ufw allow 8547
undefined says I would want to get the wss url
undefined says Answered in #💻︱protocol
undefined says You mean you cant connect your node through public ip right? If so, could you check: 1. Can you check your node log to make sure your node is running correctly. 2. If you can connect it on your node's local network. 3. Can you check your docker mapping url is 0.0.0.0 not 127.0.0.1?
undefined says No I mean how can I connect to my node via https or wss locally I'm a newbie
undefined says do I simply use https::localhostXXX as my url ?
undefined says Connect via rpc? And if you are in the same version, just localhost:8547 is ok
undefined says Here is the rpc docs: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/
undefined says Thanksu I mean to connect to my node I would use Provider::<Http>::try_from("http://localhost:8545")?
undefined says The url is correct ?
undefined says Arbitrum http port is 8547 by default
undefined says Ok thankss yes, for the wss node I would need to setup my docker file with the necessary flags but then it would be the same just using wss:://localhost:8545
undefined says yes
undefined says thanks a lot, last question there really is no difference between running an ipc node and just listening to https in the port locally right ?
undefined says You mean rpc node? Yes, we support ethereum rpc methods
undefined says I mean you can use an ipc path as the node url, or https I guess theres no difference between the two
undefined says ipc is kinda different because you are using docker to run, you need mount the icp dir to your host machine
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs just curious, does our L1 RPC endpoint affect our sync speed?
undefined says Yes, it will, when your node syncing, it will read l1 to get previous tx info.
undefined says I didn't mean the initial sync speed to get the full node started; I meant the ongoing updating our full node with new blocks
undefined says That depends on the feed
undefined says I guess so too. So our sync speed after the initial sync only depends on the feeder?
undefined says For the real time state, yes, but it also depends on your disk latency and your network status
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Are there any plans to remove the requirement to download a snapshot of the classic blocks *separately* (not in the normal node sync process) for running a Nitro full node soon?
undefined says I would like to integrate Arbitrum nodes into NiceNode and any setup simplification would help
undefined says Yep, support for fast syncing is under development which will allow arbitrum nodes to purely sync p2p like ethereum nodes do
undefined says Wonderful. Thank you
undefined says One more Q, any rough eta for this?
undefined says Can't say we have a specific ETA, hopefully by the end of the year
undefined says 
undefined says can you fix your feed please?  `Server connection timed out without receiving data url         wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="read tcp`
happened on two different nodes
undefined says I am having issues with my nodes connecting
undefined says Yep same as above
undefined says it's really crappy that you're still dependent on a single point of failiure even when running your own nodes....
undefined says not really my idea of a decentralized network
undefined says Same thing here, multiple nodes failing...
undefined says cc @Arbitrum Support
undefined says Arbiscan looks to be having the same issue, hasn't had block updates in 5+ minutes
undefined says I assume its pretty widespread?
undefined says Something is wrong with my arbitrum node. It cannot run correctly anymore

WARN [08-17|22:54:36.722] Caller gas above allowance, capping      requested=61,995,929 cap=61,647,200
ERROR[08-17|22:54:36.966] Server connection timed out without receiving data url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="read tcp 172.17.0.2:36454->104.22.65.211:443: i/o timeout"
undefined says @Arbitrum Support any updates on this?
undefined says Are there any alternate sequencer endpoints that we can use if this happens again?
undefined says aaand its fixed?
undefined says Just started up as I started looking into the issue.
undefined says batches not being posted for an hour at that time, but now it's restored
undefined says and any plans to stop this from happening in the future? It's not the first time that the feed timed out...
undefined says Yeap, we learn from every time something like this happens and apply the measures to prevent that from happening again. Keep in mind that this was just the batchposter not posting batches on L1 during that time, but L2 blocks were still being processed.
undefined says Can anyone help with the error
undefined says Your command looks fine, so it might be a networking issue, are you able to connect to that endpoint outside of docker?
undefined says I think it was more than just the batchposter, the endpoints for the feed weren't working at all.  Could connect to the endpoint, but it would timeout with a 504 with no data received, and immediately reconnect to the same effect...
undefined says Yea we were not getting up to date blocks during that time, which is more of an issue than just the batch poster not working.
undefined says We're running a graph protocol indexer which will soon be serving live Uniswap data. Currently you're saying that users could still use uniswap during that time, but if users can't get the most up to date Uniswap data, Uniswap won't work.
undefined says What can we do to make sure that blocks are still being propagated during those times of peak usage?
undefined says Agreeing with @Vincent | Data Nexus. Both my main and backup node were not getting new blocks due to the feed issue. I'm running a Livepeer Orchestrator/Transcoder which stops working (all ongoing transcoding jobs get cancelled) when the node stops working. I'd also like a solution to stop this from happening in the future.
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs my node is getting CPU spikes, `Head state missing, repairing`  and it get out of sync, what can i do?
undefined says this never happen before the 08/18 sequencer issue
undefined says This is because your node shutdown ungraceful so cause the database crashed, you can graceful shutdown next time: docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
undefined says yes, but the ungraceful shutdown was because of the CPU spike, that causes the machine to halt
undefined says then i shut it down gradefully and start over but it halst againt at the same block
undefined says 
undefined says im using version `v2.0.14-2baa834`
undefined says AWS instance m5a.xlarge
undefined says with plenty of  gp3 volume space at 16000 IOPS
undefined says You should wait it to resume, it will resume the database but need to take some time
undefined says 2 cores might not enough because as geth docs said: It is preferable to use a quad-core (or dual-core hyperthreaded) CPU. Geth is released for a wide range of architectures: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/hardware-requirements
undefined says Can anyone point me to a goood walkthrough/tutorial on going about setting up a Nitro node (specifically AnyTrust) locally?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs so you think that 4 vCPU are not enough?
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs now the node is en a loop of
Aborting state snapshot generation       
Resuming state snapshot generation
undefined says enough
undefined says it's normal behavior
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  , we set up a websocket between our full node and our server. each time the node processes a transaction, it will send an event to our server. But each time we receive an event, we don't know whether there is any event left in the same block. Is there any way for us to:
1) configure the node such that it sends us something to mark the end of a block OR
2) configure the node such that it only sends us an event once it has finished the whole block?
we don't want to wait until we receive an event of the next block to know that the previous block is over.
undefined says i wonder if the mininal hardware requirements here can be altered in the code—https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#minimum-hardware-configuration? i mean if the requirement such as storage is specific to some functions that are resources consuming? if i determinalistically jump there function? maybe the mininal limit can be skipped?
undefined says Can I ask which ws method you connect? You mean rpc method or our feed?
undefined says our full node receives updates from your feed.
but the connection I'm talking about is between our server and our full node
undefined says Yes, i know, I mean what is your ws subscirbe? Because you can subscribe rpc methods using ws, you can also subscribe feed messages using ws.
undefined says which connection are you asking? the one between our server and our full node?
undefined says Hmm, it's too difficulty to do this, and If you want your node to run correctly, skip some method may cause your node down.
undefined says Yes
undefined says we use a localhost websocket to get data from our full node to our server
undefined says Hmm, which data, for example, you can use websocket to get rpc data by calling those methods: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/ , you can also use websocket to get feed data by subscribing port 9642. But I guess what you mean here should be feed data right?
undefined says yes, we already manage to get data in real time from our full node. but we need to know when the feed of a block has ended
undefined says right now, we can only know that a block is over when we receive data of the next block
undefined says Each feed messge is a single block
undefined says If you want to decode the l2Msg, you can see here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/blob/main/packages/batch-tx-handler/src/l1-batch-handler/utils.ts#L60, we also have the docs here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed, so when you got those tx, that block was ended.
undefined says no I think you misunderstood my message
undefined says our node already manages to get data and read your feed
undefined says I'm asking about getting data from our node
undefined says You mean how to know whether a block is ended or not from your node?
undefined says no, from our application server
undefined says which receives data via websocket from our full node
undefined says how does our application server know that it has received all the events related to a block?
undefined says right now, our node sends real-time event updates to our application server
undefined says Ok, becuase I don't know which data type you mean here your application server receives, but I can give you some information here, first, when sequencer feed you message, it will only feed you when a single block is ended, and your node will process that block, so when your server receive that tx, which means the block which includes that tx is already ended
undefined says You don't need to worry you receve tx from a ongoing block
undefined says yes, so our node has processed the data from your sequencer successfully
undefined says our application server subscribes to particular events from our node
undefined says and our node sends these events continuously to our application server
undefined says Yeah, I know what your mean, you don't need to check if that block is ended or not, once you get a new event, which means the block contains that event already ended, the reason is because the node process txs once a block.
undefined says Our minimum block time is only 0.25s, you might think you received a tx but that block hasn't ended.
undefined says So for your questions, the node already doing the (2) condition you are talking about
undefined says thanks Jason for your patience. The fact is that right now from a single block, our application server receives multiple events which come to our server separately
undefined says maybe is there a way to package these events together in 1 package to send to our application server?
undefined says Hmm, I don't think there is such a function to make this.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs could we get a `latest` tag for the arb1 node image or `latest-stable` pretty please 🙂 ? https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/nitro-node/tags
undefined says This would make it easier to update arb1 nodes to the latest version instead of having to go look it up on dockerhub or arb docs website
undefined says Most nodes/docker images have a `latest` tag. Ex. https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/client-go/tags
created a GH issue: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1832
undefined says Will let the team know, thanks
undefined says thank you so much😀 . i have another question. there are five choices for arb1 snapshot—https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html. what's the difference between them? If i want to run a full nitro node in docker, which one i can choose？
undefined says Arbitrum One has upgraded to nitro in 31/08/2022, so if you want to run classic node you need to choose the clssic snapshot (but classic node can't sync the state after 31/08/2022), and for genesis, it is the state on 31/08/2022 which is the time nitro genesis, and pruned/archive are the recent state which you don't need to spend a long time to sync. But for normal fullnode, use nitro-pruned will be ok
undefined says Thank you i feel much clearer,  but which day is pruned snapshot corresponded to ?  😀
undefined says I am not sure, but it should not be too long from now.
undefined says So how long it takes to sync state while initiating a full nitro node from recent prune snapshot?
undefined says It won't take long, it depends on which block height the prune snapshot is, but up to one day I think.
undefined says OK, thank you.
undefined says how many arb do you need for a validator?
undefined says Is there a reward for validators?
undefined says I compiled nitro and launched yesterday.
undefined says not at this time; it's up to the DAO for setting up anything like that
undefined says zero at this time; validators are currently permissioned right now, so although you have a full node there, it's not able to post a challenge to the sequencer yet; we're working to get there: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc
undefined says Thank you very much
undefined says Is this legit? https://github.com/bxdoan/Arbitrum-Full-Node
undefined says is there a simple guide for running a node?
undefined says I downloaded nitro.tar which is like 319gb. How could i use it with docker run --rm -it -v /media/alai/683291e1-4baf-479b-a552-eb24b5a6cc7a/arbitrum-node/official:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url http://192.168.0.29:8555 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*
undefined says --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/snapshot-file.tar" ,  but you should mount the dir to your docker container, and the file path should be your docker container's mounted path.
undefined says Ok it is saying ```extracting downloaded init archive``` which i assume means its doing it's thing and fund the .tar file
undefined says 
undefined says Yup
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs which rpc endpoint suits best following the command in https://github.com/bxdoan/Arbitrum-Full-Node
undefined says I am now using eth.llamarpc.com
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs how does the feeder decide the sequence by which it sends new block data to clients? Is it random?
undefined says The endpoint here you mean should be the l1 endpoint, you can use any l1 rpc provider here, also you can find one here: https://portal.arbitrum.io/?categories=node-provider
undefined says It is poller: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/wsbroadcastserver/clientmanager.go#L218
undefined says Thanks Jason. If I read correctly, the feeder simply iterates from the beginning to the end of the client list? So, the clients which subscribe first (by the time it first started the subscription) will always receive the feeder data first?
undefined says It depends on golang map iterate order, but it should not be fifo order recording to golang docs
undefined says interesting. on the same topic, in case our web socket dies, we will need to rejoin the client map at the end?
undefined says As go docs says: `When iterating over a map with a range loop, the iteration order is not specified and is not guaranteed to be the same from one iteration to the next.` so the order doesn't depend on the sequence you join the map, so back yo your question, yes, it is kinda random
undefined says thanks. is there a method for us to query when exactly our transaction reaches the sequencer?
undefined says Hmm, no, if sequencer send back feed msg which contains your tx, your tx confirmed
undefined says that only happens when our transaction is already contained in a block right?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs nitro's staked validators obtain batch from inbox and check its execution validity, i wonder if validator is a full node except for the stake attribute, is the verify process of a full node same to the validator's?
undefined says yes
undefined says Validator need to compile some part to wasm used for proving (fraud proof), normal node just need to calculate the state.
undefined says OK, i get it! Thank you, but how to calculate the state? now i am trying to run a full node. Is there any api for the batch verify process
undefined says Your node will auto calculate and verify it, no need other settings.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 
does arbitrum nitro node during startup create the go-etherum block-chain , probably connects to existing chain with same chainId
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/2baa83488695ed155fe0c804e5dda528bb2c3ae7/cmd/nitro/init.go#L408
did I get it right?
undefined says Any idea why i'm getting ```nitro  | ERROR[08-29|19:33:10.264] shut down due to fatal error             err="error starting node: error starting geth stack: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:8549: bind: address already in use"
``` I tried the default port but got the same error, even though nothing was running when i used ```sudo lsof -i :8549```
undefined says Seems like an obvious error but i'm clearly not using it when i check lsof or even ```sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8549```
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs any way for us to edit GETH so that it will log the time stamp when our full node receives the new block data from the feeder?
undefined says Hmm, I thought we already have this type log, each time your node sync a new block it will have a log like created block
undefined says there are 2 timestamps that we want to log:
1. the time when our full node receives the data from the feeder
2. the time when our full node finishes processing the new block
undefined says Also, does the processing speed of a new block depend on CPU or GPU?
undefined says If you should specific the l1 rpc, your l2 chain id and correct state database, then it shouldn't. For examples, if you created 2 orbit chain on the same l2 (such as arb1), and you give them the same chainid, it depends on which state database your node uses,  it won't randomly connect, it dpends on the source you provide (l1 rpc, l2 chainid, state database). (ps: l1 refers to l2 and l2 refers to l3 for orbit layer3 network)
undefined says full node will auto verify state of block or batch? since batch is the unit posted onto l1 calldata
undefined says Block process will take super little time (much less than one second), so those 2 steps won't have a different timestamp, and your node will only send out rpc info once your block confirmed. Process new blocks depend on your cpu, no need gpu
undefined says If your node is honest and connect to an honnest l1 rpc provider, you don't need to worry it will execute to a wrong state as evm is single-threading, same inputs will only get one same output. So if your node honestly read l1 inbox, and you don't change any codes to your node, you will get the only one correct result. For verify, I mean your node will verify the feed from sequencer and the l1 record later to make sure your message from sequencer is right.
undefined says Can you check docker if you are running other container may use this port?
undefined says But if you want to have those 2 logs, you only need to add the first as the second we already have: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/executionengine.go#L603, the first you can add here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/broadcastclient/broadcastclient.go#L376
undefined says that's super helpful Jason! Thank you. By the way, in the current state, full nodes don't help the network at all right? everything is already handled by the sequencer and feeder
undefined says Fullnode can provide rpc service to others, and ethereum network's fullnodes also only have this function, it is validator to maintenance the consensus on l1.
undefined says another question, right now, I see the feeder sends both compressed and uncompressed block data. Which one should we choose? Let's say if we want to receive the feed data earliest?
undefined says It should have no differences
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says thank you, i try to run a full node and it now outputs:
is this a successful startup?
undefined says Yes
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labsok, how to query the full node for recent batch
undefined says Query the recent batch doesn't need your fullnode, you can query l1 sequencer inbox: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c479675ad559dc151f6ec7ed3fbf8cee79582b6 for batch adding tx, and you can decode those batch using this script: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/blob/main/packages/batch-tx-handler/README.md#l1-batch-handler . If you mean you want to query your node for whether a block included on l1 or not, you can use eth_getBlockByNumber with tag finalize, it will return a latest l2 block whose batch already finalize on l1.
undefined says sorry, i stiil doubt about this, you mean that my full node will read batch from l1  inbox and execute it to verify the new state's validity? just as validator do?
undefined says Your node will calculate the state itself, your node won't receive any state.
undefined says When your node is syncing, it will read l1 state directly and calculate the state, once your node sync to the latest block, it will listen to sequencer for feed messages, and will check the feed message later when that message sent to l1 inbox. Feed message doesn't contain any state but only tx and their order, here is the sequencer feed message's structure: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs theoretically, if we send transactions to https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc and https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/rpc. which one will be recorded first by the sequencer?
undefined says We can't make any promise which one is faster
undefined says but theoretically?
undefined says Sorry, we can't provide any information for this.
undefined says sure. thanks!
undefined says no problem
undefined says thank you, i restart my node and it repeat:

what's wrong?
undefined says You need wait sometime to let it resume, this is because your node stopped ungraceful, next time you can use `docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)` to shutdown.
undefined says OK, thank you
undefined says 
undefined says This log message has never appeared when running our full nodes and defensive validator, today(~ 2 hours ago) it started spamming these log messages across all nodes and our defensive validator. Can anyone provide insight into what these mean and if there is a problem?
```{"blocks":1,"elapsed":"136.699µs","lvl":"info","msg":"Unindexed transactions","t":"2023-08-30T17:27:31.296017155Z","tail":220203,"txs":1}
{"blocks":1,"elapsed":"124.165µs","lvl":"info","msg":"Unindexed transactions","t":"2023-08-30T17:27:31.419582306Z","tail":220204,"txs":1}```
undefined says here you say  full node will check feed message once message are sent to l1 inbox, how full node check? it will execute these txs contained in message again by order?
undefined says another question, if i query my node for block l1 inclusion using curl command,  for example:
curl  http://localhost:8547 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["xxx", true],"id":67}


 how to add the tag finalize?  api eth_getBlockByNumber seems need one parameter "blockNumber"
undefined says The first parameter can be number or the string "earliest", "latest" or "pending"
undefined says No need to execute again, just check if the tx and order are same to feed message
undefined says Or you can set --node.feed.input.url to "" so you will not receive msg from sequencer, your node will only subscribe to l1 inbox
undefined says So only validator will execute txs again to verify the stf correctness? if  want to do this, is the only way to run a validator? full node seems not provide this function.
undefined says Hmm, why you need to execute again, because if you know the same input, only one correct result there. What validator verify is to check whether their state is same to l1 rblock or not. Also your node will run watchtower mode validator by default, it will also do this process to check if the l1 rblock is same to their local state or not, if not, will immediately log an error, but this doesn't mean your state is incorrect, it might be the l1 rblock is incorrect and need others to challenge
undefined says As I said because evm is single-threading, so if you have the correct inputs, and you execute it correctly, there will be only one result, so verifying the input or the result (state) is the same effect
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs is this line the one our full node starts processing the block data received from the feeder?
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/executionengine.go#L578
undefined says It's here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/executionengine.go#L521
undefined says nice. this's my first time editting geth haha. hope that nothing goes wrong.
undefined says so ideally, we can put a log right after line 521 to log the time when our node finishes processing a new block?
undefined says how about logging the time when our node receives the data from the feeder? where should we put that line?
undefined says I think you don't need to log when a block finish processing, because this line has the same effect: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/executionengine.go#L603
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/broadcastclient/broadcastclient.go#L376
undefined says Thanks Jason. If I'm not mistaken, this line will be run every second to check the latest block in our full node only?
undefined says Each time when block process finish, it will execute this log
undefined says 
undefined says Couple of days ago I started seeing the unindexed transaction messages on my full node logs. Three or four of them between each 'created block' message. I've been running the node for several weeks without issue. Any idea what may be the problem? Is it a problem?

```INFO [08-31|04:26:09.734] created block                            l2Block=126,586,542 l2BlockHash=399f9d..7cd8b2

```
undefined says It's not an error, so no need to worry
undefined says from a pure performance perspective (sending tx, and listening specific logs emitted from couple of contracts) is running your own arbitrum node is worth it compared to paying to a node provider alchemy, quicknode et al?
undefined says OK,  doc says full node will run in Watchtower mode, like this ?

 what's meaning of parameter "node". i notice it is  incremented by one for each assertion
and what's meaning of "examining existing potential successors"
undefined says I'm seeing the same "Unindexed transactions" on all of my full nodes, but not on my archive node... @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  any idea what thats about?  All of them have the same tail= number, so they're in sync about the unindexed txns..  Never seen that error before...
undefined says I've checked and nothing else is running. This is the logs from docker
undefined says It is not errors, no need to worry, cc @impact @lemon819
undefined says yeah it's not errors, i mean what's meaning of "found corect assertion", is this  full node's check for validator assertions?
undefined says I have a game where items are NFTs registered on Arbitrum Nova. Our backend server needs to get all NFTs owned by players.
Running an Arbitrum Full Node is what I need ? Anything specific to Nova ? Or should I just follow this tutorial ?
https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node

Thanks in advance
undefined says Yes, your node will check that
undefined says Just follow the tutorial and change l2 chainid to 42170 the you will successfully run a nova fullnode.
undefined says Thanks. Hardware requirements are the same as for a Arb One Fullnode ?
undefined says Also it says SSD, I don't imagine we need low latency, and a RAID50 of fast SAS HDD would be enough ?
undefined says The same, but nova doesn't need as much disk space as arb1.
undefined says You should prepare SSD for better, but if you don't need low latency, a fast SAS HDD should work.
undefined says How do you go about deploying a smart contract to nitro-testnode? or do you need to setup a full node in order to test this?
undefined says how to upgrade running arbitrum node to latest version?
undefined says Can someone also tell me can the nitro-testnode run a Nova/AnyTrust instance ?
undefined says i have  problem with my node setup.
undefined says i extracted snapshot as usual.
I also notice there is a new folder once i launch nitro (l2chaindata/ancient/chain)
this is my tree.
undefined says 
undefined says i installed several time the arbitrum node with same setup. no idea why this time it's not working XD

also, on my older node, i don't have that extra chain folder
undefined says That's great to hear. Thanks Jason
undefined says This happened after an unclean shutdown, power tripped (my fault)
Haven’t seen these logs before,
undefined says Is this anything to worry about, what is it exactly
undefined says These are normal, but I dont think we've been told exactly what is going on with these messages.
undefined says When attempting to deploy a smart contract to the nitro-testnode docker l2 using the following hardhat config:
```
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.7",
  networks: {
    localhost: {
        url: 'http://localhost:8545'
    },
    localnitrol2: {
        // chainId: 412346,
        url: 'http://localhost:8547',
        accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
        // timeout: 0,
        network_id: '*',
        gasPrice: 0
    }
  }
};
```
I get the following timeout error - I've tried toupdate node.js and increase the timeout but still same error
```
Error deploying contract: HeadersTimeoutError: Headers Timeout Error

The same deployment script deploys to the public l2 RPC I have on QuickNode so its only my local docker nitro node that is having issues
undefined says anyone ?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1147141001316663356
undefined says see : https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node#default-endpoints-and-addresses for info on prefunded addresses with ETH
undefined says when you run the node, you'll have that ETH
undefined says at those addresses with those private keys; use those addresses to make standard JSON-RPC calls or use Hardhat / Foundry to assist
undefined says yes, that's a flag; `--node.data-availability.enable ` when running the node locally in dev mode: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/command-line-options#nitro-node-flags
follow directions at https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart#step-7-configure-keyset-anytrust-chains-only for AnyTrust Orbit chain
undefined says you need to pass the `--init.url` flag the first time you run a node and let it sync for quite a while, sometimes can take a day or more to sync depending on network speed: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#required-artifacts
undefined says can you make a basic `eth_blockNumber` call?
undefined says just a read only op like that?
undefined says what i usually do is running with --init.url to let nitro create the folder tree, then after a few minutes i stop it,  paste untared snapshot on the data folder, then restart without init.url.
 I never had issue with this process. is there something changed with nitro2.0.14 about that ?
undefined says no need to manually do that, just do: --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/snapshot-file.tar"
undefined says thanks, works perfectly.
undefined says Thanks for the response - so what would be the command to run using the test-node. bash script to get a DAS running too - ./test-node.bash --node.data-availability.enable` doesn;t work
undefined says Thanks for the insight! Any idea what these unindexed transactions are and why they seemingly started fairly recently? Just curious.
undefined says This is because we default txlookup on arb to 126230400, and for what is unindexing tx and why it is related to txlookup, you can see: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0 (it is under `Transaction unindexing` subtitle)
undefined says Do I need to follow `how-tos/running-an-archive-node` guide to run a node that can provide traces?
undefined says Yeap
undefined says I see, so I can't just run only a Nitro node with `--node.caching.archive` and expect to get recent traces, right?
undefined says Also, do I need to use `nitro-archive.tar` snapshot to run archive node, or can I start with `nitro-pruned.tar` and let is sync from there?
undefined says Yeah, it depends on the point from which you want to start having traces. If you want to have them from now on, you can start with nitro-pruned. Keep in mind that you won't be able to trace older blocks if you do that though.

Similarly, if you are currently running a full node and you add the "archive" flag, it will start saving the status from that point on, so you'll be able to trace blocks from that point, but not older blocks.
undefined says I see, so to get traces for Nitro period I only need full node with archive parameter and archive snapshot, but if I want pre-nitro traces I also need classic node
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs we've set up the time log and see a few interesting things. For example at this block 127859888, our full node took 25 seconds to process the block. Anything special about this block? Normally, our node takes about 10ms to complete processing a new block.
undefined says I don't think there is any issue of that block, probably your server stuck or something
undefined says i'm setting up a nitro node (want to learn), running nitro from cmd folder. one of the parameters for it is the rpc address of the sequencer. i should run another go program for the sequencer. but is it one of the cmd go programs? or where is the sequencer code?

what am i missing here?
undefined says you use another instance of nitro, but pass the flag: `--node.type=sequencer`
undefined says if you're trying to create your own local sequencer. otherwise, just run nitro as regular and it will run in validator mode. for that the rpc url would depend on what chain you want to connect to: Arb One, Nova or a testnet
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers#rpc-endpoints
undefined says actually trying to run my own ETH network and nitro. to understand the flow...
so I have to setup another nitro node and then to point to that one ?   (nitro node is an actual sequencer node)
undefined says Run `./nitro-testnode/test-node.bash --init` to setup a local devnet
undefined says yes, you can run it in sequencer mode; but if you're just trying to understand it, I'd recommend running a local dev node: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/local-dev-node

it will set up a sequencer and a validator, deploy all the contracts etc
undefined says yep
undefined says where do these flags get passed into if using the testnode repo? I've update the config.ts file with:
undefined says which I can see gets called from the script via:
```
    echo == Writing configs
    docker-compose run scripts write-config
```
undefined says Then after running ` ./test-node.bash --init --dev --blockscout` no DAS is running
undefined says how do i run arbitrum nova node ? i already run arbitrum one, but can't find docs for nova
undefined says If you're already running an arbitrum one node, the only difference is you pass the nova chain idea instead of the arbitrum one chain id when you boot the node. You can get the chainid from https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers#rpc-endpoints
undefined says The local test node setup doesn't have support for launching a local anytrust chain. Can you explain more what your goal is here? I haven't seen that requested before
undefined says what I've been trying to do is setup a  full L2 Nova node with DAS running locally and be able to run a few smart contracts as tests to access metrics and costs.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs what are the ways we can do to help our node processing incoming blocks faster? On average, it takes us about 10ms but for blocks that have lots of transactions, our node usually takes about 60ms. However, our CPU and RAM still have lots of free space.
undefined says thanks a lot
undefined says There's a lot of single threaded logic in the core state transition function so you might be bumping up against that. Generally if you're not saturating CPU or memory, the other area you can increase speed is by getting a faster processor and/or faster memory
undefined says ultimately a smart contract will use the same amount of EVM gas regardless of what mode the node is running in; the main difference between AnyTrust costs and Rollup costs are in the L1 calldata savings. A local node is just going to use fixed values for L1 gas price and L2 gas price, and it's not going to be reflective of production gas prices. But generally a Nova transaction is going to cost 1/10th of a One tx (reflected by the minimum base fee on each chain). Also AnyTrust L1 calldata size is fixed. More info can be found here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas#where-do-we-get-all-this-information-from
undefined says My node logs are spamming warnings
```
error reading inbox                      err="reorging of sequencer batch number 216674 via delayed messages reorg to count 879352 disabled in this instance"
```
What's going on, andd how can I solve it?
undefined says Can you provide the docker run command you're using and a few more lines of logs?
Also, "error reading inbox" might indicate a problem with your L1 node, verify that it is available, in sync, and running correctly.
undefined says ```

```
undefined says I will verify l1 node, thanks for info
undefined says https://pastebin.com/vn6gibDq logs
undefined says What version of the node are you using? Those parameters seem to be from a non-released version (later than 2.0.14)
undefined says It is recommended to use the latest released version => v2.0.14-2baa834
undefined says As per the error itself, the node seems to be stuck on a loop trying to get to a good state. I see there was an unclean shutdown so it might be that your db got corrupted. Your L1 node might have some issues too.

But in any case, as I mentioned before, you should run the latest released version to make sure you don't run into unexpected issues.
undefined says init.prune
undefined says Dear admin, please advise what are the minimum coin requirements if we wish to participate as validator noder in Arbitrum?
undefined says Dear admin, I  have a node running arbitrum one. And my project need FULL NODE 
My node disk is more than 5.3TB now
How can i prune data or do something, disk is too big
undefined says You can use `--init.prune <Your node type>` to prune your node, usually it is full or validator
undefined says It needs whitelist now, but we just public bold, a permissionless version of validator, but it hasn't deployed to our mainnet yet: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf
undefined says Thanks for updates, any minimum coin requirements?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says For now it is 1 ethers.
undefined says You can query it by calling baseSatke: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35#readProxyContract
undefined says Thank you. can you give me more document or example about it ?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#pruning
undefined says Thank you for your help
undefined says how to run full node without docker? The file link in FAQ is deleted. https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq#how-do-i-run-a-node-locally-for-development
undefined says After go build nitro, I cannot run nitro, the cmd flag l1.url and l2.chain-id is not supported.
undefined says Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --l1.url
undefined says you mean we can apply concurrency to the core state transition function? Can you please point me to the function? My CPU usage is only about 5% my memory is half available most of the time.
undefined says which init data should I use when run full node, pruned or archived?
undefined says If you don't need archived data, just use pruned
undefined says OK
undefined says You can see those command here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/command-line-options , it has details which type of args you need to apply
undefined says OK, thanks
undefined says Your cpu and memory usage is not high mean there are not so many tasks run at the same time, you can still higher the speed by using a faster cpu or memory.
undefined says thanks. I'm looking at concurrency first. Do you have any thoughts on this?
undefined says For concurrency, I would defer to @Harry | Offchain Labs
undefined says thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs . Look forward to your answer then @Harry | Offchain Labs
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  i wonder if there parameters https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#required-parameterare are created during the image build stage using --build-arg, since docker run command defaultly haven't equip this parameters.
undefined says No, you must specify those 2 command when start the docker container.
undefined says I mean why nitro image can use there parameters such as l1.url, l2.chain-id, while other image not
undefined says That parameters will be used when you run the entrypoint command, all images can do this.
undefined says you mean ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile?
undefined says Yup, those parameter will be used when run the entrypoint.
undefined says So how is this image built, to just execute docker build in the nitro directory ?
undefined says No, we have instructions here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally
undefined says Is this the doc for nitro image build?
undefined says Yes, it will build docker image here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Makefile#L160
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Wow, I see it, thank you so much👍
undefined says I'm looking for some unlimited RPC Endpoint addresses!
If you are running a node, can you give me the RPC address?
undefined says I will try, thanks!
undefined says You can find some 3rd party endpoints here: https://portal.arbitrum.io/?chains=arbitrum-one&categories=node-provider
undefined says my node is always `traversing trie database` about 2h40m, is this normal?
undefined says 
undefined says The state transition function itself can't run in multiple threads, it has to be single threaded so that it's deterministic running the EVM
undefined says We you pruning your DB? If so it's likely still pruning
undefined says After switching to using `v2.0.14` branch, as well as clearing database, I'm still getting this issue, so I want to ask:
Do I need a GETH ethereum node to run nitro node? Our current ETh node is Erigon
undefined says Erigon should be supported. It seems like maybe it's pruning old receipts or doesn't have those fully synced maybe?
undefined says still pruning, what should I do？
undefined says removed init.prune=full, it's normal now...
undefined says prune always take a lot of time, it is normal. Yes, you can also cancel prune.
undefined says `created block` is really slow, and cpu utilization has always been low. How can I accelerate this process? My machine is aws 4c-16G
undefined says It will also depend on your l1 rpc because your node will read l1 to get data
undefined says Oh? Do I need a full archive ETH node too?
undefined says No need archive l1 node, is your l1 node finish syncing and works fine? If so, might be someting wrong with your l2 node state db which cause your node need to reorg delayed msg, you can set `--node.inbox-reader.hard-reorg=true` to enable the reorg.
undefined says Or if you don't want to reorg, you can download a recent snapshot to sync again: https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html
undefined says hay @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs how do we know the actual block time of a block? Right now, a second normally has 4 blocks which have the same time stamp.
undefined says I don't think we have a more detail information than that timestamp which can feed out.
undefined says hmm why doesn't the sequencer add an L2 timestamp in ms?
undefined says now we can only measure block times in seconds so many blocks have the same time stamps
undefined says no way we can know the precise time stamp that the sequencer produces these blocks?
undefined says No, we don't have that in feed message. May I ask any reason why you need this? What kinda project you are trying to build?
undefined says My snapshot is ~1 week old, and I have deleted old DB and restarted from the snapshot just yesterday
undefined says I will try this, thanks!
undefined says l1 node is synced and running fine, but I'm currently syncing a second node, this time GETH, will try it too if rorg won't help
undefined says I got this error after running a nitro node with reorg enabled
```
INFO [09-12|14:04:44.267] backwards reorg of delayed messages      from=959,809 to=879,352

```
undefined says You can still set `--node.transaction-streamer.max-reorg-resequence-depth int  (maximum number of messages to attempt to resequence on reorg (0 = never resequence, -1 = always resequence) (default 1024))` to set that depth but I recommand you to re-sync since re-sync might be faster.
undefined says After nodde restart it's not printing that anymore
undefined says 
undefined says now it's https://pastebin.com/8DDw3CK8
undefined says WIll see in 4 hours if it's done
undefined says Does follower node supports fast catchup?
undefined says Currently only full sync is supported. The fastest method to get a node synced is to start from an existing synced database by using `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar"`. We're working on developing a fast syncing mode that will be make it easier and fast to start runnign a nod, but that's still some way out
undefined says We're building a DEX real-time analytics dashboard. Our clients are traders and funds so they expect our feed to be as quick as possible. We want to know the real block time to check if there's any significant latency between the time the block is produced and the time we receive the block feed.
undefined says as the block doesn't have the actual block time, we don't know if our feed is delayed
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  i build nitro locally, and some errors occur like this:
could somebody help with this issue?
undefined says Are you following the instructions from https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally? If not you should check that out. Looks like you need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive --force`
undefined says Sorry there's no solution for this planned. The only timestamp is the one on the block and ethereum requires that it be in seconds or it would break a ton of tooling compatibility
undefined says so what's the best way for us to measure the latency between our node and the feeder?
undefined says and talking about concurrency, what are the opportunities for us to process a new block faster, besides having faster CPU and memory? @Harry | Offchain Labs ?
undefined says Faster CPU, memory, and disk are the only things you can do to potentially increase sync speed most likely, and I don't think there's much you can do for subsecond measurement on the feed currently other than recording when a block is received by your node
undefined says Thanks Harry. But measuring the time we receive a block doesn't mean much when we don't know when it is produced?
undefined says I want to run the Validator. Could you tell me how many Tokens are require and what is the Token name. Help me on this side. Thanks
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs what's the minimum specs to run a feed relay?
undefined says I mean all you can do is look at the difference between the timestamp on the block and the time that you receive it. There's nothing more accurate than that
undefined says There's no recommended minimum specs for the relay, but it has quite minimal resource requirements
undefined says thanks Harry. I really like arbitrum. hopefully you can consider adding a layer2 timestamp on blocks in the future.
undefined says What is it that you need subsecond timing on blocks for?
undefined says here
undefined says Ah sorry had forgotten your original message. Yeah I don't think there's any great solutions to that currently to detect latency under 1 second. I'll let you know if something changes here. I don't think modifying the block header's timestamp would be possible because the header format is standard and assumed by a lot of tooling to be a unix timestamp, but potentially we could do something like include the more precise timestamp in the feed

One way you might be able to get some more confidence in the latency would be just looking at the difference between timestamp you get a block at and timestamp on the block. Blocks for arbitrum one are produced at a variable rate depending on the rate of transactions with at most 1 block per .25 seconds, but on arbitrum one there's enough traffic that it's almost a full 4 blocks/second. I think you should be able to roughly guess your latency by just looking at how many blocks arrive in the same second as you see on the timestamp. That can at least get you to estimating the latency to the nearest 250ms vs to the nearest second
undefined says yes we're already doing that.
undefined says Ah nice
undefined says So basically you're trying to tell even more finegrain than that? Yeah no good solution for now unfortunately
undefined says we're assuming that on average there are 4 blocks in a second. This works most of the time except for cases where there are more than 4 blocks in a second or for some reason, your sequencer takes less than 250ms to produce the next block
undefined says yeah but I think an easy fix is to include the time stamp in the feeder data
undefined says Currently running validators is permissioned by the Arbitrum DAO so in order to stake you'd need to get approved first. Staking is done in Eth and there's a 1 Eth stake requirement. However a protocol called BOLD is currently under development which will allow permissionless staking
undefined says My node stopped. I went to my VPS and tried to rerun it like this:
I am listening to ports 8548 and 9642 with websocket. But if I run this command:
`docker run -d -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/... --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=9642 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*`
I still cannot access my node. There is the error:

What to do here?
undefined says Thanks , It is also same for Testnet
undefined says Can you tell me tokens in ARB not in ETH
undefined says Yes it's the same for testnet and validators stake in ETH not ARB
undefined says Looks like you set `--ws.port` twice which is weird along with some other duplicated ws args. I'm not sure if the first or the second takes precedence which could be an issue. You should see if connecting over RPC works and also check whether there are any errors in the logs of your node
undefined says do you need to sync a full node from the genesis snapshot? I am not seeing a full node snapshot, unless pruned actually means full which is a bit confusing
undefined says When erigon?
undefined says Will we able to run a testnet node for Stylus @Samuel | Arbitrum ?
undefined says Kindly refer to this https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1146789176939909251/1150219336850616340

undefined says pruned snapshot is pruned full node snapshot, the snapshot is defaut fullnode type unless it has archive mentioned.
undefined says You state db is crashed, it will resume but needs to take sometime. Next time you shutdowm your node, you can use `docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)` to gracefully shut down,
undefined says Thank you @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs for the reply.
undefined says @Harry | Offchain Labs i observe there are three images built in Makefile(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Makefile#L161) while executing command(make docker), but which one is the  image-offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 used here-https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#required-artifacts
undefined says The second one: nitro-node, but to build a v2.0.14 image, you need to make sure you checkout to v2.0.14 in nitro root.
undefined says Ok, i use the image "nitro-node" built from command "make docker" to start a container, why it outputs:
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  i firstly execute: docker run nitro-node:latest, it outputs:

this image is built by Makefile in the nitro master branch. 
then i execute "docker run offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834", it outputs:
[pic]db26829324db185301932162c6e64282[/pic]
 
i wonder if images from different branches will specify L1 URL and chainid with different parameters
undefined says They are different, for the version after v2.0.14, it is  `--parent-chain.connection.url` and --chain.id, you can run `--help` yto get those information
undefined says OK, what is the concrete command of --help?
undefined says i am a little confused
undefined says `docker run --rm -it  -v /YourDirLoction:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 -p 0.0.0.0:6070:6070 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 nitro-node:latest --help`
undefined says It will show all commands you can use
undefined says same here, 504
undefined says Thank you so much, i have been stucked by this question for several days, now my image can run properly.
undefined says Nice to hear that
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  Can you help me to prune data in my full node
I try to add command -- init.prune
But i got error:
```
Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --init.prune
Version: v2.0.9-51f9452, time: 2022-12-09T13:54:56-06:00
Sample usage: /usr/local/bin/nitro --help
```
Can you give me example command ?
I use my docker-compose
undefined says You need upgrade your node to v2.0.14-2baa834
undefined says ah. ok thank you
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs node throws this error:  failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 504" any ideas?
undefined says @jif.micro the same here
undefined says same， but not all node
undefined says Sequencer feed seems to have connectivity issues here as well.
undefined says same problem, how to fix it?
undefined says Is there a way to move off from the official sequencer feed endpoint? There's an article how to run your own feed relay, but it depends on connecting to official one still - I suppose Arbitrum nodes don't do P2P at all?
undefined says I haven't dived deep in the inner workings of the node architecture & infrastructure yet, but given that the sequencer endpoint has some connectivity issues I need to start looking from somewhere
undefined says According to my monitoring, Hetzner node in Finland seems to have connectivity issues, while Hetzner node in Germany (Nuremberg) works perfectly.
undefined says Ok and how should it look like, if I want to access port 8548 and 9642?
undefined says You can't have websockets running on multiple ports. Not sure why you'd need that?
undefined says There was an issue with one of the relays in the fleet that serves the feed interface earlier this morning that was resolved this morning and mitigations have been deployed to avoid this sort of issue happening again
undefined says guys, anyone know dose it fix?
undefined says Are you still experiencing the error currently? There was an issue earlier, but it should have been resolved many hours ago
undefined says got it, it seems normal, Thanks
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Because I want to listen to the sequencer feed and the normal feed. 
It worked a week ago, but maybe my VPS provider changed something… And I don’t know the command I used before anymore 🙄
undefined says hey guys 
do u have docker-compose.yml?
undefined says I rebooted my node and it came back up with. Not sure why...
undefined says I'm guessing your node hasn't been gracefully shutdown and has caused the database to crash, you can restart it and wait until it can successfully sync the chain.
(using `docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)` to stop the node before pruning it could potentially prevent this issue I guess)
undefined says So it looks like an unrecoverable state? Full resync from snapshot? 😦
undefined says I already had a termination grace period set to 600, not sure why there would have been an ungraceful shutdown
undefined says I think so, another idea is that you could run into this issue (https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1153765308805423194) if you try to prune a node that hasn't fully synced
undefined says Has anyone had this error? if someone could help  me it would be awesome, i'm trying to deploy a goerly node 🙂
undefined says What parameters are you using to initiate your node?
( Also, you should hide your Alchemy endpoint from the screenshot 🙂 )
undefined says It's just for test, i'll create another np
undefined says 
undefined says i have nitro-pruned.tar inside /home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says "user" is a directory that i created, "arbitrum" is the default of Ubuntu
undefined says containerPath must be /home/user/.arbitrum .
And your "localPath" should allow docker to write on it (check permissions).
If all that is good, your snapshot file should be in /usr/local/arbitrum/nitro-pruned.tar in your local machine ( so docker can find it in the mounted /home/user/.arbitrum/nitro-pruned.tar )
undefined says You have more info here about the mount point => https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#putting-it-all-together
undefined says docker-compose.yml must be in the same folder with nitro-pruned.tar right? (/usr/local/arbitrum in this case; the localPath)

docker will mount the file in /home/user/.arbitrum but at the moment of executing the "docker compose up" this directory must be empty?
undefined says I think the location of docker-compose is independent of what docker will use as a mount point. Are you getting another error?
undefined says Why I am getting this error if I try to connect to port 9642 on my `node?`
`node:events:491`
      `throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event`
     ` ^`

Thank you guys
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs : I am having issues buidling and deployment nitro as an orbit subnet. What is the best way to share my issues? Google doc? Github issues?
undefined says Hey, is it a global problemn with sequencer feed? I cannot reach my sequencer feed via websocket...
undefined says I am running as follows and it consistently seems to hit the same fail case:
```
  /usr/local/bin/nitro \
  --init.url 'https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar' \
  --init.download-path /data/tmp \
  --persistent.chain /data \
  --init.prune full \
  --auth.jwtsecret /jwt.hex \
  --http.addr 0.0.0.0 \
  --http.port 8547 \
  --http.api eth,net,web3,debug,txpool,arb \
  --http.vhosts '*' \
  --http.corsdomain '*' \
  --ws.addr 0.0.0.0 \
  --ws.port 8548 \
  --ws.api eth,net,web3,debug,txpool,arb \
  --ws.origins '*' \
  --l1.url $L1_RPC_ENDPOINT \
  --l2.chain-id 42161 \
  --node.staker.enable='false' \
  --node.tx-lookup-limit 0 &
```
undefined says should I just omit `init.prune`?
undefined says i am wanting to run a full node (ability to query all block/txs, no trace state needed a-la archive) which is why I set the flag, but something doesn't seem happy
undefined says If you find some bugs, you can open an issue, or you can also post your issue here
undefined says How do you reach your feed, do you run your own feed like this: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-feed-relay ?
undefined says Remove init.prune and restart your node, when your node recover the state db, then graceful shutdown (docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)) your node, and then you can prune
undefined says Ahh since Sep 18, that fits my connection problems thanks. So I have to rerun my node as described and add the command for the feed relay right?
undefined says If you just run one node, you don't need to run a feed relay, your node will subscribe sequencer feed automatically. The feed relay is used for those who run multi nodes and they don't need all their node to subscribe the sequencer but just the relay to reduce network cost.
undefined says But my node is running and I cannot connect to feed relay on port 9642
undefined says Hello! I made the changes, ran "docker compose up" and it got frozen at the "extracting the downloaded init file" step, is this normal? How long does it usually take? I think one of the reasons why it may take time is that I assigned 4gb ram to the virtual machine when creating it...
undefined says 4Gb is certainly low for running the node => https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#minimum-hardware-configuration

Also, if you're mounting /home/user/.arbitrum to /usr/local/arbitrum, make sure that docker can write in that local folder, and you could try running docker-compose from a different folder (I'm not 100% sure, but there could be potential issues with mounting a volume to a folder where you're executing an instruction).

In any case, it might be worth to run the command of the documentation first, to rule out potential issues with your setup (at least to the point where it begins syncing)  => https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#putting-it-all-together

And you can work your way up to the docker-compose setup later.
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs  my node froze today at 02:40:59 UTC, was the arbitrum chain over heavy load at that time? does any node operator had the same issue?
```
Sep 21 02:40:59 : INFO [09-21|02:40:59.731] created block                            l2Block=133,044,171 l2BlockHash=e0ea0a..b9c866

```

it was stuck for 20 minutes and then suddenly restarted, Im running the node with docker, my instance had a CPU spike at that time, after a lot of `unindexed transactions` logged by the node
undefined says my nitro node is continuously logging this:
undefined says Hey, we haven't received any reports about that. What resources have you allocated for your node? Also, do you have any ERROR or WARN logs from nitro during that time?
undefined says already working, the issue was that i wasn't executing the command of docker run .... (insted using that before i used docker compose up), but if now i use docker compose up, everything works fine, thanks jose!!
undefined says I am using the provided docker-compose file in the orbit-setup-script repo.
undefined says Errors:
undefined says Are you running an orbit chain? Or a nitro node for ArbOne or Nova?
Your errors might suggest a problem with the RPC for the underlying chain (if you're running an L2 node, your RPC for the L1 node; if you're running an Orbit chain, your RPC for the L2 node)
undefined says I'm running an orbit chain that I deployed.
undefined says No problem! Glad it worked 💪
undefined says I generated the json config files using the orbit deployment portal.
undefined says Are you settling to ArbGoerli or ArbSepolia? And did you run all steps of the quickstart? (including the orbit-setup-script?)
undefined says I followed the instructions here and using Goerli.
undefined says https://orbit.arbitrum.io/
undefined says in my nodeConfig.json:

  "parent-chain": {
    "connection": {
      "url": "https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"
    }
  },
undefined says After deploying the contracts on ArbGoerli, you'd have to continue from this step => https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart#step-9-clone-the-setup-script-repository-and-add-your-configuration-files
undefined says I did complete steps 9, 10
undefined says Did you also run the script on step 11? (You need to fund the batch poster and the staker for the chain to be fully functional)
https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart#step-11-finish-setting-up-your-chain
undefined says here are my funding transactions
undefined says Are you using the latest version of the orbit-setup-script repo? We added a few changes last week iirc.
undefined says what is the latest version commit?
undefined says I had to make changes to docker-compose.yaml to open up ports. is it better to push these changes upstream?
undefined says Just the current main branch. Changes in docker-compose.yaml shouldn't be necessary, but could point at the issue you are having. What changes did you make?
undefined says These changes are necessary to acceess the services remotely:

      PORT: 4000
    ports:
      - "0.0.0.0:4000:4000"
    expose:
      - "4000"
undefined says Also have to add a nitro build service:

  nitro_build:
    build: ../origin-nitro/
    image: nitro
    container_name: nitro_builder
undefined says I am seeing issues with my nodes in APAC connecting to the feed. Is anyone else seeing issues?
undefined says `failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 504"`
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says You shouldn't need to build nitro. And docker-compose already has the necessary nitro image configured 🤔 

Are you running your chain on local? Does the regular flow + script work (without any modifications)?

Trying to rule out some basic issues.
undefined says I am runnign a custom fork of nitro because I'm adding a custom pre-compile contract.
undefined says i am running the node in a VM.
undefined says I have same issue.... 
```
WARN [09-21|16:31:43.513] failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 504"
```
undefined says Alright, that's something different. I would try to make it work first inside your VM (without the custom precompile), and then add the custom precompile, so you know in what step is your chain not working.
For the errors you mentioned, I'd say there might be some networking issues going on with your VM, but having a custom nitro image can also make things harder to debug.
Can you make a regular orbit chain work inside a VM?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Any help on our front?
undefined says I haven't seen any report about it, but let me ask internally. cc: @RyanWang
undefined says I have same issue 😦
undefined says Any update? The issue still exists.😢
undefined says I had to get my node an new Public IP address and that fixed it. So def some really bad nginx/Lb rules I think
undefined says Maybe the LB has some rule that made my node always connect to the bad sequencer. But for some reason, I can't change my public ip. 🥲
undefined says Does running this:
`docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url https://l1-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=<L2ChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*`
upgrades my node? Or do I have to upgrade separately and then run it?
and is `--l1.url https://l1-node:8545` correct or do I have to add an URL?
And do I also have to add `--ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*` for port 8548?
undefined says I just downloaded the snapshot and I started my node now, but it looks like it's hanging on:
`Reloading chain to the last checkpoint saved

undefined says is this expected and how long should it take for it to sync from the snapshot?
undefined says Are you running classic node? The classic node needs sometime to init, so it is normal
undefined says No, you need to use docker pull to get the latest version, our latest stable version is offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834
undefined says always abort/resume state snapshot generation, why?
undefined says the resp of `eth_syncing` is `{

    "id": 336,
    "result": {
        "batchMetadataError": "accumulator not found: no metadata for batch 18446744073709551615",

        "msgCount": 111019935
    }
}`
undefined says What command are you using to run your node? (and if you built it locally, what nitro version did you use?)
undefined says The machine crashed once during synchronization, so I deleted the data directory and tried again, now it's normal.
undefined says ok so I update like this:
1) pull the latest version
2) stop docker process
3) wait for the docker process to stop
4) start with the new command `docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:<latest_version> --l1.url=https://l1-mainnet-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.feed.input.url=ws://local-relay-address:9642`
One last question: is `--l1.url=//l1-mainnet-node:8545` correct or do I have to insert my alchemy api link to eth-mainnet?
undefined says You have to add a valid L1 RPC node (your Alchemy node url for example)
undefined says I just came across your message, as I had the same question about running an Arbitrum Nova node, specifically an archive node.

I'm running the below for my Nitro (One) node. Would I keep the nitro.tar reference when attempting to sync a Nova archive node?

`--init.url=" https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" --node.caching.archive`

Also, was there ever a 'Classic' Nova chain? Thanks
undefined says I'm the founder of a web3 software development company with focus on blockchain technology. Currently, we are acquiring new clients, so we are looking for on-call developers especially familiar with node.js and solidity.
Please fill out the following short form if you’re interested
https://forms.gle/ri2US2YNLybpSZ318
undefined says I have pulled the latest version, stopped the docker process (docker ps gives me an empty table) and run this command:
`docker run --rm  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.0-beta.16-ad8cfe5 --l1.url=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/45...vsac_GY3 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.feed.input.url=ws://local-relay-address:9642`

It gives me:
`Version: v2.1.0-beta.16-ad8cfe5, time: 2023-09-13T11:43:42-06:00`
`Sample usage: /usr/local/bin/nitro --help`
`Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --l1.url`

What to do?
undefined says Use the below flag instead of `--l1.url`:

`--parent-chain.connection.url=`
undefined says Not sure if the node will throw another error after that's sorted, but I also use the below for the chain ID:

`--chain.id=42161`
undefined says For reference here's how I'm running my Arbitrum Nitro node, which is an archive node (5.8TB) while redirecting pre-Nitro requests to an Arbitrum Classic node, also hosted on this system:

`docker run -d -it --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 --restart unless-stopped --stop-timeout 300 --log-opt max-size=10m --name arbitrum-nitro-mainnet --cpus 4 --memory 16g -v /arbitrum/nitro/mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum -p <internal-ip>:8547:8547 -p <internal-ip>:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.0-beta.16-ad8cfe5 --parent-chain.connection.url= http://<internal-ip>:8545 --chain.id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.port=8547 --http.vhosts=* --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.port=8548 --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-archive.tar" --node.rpc.classic-redirect= http://<internal-ip>:8549 --node.caching.archive --ipc.path="/home/user/.arbitrum/arbitrum.ipc"`
undefined says Seems like this is working thanks (relay feed on port 9642 should work as well right)?
Why they don't change that in their docs?

undefined says It's truly disheartening to witness that you fell victim to a scam. I believe it's challenging to trace the perpetrators here, but there are some tools that could potentially assist you. By the way, could you please share how the scam occurred?
undefined says It was at the time of a particular arb dodge
undefined says I search on google about the event, wrong website, careless and signed all messages in my wallet, and the robbery was on
undefined says Withnn no out knowing it all gone
undefined says That's unfortunate, my friend. I would advise you to refrain from using that wallet again. Sometimes, lessons can come at a high cost.
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum @Ana 💙 Arbitrum @hunter | Offchain Labs spam , please delete 👀
undefined says Question for offchain labs
undefined says Stake token    The token that your chain's validators must stake in order to participate in your chain. This is hardcoded to $ETH for now, but future versions of Orbit chains will let you specify an arbitrary ERC-20 token contract here.
undefined says Is this future arbitrary ERC-20 token able to be a arbitrum native token? Or is it ETH native?
undefined says Whats the system requirements for running an Orbit chain?
Same as a full node? Any gotchas if I wanted to run my orbit chain on the cloud and expose a public IP for testing?
undefined says Arbitrum Orbit Chains are optimistic rollups. They use a fraud-proof mechanism to ensure the validity of transactions, which is less computationally expensive than using zero-knowledge proofs. This makes Orbit Chains more scalable and efficient, while still providing the same security guarantees as Ethereum.
undefined says @AnthonyE @RedManStan_0xMT 
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1121541449125740564
undefined says You can choose to read the interpretation of Orbit by the team members. At the same time, it is mentioned that more explanations will continue to be updated
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Yeah for sure. It can be an Arb native ERC20 token as well.
undefined says It depends if you wanna run fullnode or an archive. currently we specify it as archive, cause in the process we deploy a blockscout explorer instance for you as well which works better which an archive. 
Also because on Devnet, you may not have that much txs/users, things would be so smooth and no need for a strong config, but it is based on the amount of usage of your devnet for sure.
undefined says I went through the docs and I have a question: does the batch-poster need to be funded with the native token of the base chain (Arbitrum goerli for the devnet) in order to post transactions right ?
undefined says I met some difficulties in the final step of deploying a L3 chain. Wondering how to solve this problem?
undefined says worldcoin, bsc and base is going to launch on op stack,  what about nova ?
undefined says Orbit was announced a few weeks ago, and many projects have started building on it. I think there will be a huge number of chains using Orbit instead of Optimism. Optimism will become congested because they are using L2, but Orbit is on L3 and is much cheaper and faster than OPStack. In the coming months, many top players might build on Orbit because of its features and customisation
undefined says Does arbitrum orbit use arbitrum's common sequencer or does its own chain have its own sequencer
undefined says Arbitrum Orbit Chains are optimistic rollups. They use a fraud-proof mechanism to ensure the validity of transactions, which is less computationally expensive than using zero-knowledge proofs. This makes Orbit Chains more scalable and efficient, while still providing the same security guarantees as Ethereum.
undefined says I think it should have its own sequencer. But more information needs to be confirmed by team members
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs @gzeon | Offchain Labs could you confirm pls when online
undefined says currently you need your own sequencer
undefined says we want to add your blockchain to our services, need some test tokens on this steps of development
undefined says Hey mate, Here is the list of faucets to get test tokens : https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/1121961136007426129
undefined says Nice community
undefined says Let's go
undefined says Message to allthe team . Please I sent asset to the Arbitrum contract adress..... Please help me recover my funds..
undefined says If you send funds directly to the foundation's contract address. Your funds will be lost
undefined says Have a look at this info, it might be useful

undefined says 
undefined says Sir, it's been more than a week but the assets that I bridged haven't arrived or returned !!!
undefined says did you reach out to support
undefined says I have already answered it for you in other channels
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1124882997670334554
undefined says try to seek help from #📬︱support   and #💬︱general 
thanks
undefined says need help
undefined says #🚀︱odyssey-faq
undefined says Is there anything I can help you? If it is an arbitrum one or nova problem, #💬︱general #📬︱support  can help you better
undefined says If I cross-chain my assets from arbitrum layer3 to arbitrum layer2, do I need to wait seven days?
undefined says It shouldn't be necessary. Just like nova, one. It's more of a bridge through the ecosystem app bridge.
undefined says I am eligible and I am not claimed That because my wallet been hacked from bot 

I knew that my wallet have problem  on that time
What I have to do??
undefined says 
undefined says What’s the issues?
undefined says When i try to bridge my funds to other network it fails when i have enough gas for it. Failed when moving to other addresses as well
undefined says Message me with the issues screenshot
undefined says It keeps showing up as this
undefined says @Ricardo__Gordon | Arbitrum
undefined says Either you don't have enough eth in your wallet to cover for gas fees or you need to change this into "market"
undefined says Problem resolved, thank you so much!!!!
undefined says Glad to help 👍
undefined says No fraud proof on the layer3?
undefined says What should I buy to vote?
On which shell?
undefined says please check the guides: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#arb
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/how-tos/vote-dao-proposals
undefined says 
undefined says Is the "Customizable fee token" feature available now?
undefined says What is the contract size limit for Nova?
undefined says It seems it is 24kb for Arb. One
Is it the same for Nova?
undefined says It’s the same
undefined says Yes, it’s available, anyone can customize it.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labswhen i transfer my asset from orbit to arbitrum,is there a fault proof?
undefined says yep
undefined says Yes, it has.
undefined says Cool, is there a doc URL about "Customizable fee token" ?
undefined says Or is there some demo code about "Customizable fee token" ?
undefined says cc @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is there a way to customize some aspects of orbit chains directly modifying the base chain contracts ?
undefined says For example, I would like that only one specific evm account can make transactions in the orbit chain
undefined says Yes, you can customise as much as you like the codebase (node software or contracts)
undefined says 
undefined says How to ensure that the sequencer does not censor transactions ? Without trusting only it’s promise ?
undefined says We explain it here:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer

You can submit your tx directly bypassing sequencer. If sequencer doesn’t even pick it up there, you can force include it, so completely bypass sequencer
undefined says Can I configure my own block time on my L3 Orbit chain or does it depend on which L2 I’m settling on? For example, can I configure a 1 second block time but settle onto One?
undefined says And can I use all Arbitrum One tokens on my L3 Orbit chain if it settles on One or does every token need to be bridged to my L3?
undefined says I’m guessing I have to bridge all tokens between my L3 and Arb One, that’s done through the official bridge app right
undefined says But I can’t find any info in the docs about whether I can configure the block time to be faster than the block time of the underlying Arb One chain
undefined says yes when you deploy an L3, a bridge from L2 <-> L3 will be deployed as well, and tokens are bridged through that
undefined says right now it's fixed at minimum of 250 ms block time, but new blocks only post whenever a new transaction posts; in future upgrade, we will make this configurable; and no, its not dependent on the L2 block time that it's deployed on
undefined says Ok that sounds great thanks for the reply
undefined says Do transactions on my L3 have instant Time to Finality as soon as they are included in a block? Or is there some kind of chain reorg possibility?
undefined says Depends on the definition of finality; do you need to know for sure that a transaction will not be disputed via fraud proof? or just know that your call is provable?
undefined says I guess just provable. The transaction would be a bet placed so I just need to know that it won’t just disappear for some reason and that I can take actions based on its finality
undefined says I want to keep the game going and not have to wait 30 seconds or several minutes for confirmation
undefined says For example, using Polygon I would have to wait 32 blocks to be certain that a chain reorg won’t cause the transaction to disappear. On my L3 is there any similar possibility of the transaction disappearing after the sequencer has soft confirmed it?
undefined says reorgs are rare on Arbitrum; you could consider it "final enough" as soon as the validator has ordered and published the transaction on its feed (which is technically shorter than even 1 block), as long as you trust the validator.  there's various levels of caution you could exercise, if the transaction's value carries a great deal of weight.
undefined says if it's your own L3, then the validator will most likely be run by a third party that you trust. if you want to wait until there's contractual proof of the tx, you can wait until the Sequencer posts the sequence of transactions to L2 (in practice, likely every few minutes)
undefined says Thanks for the reply. One more question (sorry I just discovered Orbit and am blown away by the prospect of building my own blockchain) On my own L3 I will be running the sequencer correct? So this means my costs for running my L3 are the validator rewards and the gas cost of posting the sequence of transactions to L2 every few minutes?
undefined says In your QuickStart: Launch an Orbit chain docs your prerequisites say I need at least 1.5 Goerli ETH to cover gas costs. But Alchemy only gives away 0.02 Goerli ETH per day and quiknode gives 0.05 per day. From where can I get 1.5?
undefined says No worries I found some, you can buy unlimited amounts of Goerli ETH at testnetbridge dot com it costs $0.19 per token
undefined says Need help
undefined says anybody here
undefined says What’s up Buddy
undefined says Hey I'm building L3 orbit chain locally. How do I set the batch posting period (intervals) of Batch Posters? I guess it is set to default value of 1 hour, but cannot find how to customize it. I tried to change 'futureBlocks' and 'futureSeconds' from 'SequencerInbox.MaxTimeVariation' while calling `RollupCreator.createRollup` function, with `config` argument -- but it didn't work. Anyone can help me? 🥹
undefined says 
undefined says I also looked at nitro codebase to see if there's somewhere I can configure the period of Batch Poster, posting L3 Tx batches, but failed. I thought it is somewhat related to `BatchPollDelay` from `arbnode/batch_poster.go` but couldn't find exactly how to set the batching intervals. Am I missing something here?
undefined says I think it's called BatchPostingDelay or something? Run the node with --help and look at the batch poster options. I think it's called something delay
undefined says It's a command line argument to set it
undefined says Yes you can
undefined says What is the issue
undefined says most likely a service provider will be running your sequencer; unless you are very experienced at dev ops, it's highly advisable to delegate that responsibility as managing uptime, load balancing, etc can be challenging if your app hits significant adoption.
undefined says you are correct on what the basic costs are (other than infrastructure cost)
undefined says Thank you so much it helped me a lot 🙂
undefined says I’ve deployed successfully and cloned the orbit-setup-script from GitHub but struggling with Docker. Do you have an example Dockerfile I could use for the setup?
undefined says hey, i'm trying to start an Orbit Layer 3 network on Arbitrum Goerli using the public preview guide. 

I've deployed all the `orbit-setup-script` howver when i look at `docker logs nitro` 

I'm seeing:
```
Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/Layer3: permission denied
```

This is in the container logs is anyone having any issues here?
undefined says Never mind! this is my issue, I think it's because I've setup the `orbit-setup-script`  as `root` so when docker runs, it does not have permissions over the volume mount at all
undefined says all fixed! it was extremely smooth process to deploy a layer3 testnet chain using the orbit scripts. 

I have some feedback at the very end step:
1. we specificly require node v16 (my version of ubuntu targets v12)
2. If you bump into permission erros, check that the container can access the filesystem on the volume mount. most likely you created the ./config directory as `root`
lastly the steps to setup the rollup contracts simply say:
```
PRIVATE_KEY="blah" L2_RPC_URL="https://bla..." L3_RPC_URL="http://blah..." yarn run setup
```

I suspect might be missing instructions to first issue `yarn install` to install the node modules

secondly the command implies it's a 1 liner command, where as this actually needs to be more like:
```
export PRIVATE_KEY="blah"
export L2_RPC_URL="https://bla..."
export L3_RPC_URL="http://blah..." 
yarn run setup
```

since the script is expecting environment variables
undefined says I’ve only ever created a Dockerfile that uses npm, any chance you can post the code needed to run yarn in my Dockerfile?
undefined says no worries I figured out Dockerfile and successfully ran `docker-compose up -d`
undefined says 
undefined says am trying to post the error I get next but the bot wont let me
undefined says `Running ethDeposit Script to Deposit ETH from Arbitrum Goerli to your account on appchain ... 💰💰💰💰💰💰
Error occurred: Error: could not detect network (event="noNetwork", code=NETWORK_ERROR, version=providers/5.7.2)`
undefined says presumably it means my localhost 8449 RPC address, do I need to enter my RPC address somewhere to fix this error?
undefined says My RPC address is in this command so it should be picked up from that in the ethDeposit Script `PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey" L2_RPC_URL="goerli-url" L3_RPC_URL="localhost-8449-url" yarn run setup`
undefined says I have the correct address in the real command I had to edit the above so the bot allows me to post it
undefined says in the setup.ts file this isn't working: `const L3Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(L3_RPC_URL)`
undefined says is it something to do with L3_RPC_URL being a http instead of https? I'm on iMac
undefined says so I get as far as this console message and then it breaks because L3Provider is not set: 
`console.log(
      'Running ethDeposit Script to Deposit ETH from Arbitrum Goerli to your account on appchain ... 💰💰💰💰💰💰'
    )
    const oldBalance = await L3Provider.getBalance(config.chainOwner)
    await ethDeposit(privateKey, L2_RPC_URL, L3_RPC_URL)`
undefined says I fixed it. The issue was the docs said to enter my RPC url localhost:8459 which didnt work but it worked when I used 127.0.0.1:8459
undefined says my L3 chain is running and producing blocks 🙂 Couple of issues with the block explorer: 

The block explorer purple top header area doesn't update

When I go to a smart contract address and click to the Code tab and then click on Verify and Publish the page shows an Internal Server Error message. I need to be able to verify my smart contracts so I can listen to emitted events from them
undefined says Mind sharing your explorer? I haven't got my l3 to run yet
undefined says I cant its only running on localhost:4000
undefined says Oh no worries I'm trying to run on a VPS
undefined says I'm on iMac. It was all pretty straightforward apart from the few hurdles with Dockerfile and having to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
undefined says Ook I'll try on server thanks
undefined says Can anyone from team tell me if possible to go mainnet with arb L3? App specific
undefined says Anyone getting this error ``` Error occurred: Error: could not detect network (event="noNetwork", code=NETWORK_ERROR, version=providers/5.7.2)  reason: 'could not detect network',
  code: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
  event: 'noNetwork' ```
undefined says yes that was happening to me because I was using http:// localhost:8449 as my RPC in the yarn setup command. Use http:// 127.0.0.1:8449 instead and it will work
undefined says I got same error ```   reason: 'could not detect network',
  code: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
  event: 'noNetwork' ```
undefined says i think when i set mine up it just worked without changing the name localhost to an ip
undefined says I am trying to run on a VPS you try on server?
undefined says I need to see the decoded input data for transactions on my L3 but the block explorer's verify contract page is still an Internal server error message. Any ETA on when this will be fixed?
undefined says You can query your node via debugging rpc methods to have it
undefined says But I need end users to be able to go to the transaction page and see the decoded input data to verify it against another source.
undefined says just wondering for Orbit/L3, do we have a provider like conduit  for OP?
undefined says I have created L3 and was trying to transfer my funds from l2 to l3 using bridge address provided but it is not working then how to transfer funds?
undefined says When I check on explorer gas limit was predicted correctly and I got this error 
Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [execution reverted]
undefined says Have you been directed yet on what to do?
undefined says Not yet
undefined says Do you want to transfer erc20 or ethers?
undefined says I want ethers to transfer on l3
undefined says Apologies if this has already been asked before. when I try to trace a transaction on arbitrum-one. the json rpc respond have fields like beforeEVMTransfers and afterEVMTransfers.

May I know what the field imply? is it related to l1 -> l2?
undefined says I am building provider raas.build
undefined says So you need to call your inbox address with function depositEth.
undefined says It may help you: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1079908966160674856
undefined says Hey, could you send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com ?
undefined says I have emailed from team at raas.build Thank you
undefined says On Arbitrum scan I pasted the address of inbox it is not showing the depositEth
undefined says I can only see these functions
undefined says 
undefined says This is proxy contract, you need click `is this proxy` to let arbiscan know it is proxy contract. Or you can verify it here: https://arbiscan.io/proxyContractChecker
undefined says Okay thank you
undefined says Now I am able to bridge the eth but how to transfer erc 20tokens
undefined says Call gateway router, it will be more difficulty than ethers, you can see tutorial here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit
undefined says Is the Orb L3 not meant to be ran on server side?  Local host no issue. Thank you
undefined says Okay will try
undefined says Hey, you should be able to run it on a VPS (I'm assuming that's where you're testing the deployment, right?)
In what step are you blocked and what error are you getting?
undefined says Im getting this error on last step ```  reason: 'could not detect network',
  code: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
  event: 'noNetwork'  ```
undefined says our Provider Launchpad dashboard is complete we are working on one click server side and auto SSL
undefined says Did you open the related port?
undefined says Running smoothly!! 🙌🏾💪🏾 thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  In our user dashboard we want to give the option to connect to "our" Testnet chain id or have there own chain id. Do you know if it's possible to have multiple chains connect to the same L3 chain id? Thank you
undefined says It depends on your wallet, but mostly yes, metamask support different rpc url for the same chain id, but you need to specific the Name to avoid click wrong.
undefined says I'm sry I phrased that incorrectly.  I mean for other L3 to settle on "our" L3 if that  make sense? Think of it being like what Arbitrium is doing. Getting fees from L3 chains. I'm trying to see a way or know what to modify to basically be a "L4" if that make sense ?
undefined says You mean build another rollups on your layer3? Yes, you can do it, but our public ui doesn’t support this, you can modify the code to support your l3 as the base chain: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/orbit-deployment-ui
undefined says Yes we are currently modifying the ui code and integrating into our own, Is there any documentation on how to modify exactly? We will figure it out just asking. Thank you
undefined says Hmm, I don’t think we have docs about that now.
undefined says No worries we are anslytizing the code   Thank you
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  is there a ETA when L3 able to settle on mainnet?   If it's as simple as chaining chain id to mainnet and use ETH we are willing to test the outcome.
undefined says You can do it now by resetting the ui (set the base network to arb1 or nova).
undefined says I tried both it says wrong network but im sure I can do it manually if its possible? Is tehre any other project on L3 mainnet? Thanks
undefined says You can do it manually, our license already approve to let everyone deploy l3 on arb1/nova
undefined says Thank you
undefined says I'd like to experiment with Orbit but I need 1.5 AGOR. Faucets give very low amounts of it. Can anyone give me that amount? I can later write my address. Thanks
undefined says I'm sure sharing wallets isn't allowed here.  Google Testnetbridge tyere yih can get goerli eth and bridge on Testnet.  Nevermind the $AGOR the team needs to update the documentation.  Thank you
undefined says Thank you so much Now able to transfer erc20 tokenss
undefined says I was trying to set up the on docker and got this message  in docker logs



can anybody please explain?

Sample usage: /usr/local/bin/nitro --help 

Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/L3Nitro Orbit Chain: permission denied
undefined says Seems to be some permission issue but let the team respond.
undefined says This error message is comming on the container of nitro.
undefined says How long does this process take?
undefined says This is where were at. We are on auto deployment need a lil support from the team and we will blow up!
undefined says try running the commands here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node#note-on-permissions
undefined says also try removing spaces from the folder name "L3Nitro Orbit Chain"
undefined says Ensure the sequencer is running. If so, what are its logs?
undefined says Rookie move I should've not did with spacing from begging that's from me tearing down and rebuilding 15 x's in a row 😂🥹🥹 I'll update the output thanks for the support!
undefined says 
undefined says these are latest logs

undefined says full logs? is the sequencer and delayed sequencer enabled in the config?
undefined says Sry about the link won't happen again my apologies
undefined says No worries the bot's settings are pretty tight because otherwise we get a ton of spam
undefined says Understandable running a community is a headache I've done it few times 😂😂  the logs are coming up but it seems to be still deploying contracts over time it has been running g for about a hour now contracts are just being deployed.  You can see explorer IP and port from image
undefined says These are full logs of nitro and the yarn process
undefined says Ok that's good, a delayed message was sequenced at 20:08. I'm assuming that's when you ran the setup script?
undefined says Yes correct
undefined says and I'm assuming 127.0.0.1:8449 is the RPC of your L3 sequencer?
undefined says If you query it for the balance of 0x95d0c5fbc2c9ca1a70047c9ee84972362e7b28f4 what does it return?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs  is this the time it will take to deploy? We are building a "one click provider" Saas infrastructure   We will need to add time frames to whitepaper etc. we'd like to know how to speed up the process. Thanks
undefined says Does it just take a while or is it stuck?
undefined says I think it by default waits for the deposit to become marked as safe on L2
undefined says I'm on mobile now a team member of mines is here can you tell how to "query" the balance. Thank you sir
undefined says I'm specifically asking to query it against that exact RPC on the computer running the script
undefined says Okay understood.  We also build OP Stack contracts bound right away do different process all good
undefined says I think it should take about 10 minutes for the deposit to become marked as safe
undefined says If you want to trust the L2 sequencer not to reorg to lower that wait, you can tell the L3 delayed sequencer to ignore L2 finality and sequence delayed messages immediately
undefined says Oh ok here's a new log "one more log is printed
INFO [07-27|20:27:34.112] data poster transactions confirmed       previousNonce=3 newNonce=4 previousL1Block=31,978,428 newL1Block=31,979,600
"
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs when we run the "yarn setup" command then  it's working from more than an hour and logs are printed like this
undefined says Documentation? If none available I will start documenting myself and hand to you guys when I'm done as we need to perfect this ASAP out MVP will be ready within the week
undefined says Thank you for the assistance
undefined says In that case it's probably stuck not just taking a bit. Try doing the balance query against that RPC I mentioned earlier. And confirm that RPC is indeed the L3 sequencer RPC URL.
undefined says Checking
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs I have tried checking the balance.

but it's just loading and loading not returning any reponse. can you check I'm using correct one?
undefined says Our software we awant to launch in minutes we appreciate your support. This process is taking very long but we will dial it in to build and function properly per the docker compose xml file. We do plan on building bridge UI with the Orbit build.
undefined says 
undefined says gotta be careful with links LOL
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs 

you can verify the command

PRIVATE_KEY="" L2_RPC_URL="goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc" L3_RPC_URL="127.0.0.1:8449" yarn run setup
undefined says The latest logs from nitro are here.
undefined says You might probably run this script the second time with different chain config right? If so, you need delete the chain data on ./config first, because your l3 is using the chain state of last time config.
undefined says This is the case thank you we will update.
undefined says Np
undefined says i have a question
i wanna use the arbitrum one like wallet and create invoices for users to pay, but i bont know can i can do it (
undefined says I was given the task to write a telegram bot in which users will pay their tariffs through Arbitrum one, as I understand it, an invoice is generated through the API, sent to the user, he pays, and the result is returned with a webhook, but how can I do this in Arbitrum one?
undefined says I personally am a beginner in cryptocurrency, so I have no experience in such matters (but it is urgent (
undefined says this is part of the technical task

```The ʼPayʼ and ʼTariffsʼ buttons will redirect to the message "Choose your tariff"
 with buttons for 4 types of tariff

 each button should redirect to payment in crypto (here it depends on which payments you worked with. preferably USDT (TRC20) or USDT (Arbitrum One), the bot should check the confirmation of the trace via Txid) I can implement the payment on Binancepay myself, but I want  everything was automatic.

 after that, the information about the payment should be sent to the google table with the user's nickname and his number, and he should receive a message in response that everything is successful, and I should be able to manually send messages with access data to each individual.  because I am not yet able to create it automatically.```
undefined says first i want to understand if my option i.e create invoices and get result via webhook is possible
undefined says sorry, my english is bad (
undefined says You can use arbitrum one as a network, we have full evm rpc method which allows you to interact with blockchain: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/1b10711dc5f2eeefebc8c9f07d5c5f580534f703/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol#L309-L327 , you can see those api and find which fit your demands.
undefined says Hey, anyone here knows how the Orbit chain settlement works? Like is there an L2 tx that shows the settlement?
undefined says Do you have another example of how to do this in another programming language? For example, Python, JavaScript, or others?
undefined says when bridging tokens its great that we can ignore L2 finality and sequence delayed messages immediately, its such a good UX for the user to be able to click on a button and his tokens instantly transfer from his Arbitrum wallet to his L3 wallet. So in the interests of minimizing the time it takes to withdraw his tokens from L3 to L2 what is the minimum practical challenge period I can set on my L3 chain?
undefined says are there any technical limitations (like needing a signed signature maybe) why I couldn't create a L1 to L3 bridge that sends the tokens to L2 and then to L3 in the background without the user needing to worry about the L2 step?
undefined says i need use web3 ?
undefined says or maybe i can use Arbitrum Api ?
for create invoices and get results
undefined says Does anyone have an example of how this can be implemented in Python or JavaScript or another similar language?
undefined says That isn't a matter of challenge time, it's a matter of the delayed sequencer. Adding the CLI options (or equivalent JSON config options) `--node.delayed-sequencer.use-merge-finality=false --node.delayed-sequencer.finalize-distance=0` should do that (try 1 if 0 doesn't work). The only implication here should be that you're trusting the L2 sequencer not to reorg, and if the L2 reorgs then the L3 will also reorg.
undefined says But the L2 practically never reorgs right?
undefined says Does that mean I can also do instant L3 to L2 withdrawals as well as deposits?
undefined says Because I thought the reason it takes a week to withdraw from L2 to L1 is because that’s the duration of the challenge period
undefined says L1 doesn't reorg a week of history. The reason why the challenge period is a week is because that's how long Vitalik theorized a censorship attack could last before social consensus steps in.
undefined says Oh I thought it was a week because that’s how long they gave the two disagreeing stakers to play the challenge game
undefined says The challenge game can be played very quickly (I'd guess an hour would be more than enough normally), the concern is censorship attacks yeah
undefined says Good evening, please advise on the algorithm to create an invoice for payment and receive the payment result on web3.
undefined says Will it reorg automatically or L3 have to adapt at same time? This is very important in our case as we plan on have over 100 users in the first 2 months thank you
undefined says If the L2 reorgs, the L3 will automatically reorg if it sequenced a delayed message that got reorged
undefined says We have emailed chainsafe we want to modify the rollup contract to add "affiliate" system in the contract so any other L3. On our platform  can get a fee with out breaking the system for future updates.
undefined says I'm curious about this as well
undefined says Pls im trying to deploy on the arbitrum blockchain but I cant seem to find faucet 
Pls how do i get arbitrum test faucet for testing purposes ??
undefined says Can anyone help me with this
undefined says 
undefined says wow i used layer zero's testnet bridge to simply buy Goerli eth
undefined says How much do i have to pay to get Goerli eth ?
and can you send in link here
undefined says you can buy Goerli ETH at testnetbridge dot com its about 19 cents per token
undefined says YO
undefined says This is Ben from qredo qsign - cross chain control functionality.  I'm trying to reach a mod who might be able to spend some time with me and discuss collaboration opportunities.  Can someone dm pls.
undefined says What is the recommended way to enable gasless transactions for users of my L3?
undefined says Easy way to turn on wss for the block explorer or my node?
undefined says I figure its probably easy, will look later when I have time but figured id ask here
undefined says can I edit the minL2BaseFee easily or do I need to reset everything and start again?
undefined says How can I verify a smart contract on the blockscout explorer? Verify page still showing Internal server error. In general the explorer is pretty buggy, is this just because its on localhost maybe?
undefined says I need help. I want to get the transaction amount that was sent to my wallet, but I only receive some hashes and the 'to' address does not match my wallet. However, when I check on Oklink, everything is displayed correctly. Can you suggest how to fix this? Python web3
undefined says how i can get that info using python web3 ?
undefined says what VPS service would you recomend for hosting an Orbit chain?
undefined says Is there a tutorial for deploying an Orbit chain to a VPS instead of localhost? Seems tricky using docker-compose in prod
undefined says how i can get Contract ABI ?
undefined says i just need get Token Transfers from transaction
but i cannot (
undefined says Got my chain mostly on the cloud
undefined says Cant get ngnix setup right super annoying
undefined says everything works fine except wss. I can get it working on that machine locally but cant use wss remotely. Spent so long on it today i dont wanna talk about it lol
Cant stright use the ip address and port ether so maybe its a firewall thing, but would assume i couldn't remote connect to my block explore or metamask to the chain.
It's just wss, and like i said i can access it fine on the same machine
remote i get 404 or 200 depending on the header settings
undefined says @Ricardo__Gordon | Arbitrum  Could you help me?
I'm running a nitro node locally, and when I execute "l1GatewayRouter.outboundTransfer" I incorrectly estimate the gasLimit, causing the transaction on L2 to fail.
Since then nitro has been prompting the following error:

Error while recording                    err="recording failed: blockNum 39, hash expected 0x1c25c78159c7b0af6c2bd7ed559f47bb3be9a1b7992a11d4192008f8a7a4b12c, got 0xf7caae5f54f35f6aa5ed58bd039033e71739b4b1720685bb4e89cf026181a740" status=2
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says I have to disable the block validator. But I think there should be anther better solution.
undefined says Hey, I'm assuming you're running an orbit chain, right? Is it the standard codebase or does it have any customisation? 
Also, can you provide some more lines of logs before and after that one?
undefined says I'd say you'd need a different economic design, because, for starters, you need to provide the batch poster with enough funds to post batches on the L2. If you want a more standard approach, you might want to take a look at Account Abstraction, which proposes a design that allows gasless transactions via a Paymaster contract (some sources: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337 and for paymasters => https://alchemy.com/blog/account-abstraction-paymasters )
undefined says Yeah, we are still working out the details of the block explorer, so some inconsistencies are to be expected. I'll note down your feedback, thanks!
undefined says For web3.py questions, you might get better support in their discord server. From an on-chain perspective, you can get the information of a transaction by querying its receipt with eth_getTransactionReceipt
undefined says Have you tried contacting your cloud provider in case it's a network issue?
Also, can you send rpc requests to your node from outside your machine? (Directly, without metamask)
undefined says Also can you add the latest version of blockscout instead of older version in the container?
undefined says after like a day of wasted time lmao the official website of nginx has an article about "A small NGINX recipe that makes Geth’s RPC and Websocket interface remotely accessible on a node" 
follow its formatting for nginx and use  Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider with http instead of ws and you can connect
this helped me over come a response of 200 instead of 101, i was using gcp and cloudflare for dns
undefined says it works great now though, but any other source about websockets and nginx failed me
undefined says Glad to know you found the solution, and thanks for sharing 🙂
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Thank you. Yes, I'm running an orbit chain, and I commented lines 203-207 of tx_processor.go.
I'm not sure if it's this change that's causing the error.
undefined says 
undefined says Yeah, the error you're seeing is because the fraud proofs aren't working because you've modified the node software's state transition function but not the fraud proof's replay binary target
undefined says you can do `make build-replay-env` to rebuild the replay environment. Then, update the wasm module root on the rollup contract via the owner with setWasmModuleRoot. You can get the wasm module root you need after building the replay environment with `cat target/machines/latest/module-root.txt`
undefined says finally, you need to make sure any validators have that replay binary so they can validate the chain. You can look at "Download WAVM machines" to see how it's done in docker, or if you're running a validator outside of docker locally it should work after the `make build-replay-env`
undefined says still trying to figure out how to host my Orbit chain online. I cant use docker-compose because each component needs to be setup as a separate application. Is nitro in the docker-compose file the same nitro node used to run the main chain and I just need to set it up to run my chain instead?
undefined says Is there any kind of guide for getting an Orbit chain online and not just running locally?
undefined says It's highly recommended that you figure out how to get docker to work; it's possible to build locally but there is a large chain of dependencies
undefined says Thanks,  but I got 0xda4e3ad5e7feacb817c21c8d0220da7650fe9051ece68a3f0b1c5d38bbb27b21 via cat target/machines/latest/module-root.txt. It is same as before🧐
undefined says are you doing this in docker or outside of docker?
undefined says if you build the `nitro-node-dev` docker image it'll alternatively be in there
undefined says I build the nitro image then got it from the container
undefined says ps: git@github.com:OffchainLabs/nitro.git tag v2.1.0-beta.4
undefined says 
undefined says My coworker and I build images separately, and we get this same hash
undefined says only the -dev container builds the wasm, the rest just download the last consensus release
undefined says if you want to do it in docker, build the nitro-node-dev image instead of the regular nitro-node one
undefined says I got it, thanks
undefined says I successfully got orbit setup on a VPS and can run docker-compose.yaml and I can see the block explorer on http:// myIPaddress:4000 but I'm stuck on the last part trying to run the yarn run setup command, I'm getting this error:
`reason: 'could not detect network',
  code: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
  event: 'noNetwork'`
undefined says port 8449 is open. In the docker-compose.yaml file I have edited the line:
 `nitro:
    image: offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.0-beta.6-152b9ff
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8449:8449"` 
to this:
`nitro:
    image: offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.1.0-beta.6-152b9ff
    ports:
      - "139.444.756.112:8449:8449"` 
is this correct to do this?
undefined says @LockCEO I'm getting the exact same error you got on the last step of setting this up on a VPS, how did you fix it?
undefined says port 8449 is open on my VPS, is there anything I need to do on Cloudflare side? But I think it's not being blocked on Cloudflare too but cant confirm that
undefined says Everyone's preference is different we built out our own  contabo or digitalocean  these 2 are good options. Thanks
undefined says I remember you were stuck on that last step for a few days how did you end up fixing it? I'm in the exact same spot now, have tried everything but cant get the yarn run setup command to work because my L3 RPC URL isnt right
undefined says You don't need to change the ip, if your ip is public and your port is open, you can also visit it via 139.444.756.112:8449.
undefined says IP is public and port is open but just can’t get past that no network error
undefined says You need reset it to 127.0.0.1
undefined says I reset it to 127.0.0.1:8449 but I still get same error
undefined says Can you provide more details about your errors? Like what ip:port you query failed. And if it is your l3 rpc, where did you send this request, are they on the same machine? Or different machine with different ip?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I've setup the orbit-setup-script on a remote VPS but when I run this final setup command I get the no network error:
`PRIVATE_KEY="0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" L2_RPC_URL="my_alchemy_RPC" L3_RPC_URL="http:// 139.162.246.110:8449" yarn run setup`
undefined says Can you visit 127.0.0.1:8449 in the same vps?
undefined says its a remote VPS sorry how can I do that?
undefined says is there a command I can run in my terminal while signed into the VPS to check that?
undefined says ```
curl localhost:8449 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```
undefined says no I get following error 
`curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8449 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server`
undefined says 
undefined says its hard to post results and commands with this forum's bot it deletes everything
undefined says but I can ssh into the running VPS and do stuff no problem so the server is running
undefined says and I can successfully ping the IP address from a terminal window from my computer
undefined says You got this at your vps or your local machine? If is your vps, seems your node is not running, if is your local machine, you might not open the vps' port.
undefined says I got that error in the terminal window of my remote VPS. Thats where I pasted the curl command, into the terminal of the remote VPS after logging in with ssh
undefined says 
undefined says I have successfully run the docker-compose up -d command and get success messages that postgres_1, das-server_1, nitro_1 and blockscout_1 are running
undefined says Can you take a look at your node? `docker-compose logs -f nitro` and `docker ps` to see if it is running.
undefined says How about the log?
undefined says 
undefined says aye I cant post anything, but yes you're right the node isnt running
undefined says `Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/Digitex Goerli: permission denied
orbit-setup-script_nitro_1 exited with code 1`
undefined says Oh, if so you need grant the permission or use sudo to start.
undefined says but I'm logged in as root. I just ran `sudo docker-compose up -d` but same result
undefined says enter the orbit script dir and chmod -fR 777 ./config
undefined says oh you beauty!!! `docker-compose up -d` just worked and the logs are coming through now. Will try that setup command now
undefined says aye no I still get the same no network error
undefined says You can visit blockscout at remote machine right?
undefined says yes blockscout is working online
undefined says ```curl http:// 139.162.246.110:8449 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```
undefined says Can you try this?
undefined says `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 139.162.246.110 port 8449 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server`
undefined says 
undefined says Can you make sure you open 8449? Because this error quite like your port doesn't open or your cloud server safety group setting.
undefined says it's open, I did `ufw status` and it shows 8449 allowed
undefined says How about your cloud server's Security Groups?
undefined says ok I'll contact their support to check if they're blocking that port maybe. Thanks for your help with this, you pinpointed the problem for me and now I can try to figure out the solution, much appreciated
undefined says @AdamDigitex I ran a stress test on Layer 3 yesterday and found this error. After the error, batch-poster cannot rollup any data to Layer2. How to fix the error? Thanks!
undefined says Is your node still running? How is the logs?
undefined says My node is down, no anther logs i'm afraid
undefined says Just this error logs cause before the node down? Can yo restart the node?
undefined says Since rollup keeps failing, I've used another node rollup some data to L2, so all test txs  on error-node were droped. I'm trying to reproduce this error
undefined says I didn't get my nft also i paid ethereum what should i do
undefined says WARN [08-09|08:36:08.529] DataPoster failed to send transaction    err="oversized data"     nonce=113  feeCap=250,000,000 tipCap=50,000,000
ERROR[08-09|08:36:08.529] failed to replace-by-fee transaction     err="oversized data"     nonce=113  feeCap=250,000,000 tipCap=50,000,000
undefined says What are the logs after this?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Is this log useful?
undefined says The logs between this error and shutdown info log
undefined says take this log
undefined says This node has not been shutdown so far.
undefined says Oh, the logs show your tx failed due to revert, not because your batch poster not working
undefined says I think that the "oversized data" caused the revert.
undefined says the batch poster cannot to call the function "addSequencerL2BatchFromOrigin" due to the "oversized data"
undefined says Your tx reverted before the "oversized data" error, and you can check what your eth_call is. You should receive the revert reason after you send that eth_call.
undefined says transfer ETH
undefined says I want to limit the datasize per L3’s block
undefined says Transfer eth should not use eth_call but eth_sendTransaction
undefined says https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/eth-call
undefined says Our config file doesn't support this, you need to re-write the hardcode number and compile it: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally
undefined says Thank you! I will read it
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says `reason: 'could not detect network',
  code: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
  event: 'noNetwork'`
I just can't get past this error on the final step trying to do yarn run setup. The port 8449 is still closed but its allowed to be opened by iptables and ufw but no service is setup to be listening on it so thats why its still closed. No idea what to do next
undefined says `docker-compose logs -f nitro` shows the logs fine so the node is running
undefined says I also can't see the block explorer at http:// 123.456.78.999:4000 but if I edit the docker-compose.yaml file by changing the 127.0.0.1 part to my IP address in the blockscout section then I can see it
undefined says How about try change 127.0.0.1 to  0.0.0.0?
undefined says OMG that worked!!!
undefined says thank you so much. I got a different error now 🙂 
`Setting the infrastructure fee collector address for the appchain
Error occurred: Error: processing response error (body="{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":77,\"error\":{\"code\":-32000,\"message\":\"intrinsic gas too low\"}}\n", error={"code":-32000}`
undefined says in my orbitSetupScriptConfig.json file I have set my base fee to be `"minL2BaseFee": 10000000` but that worked fine when I did that on local. Or is the error referring to something else?
undefined says I can set my base gas fee to be whatever I want right?
undefined says ok no worries I just ran the yarn run setup command again unchanged and this time it worked. So I'm all set up on a VPS 🙂 👍
undefined says guys your moderator bot is on crack, it blocks half the things I post
undefined says I just typed a message 4 times and cant figure out why its being blocked. No links, no dollar signs, just a regular question
undefined says just tried 3 more times I give up, just trying to ask about gas prices ffs
undefined says Hello! Tell me why in the metamask it says that the transaction failed. Although in fact she passed
undefined says any update?
undefined says Is it possibel hack a Orbit chain with our new verify protocol like AnyTrust but customized?
undefined says Hello, you can see how we calculate gas here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas#breaking-down-the-formula
undefined says I'm sending ~25 transactions a minute to my chain 24 hours a day and its running well so far. But I'm noticing that the memory usage of nitro on my VPS is creeping up everyday, now its at 54.5%. Its a dedicated server with 4GB RAM, 2 CPUs and 80 GB storage with nothing else running on it, do I need more RAM?
undefined says Yes, 4gb ram is not so enough as geth recommand to have 16 gb ram: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/hardware-requirements
undefined says ok thanks for that
undefined says https:// goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0x16c87f8b72b17eb06a8a13a015a11d38760dfea3848db38d36665db02ced75e7
undefined says above is a transaction that posted my rollup onto L2 testnet, how is it possible that the gas cost 56 gwei?
undefined says my VPS is running 24 hours a day so my rollups are being posted every hour to L2 and the tx cost ranges between 3 cents and 31 cents depending on how much data is in there. But then this one comes along and costs 168 usd, is this an error with goerli testnet?
undefined says and now none of my L3 transactions will go through, I get the `intrinsic gas too low` error but nothing has changed on my end. Is this an error out of my control or is there something I can do?
undefined says I though gas on L2 was fixed at 0.1 gwei, how can a tx cost 56 gwei
undefined says It's not fixed, that's just the minimum if there's no congestion. If so many people are transacting that the chain's speed limit is exceeded, then the gas price goes up until gas per second returns to the chain's speed limit.
undefined says I havent been able to do a transaction on my L3 since that 56 gwei rollup tx, `intrinsic gas too low` error is referring to my chain or to the estimated calculation for the L2 rollup tx?
undefined says if I 10x the gas limit on my transactions then they go through, the extra cost is for the estimated gas cost of the rollup tx
undefined says but that doesnt make any sense because gas costs on Goerli Arbitrum are back to normal now, it was just a spike but since then I cant do normal priced txs
undefined says This isn't real time sync, it depends on your last batches, because your node don't know what will the gas price of the base chain be next batch.
undefined says but its done 2 batch posts since then at the normal rate
undefined says both done at 0.1 gwei as normal
undefined says As it has some deny on this, your tx on l2 need to have enough tx to make the it balance, also, you shouldn't fix your tx's gasLimit too since it will also change due to l1's gas change.
undefined says sorry, has anyone run stress tests on orbit? (preferrably on anytrust) and what hardware did you use, I'm evaluating a chain for a potential project in my startup TuRuta in Peru ✌️

I mean TPS limit
undefined says I added gas limit into the fee data because without it my node logs show 2 extra lines for every submitted transaction:
`Caller gas above allowance, capping      requested=21,201,444,796 cap=51,676,483`
`Gas estimation capped by limited funds   original=1,125,899,906,842,624 balance=423,987,979,716,899,040 sent=0 maxFeePerGas=20,000,000 fundable=21,199,398,985`
undefined says but yeah without the gas limit the txs go through no problem. They're still 10x the cost that they were but they go through
undefined says is there any way to tell it the actual current L1 gas to get my tx cost down to normal levels again?
undefined says I've been sending 25 txs per minute 24 hours a day for a few days to my orbit chain on a VPS and its pretty bullet proof. I started it on a 4GB RAM server which wasnt enough so I upped it to 24GB RAM and thats fine
undefined says but I havent hammered it to find out the TPS limit. I suspect its high because its very stable, feels very robust
undefined says You can call this to get the current l1 gas per byte: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L22
undefined says i cant send BNB from BSC to opBNB can anyone help me, please
undefined says yeah I get how it works now, my tx cost on L3 has been gradually dropping since that gas spike so all good
undefined says @pailoeth Be very carefull with scammers trying to send you messages. I believe you're talking about Optimism so...better to talk with them.
undefined says hey have a few questions on Arbitrum Orbit that i dont think i can find in the docs

are orbit chains obliged to share any sequencer profits with the Arbitrum DAO?
undefined says Have you gotten your issue resolved?
undefined says Sequencers usually don't take any profit (they are refunded what they spent for posting transactions on L1). But in any case, Orbit chains are not obliged to share profits with the DAO.
undefined says Have you sent your BNB from BSC to opBNB ?
undefined says I've sent over 300k transactions in the last week but I can't get my block time below ~2.5 seconds. It's like the sequencer can't go any faster than that. If I start sending transactions from 2 different processes the sequencer still plods along at 2.5 seconds for each block and it takes twice as long for txs to go through. How do I speed it up to the maximum possible time of 250ms?
undefined says I only have 2 CPUs on a dedicated VPS but I have 24GB RAM, is it a hardware issue?
undefined says and when running both processes that send txs simultaneously I never get 2 of my txs in the same block. Every block only has one of my txs in it plus the StartBlock tx
undefined says nitro CPU usage is ranging between only 2-7% and memory usage stands at 12% so I don't think its a hardware issue
undefined says Check lnbox
undefined says @Tractors
undefined says hey
undefined says 
undefined says This is the error im facing, the node is running in docker
undefined says 
undefined says this is resolved, used http:// 127.0.0.1:8449  instead of localhost
undefined says trying to send this but getting blocked
undefined says E.g. Optimism details its 1559-like schema with different parameters to Ethereum mainnet. (As i understand Orbit settles back to Arbitrum L2, so i want to be able to understand exactly how Arbitrum prices L2-specific part of gas)
undefined says Hey, this article might help you => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
Basically, high demand will increase the gas price, which might decrease the actual gas used (because of the factor of the L1 gas variable in the formula).
The article explains the formula. For a more practical approach, you also have this how to => https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says ty but  i've been through this many times - it doesn't mention how Arbitrum ramps up its L2 execution gas fee in periods of high demand. For example, Optimism has a page explaining theirs here: https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#accessing-l1-information
undefined says How do I get my block times to 250ms with multiple transactions in each block?
undefined says hmm so I sent the exact same txs to Arbitrum Goerli instead of my L3 and I'm getting the exact same latency so its not an error with Orbit. Trying to figure out now why it takes so long to process a tx to my smart contract
undefined says each transaction is created by sending a command to a nodejs file that does stuff like  `const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(alchemy);` and `const tradingGameContract = new ethers.Contract(tradingGameAddress, tradingGameAbi, signer)` so I guess there's a latency to spinning all that up from scratch each time. I'll look into how to set it up once and then keep calling it
undefined says yeah I got it figured out it was just me doing it wrong, transactions are going through real fast. Sorry for all my dumb questions I'm new to all this
undefined says Can i ask a question "is orbit chain permissionless , can we build our L3 chain without permission of ArbDAO ? " @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says 
undefined says When gas speed higher than 7m/s, the price will follow: F = exp(-a(B-b)) which you can see details here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#l2-gas-fees
undefined says It's permissonless for deploying l3 using orbit
undefined says 1.It's here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/master/precompiles and written by golang. 2. You can use eth_call or eth_estimate (If contract not specific, just use eth_call) to call the precompile contracts.
undefined says thank you
undefined says Hi!🤓
undefined says You’re having issues ?
undefined says how to route message from L2 to L3 (orbit) ?. thanks
undefined says You can send L2 -> L3 messages in the same way that you can send L1 -> L2 messages. It's not synchronous though. If you need synchronicity, you'll have to provide or use an oracle for that. For example an L2 contract can make an static call to an L3 contract via a "Retryable Ticket" (our name for cross-layer messages): see https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging for analogous details which would also apply for L2 to L3
undefined says Thanks for your responce. I get this error for orbit chain id:  throw new errors_1.ArbSdkError(`Unrecognized network ${chainID}.`);
undefined says You can call addCustomNetwork to add your orbit network support: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/dataEntities/networks.ts#L362
undefined says great . thanks
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs , how can we deploy contracts on the orbit chain ?
undefined says Came to ask the same question 😄
undefined says The Quickstart guide (https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart) defaults the l2 url to `https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc    `
undefined says is it possible to point your own Arb Nova currently?
undefined says No , I dont think .Theres very little customization available rn
undefined says How do you get a smart contract onto the QuickStart guide example orbit node to test?
undefined says @tsahi @Churro | Offchain Labs anyone ? hints would be nice to have too
undefined says Of course, orbit is based on nitro tech, and it is evm-compatible, you can deploy your contract as what you do on arb1.
undefined says Do you meet any issues?
undefined says uhmm thats half part said , Can you please check your msges , I mma sending you some config related file
undefined says I didn't receive your message, I have sent a friend request
undefined says Accepted, please check now
undefined says are you there @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  ?
undefined says Yes, but I didn't see any messages, you need to send again
undefined says sent
undefined says Hello! What are the plans to enable Sepolia support?
undefined says Would be in the next release, soon, but we don’t have exact release time yet
undefined says is the Instructions on orbit-setup-script on github (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/orbit-setup-script) outdated?   i cannot find these file nodeConfig.json, orbitSetupScriptConfig.json
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs
undefined says No, when you deploy, two black boxes will be shown on the page, there is a download button on each of them
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/1146085075008622592
undefined says Thanks! What changes are needed for the orbit setup script?
Also, is orbit/nitro deve support for apple m2?
undefined says Here's the guide for launching your obit chain:
https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart

But if your'e asking about orbit and arb sepolia; stay tuned as we update our docs and UI respenctively when it's live
undefined says Thanks! I've been following these instructions. I'm looking to run a custom nitro fork, however, and I'm experiencing build issues on m2.  It seems debian is supported only?

https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/build-nitro-locally
undefined says Yeah those instructions are for debian. I don't think we have official instructions for other distros or mac, but it can mostly be derived from the debian one
undefined says Hey alien, get a life you just joined few days ago and you talk that you know everything
undefined says account= err="no wallet exists, re-run with --l1-batch-poster.wallet.only-create-key to create a wallet"
undefined says anyone help me?
undefined says error getting latest batch count: missing trie node
undefined says What error do you get ?
undefined says orbit-setup-script-nitro-1
undefined says 0x7B8f0B8E09ca522Ad3418fb89B9176f1bc74644c

thanks, no problem
undefined says What is that ?
undefined says This problem was solved after I set the private key of batch-poster.
undefined says Does anyone know what node's forwarding-target should be set to? If I want to start an orbit chain locally
undefined says You can set it to "" if you set sequencer to enable
undefined says How should I transfer ETH from L3 to L2?
undefined says L3 is deployed locally and L2 is Arb-Goerli
undefined says Orbit is launching this month?
undefined says Just do a regular withdraw from your L3, here's an example => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/eth-withdraw
undefined says Orbit is currently available on testnet to prototype and experiment, but it is not production-ready yet. There's no current ETA on when that'll happen, but we are working hard to have it ready as soon as possible.
undefined says What are the steps to add a new precompile?
undefined says Hey, while it is technically possible, we are not providing support for adding new precompiles at the moment.
You'd have to have a solidity interface and a go implementation, and you might have to change other parts of the nitro code base. You can take a look at one of the existing precompiles to see how it is integrated with the rest of the system.
undefined says Is Stylus available within orbit chains?
undefined says On the site, when changing a pair of networks in some places, the metamask extension always offers to switch to the mainnet. And so everything is very fast and detailed 
0x3F04e50691cEE0F64bd2849931848229189DdF1E
undefined says Hence were you able to disconnect from the main net yet ?
undefined says How can I use the deployment tool for a Stylus sepolia chain?
undefined says https://orbit.arbitrum.io/deployment
undefined says it will be, yes, but Stylus is currently alpha and undergoing audits and rapid development so it will be likely a couple months before it's available for production use cases
undefined says Hey any estimate of the gas costs for transactions on a Orbit Anytrust deployment?

Currently Arbitrum One is at 0.1 gwei and Nova at 0.01 gwei -- can I expect another 1 or 2 order of magnitude reduction in the gas costs?

Or is the question itself wrong and the I can set the costs while deploying the chain?
undefined says You can set that at deployment or by calling ArbOwner.setMinimumL2BaseFee as the owner of the chain => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/36a6beaa22ab9d9b3257d210303ce7d49488856f/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L34
undefined says Thanks, I guess the better question would be how much gas would the validator be paying for making rollup txn on Arbitrum One -- my question is as a dapp operator we sponsor the fees for all our user on Arbitrum One, would running my dapp on a self deployed L3 help reduce these gas costs and by how much?
undefined says It's hard to measure without actual numbers, but here are a few things to keep into consideration: 
- Your biggest cost will be the sequencer posting the batches into the parent chain (L2). This cost will be a formula based on the computation costs of the transactions (L3) + cost of posting the batch on L2 + relative cost of posting the batch on L1 (small in its current state, if your batches aren't too big). 
- If you deploy an Anytrust Orbit chain, you will benefit from smaller batches to post on L2 (and, thus, a reduction in costs).
- Reducing the base fee too much opens up the possibility of users spamming your network.
- You can try to get some numbers by running a testnet orbit chain, execute some transactions and scale that to current activity you have in your dapp, so you'll be able to have a clearer image.
undefined says everything works perfect 0x34b111Ee7738604d034687E71dF51Bf2e5Bcec1A
undefined says When there is no transaction, l3 orbit will not produce blocks. Is this normal?
undefined says It's normal
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Is it possible to set it so that no matter whether there is a transaction or not, the block will be generated at an interval?
undefined says I don't think so. And l2 block generation is different from l1 since we don't have a consensus like pos or pow, so l2 doesn't have a fixed block time.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs After the deployment is complete, can I modify the gas cost of l3.
undefined says Is it possible to extract eth from l3 to l2 now?
undefined says If you mean the base fee, yes you can call ArbOwner.setMinimumL2BaseFee as the owner of the chain => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/36a6beaa22ab9d9b3257d210303ce7d49488856f/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L34
undefined says You should be able to withdraw ETH from L3 by calling the ArbSys.withdrawEth method => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/36a6beaa22ab9d9b3257d210303ce7d49488856f/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbSys.sol#L79
undefined says Hej, i was tested a Sepolia, everything works great.
 0x0D3d3211fB37E86EfA97128fb77afC692A4be2Bb
undefined says 0x63cE74Ca776D1cd528AC2F9cb3A85d9dC71f0B35
undefined says how do u minted onchain power ?
undefined says we are also interested in these two requirements. Do you have any progress now?
undefined says yes just tested to call http request from precompiled contract. It works
undefined says probably because the sequencer operate in single entity and doesn't have to be deterministic
undefined says is the rust contract has size limitations ? we have a rust program which may  been more than 1M after compiled
undefined says not yet tested the Stylus
undefined says if you have complex logic, you may use precompiled contract
undefined says just call the Rust app from precompiled contract
undefined says you mean I use  precompiled contract to call  precompiled rust app ?
undefined says I don't know their relations
undefined says or did you write your own precompiled contract to fetch remote http service ?
undefined says yes you can
undefined says yes you can call the rust apps and do http request
undefined says All nodes executing the state transition function have to reach the same state so you definitely can't have non-determinism. Your state transition function also has to be provable on-chain where you definitely can't execute HTTP requests. It is possible to have your precompile implemented in rust though it's much more complex than go since it needs to be compiled into a single binary. This puts you in very unsupported/undocumented territory, but see for example how we include the brotli compression library
undefined says How are precompiles with http calls handled?
undefined says They aren't. If you need an external source of data, your best bet would be to find an oracle provider who can provide the data
undefined says Arbitrum tokens were stolen from my wallet transaction hash 0x8898898dbc166fdb0be359e10851998e9350cde5c0a23e3e2c81f64d47666bf4
  as if I paid for gas they disappeared from Meta Mask
may have been stolen where should I write this?
undefined says Sorry, we can't help on this either because this is a decentralized network, we are sorry to hear that.
undefined says thanks, i'll try
undefined says Hey all! This is Wen Hau from AltLayer, We're providing Rollup-as-a-service infrastructure for anyone that would like to launch an Arbitrum Orbit L3s! If anyone wants to remove the burden of hosting yourself, Feel free to reach out to us! Would be happy to help. TG @engwenhau
undefined says What is the relative cost for posting the batch to the L1? What from my batch posted to the L2 actually makes it to the L1
undefined says If you're running an orbit chain as a rollup on top of arbitrum one your batches get posted to arbitrum one and then the full tx data is posted from there back to ethereum. Generally speaking the postings costs will be similar to using Arbitrum One, but if you want to you can configure the base fee to be arbitrarily low so the execution fees can be much lower. Picking out an example tx from arbiscan https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xef8ea301b69d13b32242961b6efd69cce7494473e77e6636c5d8245636385704#txninfo, you can see the L2 gas used was about half of the L1 gas used so you can approximate how much you might be able to save from moving to a orbit rollup chain. If you wanted to use an anytrust chain, either arbitrum nova or an anytrust orbit chain on top of Arbitrum one, you could save significant more costs because that would cut out the batch posting fee
undefined says Thank you ser
undefined says why can't I vote I have tokens for arbitrators then I've always voted for this?
undefined says Please take this issue to our #📬︱support channel
undefined says How can I deploy Orbit Chain on the Arbitrum mainnet? It seems that it currently only supports Goerli and Sepolia (testnet) when using https://orbit.arbitrum.io/deployment.
undefined says Hey guys, I'm having an issue
undefined says When I get to this page I click deploy and it processes for a while and each time nothing happens, the deploy button comes up again
undefined says Also, as mentioned by @yyy20119, how do we deploy on main net? Is there any code implemation instructions anywhere? I haven't seen any yet
undefined says @Luke-1000 Did you talk to the admin yet or opened a ticket support to get help?
undefined says I haven't no, is that better to do than here?
undefined says Thanks for the speedy response @Kendrell4eth
undefined says Be very carefull with messages from people that aren't from the team.
undefined says Oh ok thank you
undefined says Are you able to help with my issue at all
undefined says At that point you should be prompted to sign a transaction. Are you sure you don't have a signing prompt in your wallet? If not, what wallet did you use to connect
undefined says There's currently no actively provided guidance on mainnet usage though Caldera, a company running rollups as a service, recently announced that they're planning on launching multiple mainnet orbit chains soon https://blog.caldera.xyz/unveiling-our-first-set-of-arbitrum-orbit-chains/
undefined says I want to do an orbit chain
undefined says who can tell me work of this rpc ?
undefined says 
undefined says I created a obrbit chain  with  orbit-setup-script , but it only  produced 27 blocks and soon blocked with this error
undefined says Ah my browser was blocking it. Solved, thanks
undefined says Thanks for this. What about a testnet?
undefined says Awesome! Re: testnet that's basically already the result of running through the deployment tool
undefined says True and understood!
undefined says Do you have any reccomended resources of starting points for deploying contracts to the testnet chain
undefined says Looks like the chain is running successfully. Those were just some warnings emitted while it was booting. Blocks are only produced if you send transactions, but if you do you should see new blocks produced
undefined says And thanks again Harry
undefined says No prob! If you run this step https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart#step-11-finish-setting-up-your-chain it should trigger a deposit that will fund your account on the orbit chain by depositing through the bridge. Once you have funds in your account you should be able to use any normal deployment tooling, eg. foundry, hardhat, or truffle to deploy on that chain pointing to the RPC interface of the node you're running
undefined says Pretty soon we should have an update out to the deployment tool that will actually let you use the official bridge UI to bridge into your orbit testnet
undefined says Can I deploy the Orbit Chain on Arbitrum One (mainnet) by modifying this repository: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/orbit-deployment-ui?
undefined says hey guys are we allowed to add our own Layer 3 chains to the SubGraph so they work with the arbitrum testnet bridge?
undefined says api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/gvladika/layer2-token-gateway-goerli
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-subgraphs
undefined says There's currently no active guidance around deploying orbit chains on mainnet
undefined says You can't add arbitrary chains to the hosted token bridge interface currently though the UI is open source so you could run it yourself. Note also, that it can work without the subraphs by failling back onto direct RPC calls if desired though there could be performance issues
undefined says Hey guys can orbit use ens?
undefined says when i run "docker-compose  logs -f nitro   " , i  found  ther error " couldn't read L1 chainid ", so why?
undefined says 
undefined says who can give some suggestion?
undefined says As it throw 403 error, so please check your l2 node's rpc, might be something wrong with that
undefined says 
undefined says run "docker-compose up -d", the  nitro can't run
undefined says and i have a question:  when i run this script, and the nitro run in docker with our L3?
undefined says This error thrown from your l2 node (l1 chain id here in orbit is actually l2 chain id), so please check your l2 rpc url
undefined says Your l3's code base is nitro
undefined says so nitro code  can run L2 and L3,  just depending on our config
undefined says Yup, orbit use the nitro codebase
undefined says You can find that url at nodeConfig.json, it is parent-chain.connect.url
undefined says ok
undefined says i use this rpc
undefined says 
undefined says How about trying 3rd party rpc? like alchemy or infura
undefined says ok. I try it afternoon,lunch first. 3Q
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs   I selected on rpc from chainlist and restart docker-compose, then get new error " error posting batch"
undefined says 
undefined says But from the error content, your url is still the public rpc, you can try get one from infura or alchemy
undefined says Is your ip address has a lot request to our public rpc?
undefined says i want to make some test on orbit, so the request maybe more than usual
undefined says Do you have some control with frequent address ?
undefined says The public rpc has some limits for the request number, but 3rd party rpc will be higher.
undefined says 3rd party rpc should not be free?
undefined says They have free plan
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.io/projects?chains=arbitrum-one_arbitrum-nova&subcategories=node-provider
undefined says ok , i check it and find one to try
undefined says those rpc only support main network?
undefined says Alchemy or infura support arb-goerli
undefined says i register one, but find olny mainnet api key created
undefined says like this
undefined says You can go to your dashboard, and click create  new app, then select like this:
undefined says otherwise, how many TPS reach with orbit?
undefined says In theory, the mini block time is 0.25s and 32 m gas limit per block, but it depends on your machine's hardware finally.
undefined says so  how many transactions can be processed in one second?
undefined says I want to deploy an orbit specifically to serve my app. I want to know the highest tps it can achieve.
undefined says Because my game is high-frequency trading, it has higher TPS requirements.
undefined says It depends on your hardware performance, and each tx will cost different gas, also those parameter (0.25s block time and 32m block limit) can be manually reset, so it hard to give you the number, but you can test it on your server directly.
undefined says Do you know how much gas your game will cost per tx?
undefined says The game is still under development, so I'm not sure yet.
undefined says Also if your game is high-frequency trading, you can try our stylus, it can allow you to use rust for contracts, it will be more faster and cheaper so you can have higher tx processed at the same time. https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-quickstart
undefined says I have never come across a stylus. I need to learn more about it first. If the stylus is more suitable for high-frequency trading, I can switch to it.
undefined says We also have docs about the stylus gas: https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas#stylus-gas-costs
undefined says ok
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 
I took a cursory look at the stylus documentation, and it feels like an extension of the wasm program has been added to nitro, so do you suggest that I use wasm to write our game program to obtain higher performance and low gas?
undefined says Yes, use stylus for better, but for now, we haven't supported stylus in orbit, but should not take long.
undefined says When will stylus mainnet be launched? Are you ready to open source it? If it is open source, can I use stylus to deploy L3 like I use Nitro now?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  I use the 3rd rpc (alchemy), and reset my docker, this question also exist
undefined says We already open source stylus https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus, but we don't have eta for mainnet since we need dao to approve.
undefined says Is it also 403 forbidden?
undefined says yes
undefined says Could you give me a screenshot?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Can you check the log line `2023-09-20 17:29:15 INFO [09-20|09:29:15.765] connected to l1 chain ` and see which the url is (it has l1url= info)? Because I still see our public rpc from your screenshot.
undefined says 
undefined says error changed, maybe i modify the rpc
undefined says From this screenshot, it doesn't say any non-200 rpc response
undefined says Also from this screenshot, I can see goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io which is our public rpc url.
undefined says 
undefined says i  modify rpc here, is any other place need to modify too?
undefined says So can you have a check on this line? It is in front of the log content
undefined says i  got, two place need to modify
undefined says 
undefined says Oh, can you see this request in your alchemy dashboard?
undefined says 
undefined says I solved this question, now the node run well
undefined says May I ask which issue you found?
undefined says first,  in nodeConfig.json  file, two place need to modify rpc
undefined says second ,  my alchemy config error,  i add  a address to allowlist, actually,  i should not add address in here, because it's whitelist
undefined says 
undefined says Oh, I see, I thought you use rollups l3
undefined says actully, i want to use rollups l3
undefined says so i provided a L1 rpc to replace  "https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc", so i took a mistake?
undefined says https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc is  a rpc of your Nitro?
undefined says Yeap, that's the URL of the public Arb Goerli's RPC. Was your issue resolved?
undefined says Arbitrum Goerli is  L1 chain,  Nitro is L2 chain,  orbit is L3 chain.  In nodeConfig.json, thie   parent-chain-node-url  seems to be a  rpc  of L2?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Because from your node config file, it has data-availability field, which is used for anytrust, it seems you click anytrust when you create l3 on our portal:
undefined says I soloved this question
undefined says Actually, Arbitrum Goerli is l2 chain, orbit is used for l3 chain, and nitro is the technology stack name. Your logs show Arbitrum Goerli is l1 chain is because you are running l3 network, which the l2 compare to l3 is just like it is l1 compare to l2.
undefined says Now my chain run ok
undefined says Goerli is  L1 chain, Arbitrum Goerli   is L2 chain,  orbit is L3 chain.  I get it
undefined says any ETA on being able to verify smart contracts on Blockscout on my orbit chain? I need to listen to emitted events from my smart contract
undefined says Any issue whenyou try to verify your contract?
undefined says Is it internal server error? If so, you might not set `SECRET_KEY_BASE` . You can use mix phx.gen.secret to gen one, then go to the `docker-compose.yaml` file and set it under blockscout.environment
undefined says yes its an internal server error message. OK thanks for that info I'll try that later. For now I have a new error, I'm building a fresh new orbit chain on a new VPS and everything works fine for a minute and then I get a fatal error that stops the blockchain, not sure if it's a problem with the server or the chain, here's the screenshot:
undefined says err="accept tcp4 127.0.0.1:34463: i/o timeout"
undefined says I've had this running on a VPS without this problem but now I get this
undefined says Do you set your l1 rpc manually?
undefined says I do `docker-compose up -d` and then I do `PRIVATE_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" L2_RPC_URL="https://arb-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxxxxxxxxxxx" L3_RPC_URL="http://xx.xx.xxx.x:8449" yarn run setup` I'm using a private alchemy RPC endpoint for Arbitrum Goerli
undefined says and in docker-compose.yaml I had to change `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` but I did that before and it worked on a VPS so I don't think thats the problem
undefined says the block explorer is working and online, and the l3 RPC endpoint is also working:
curl http://xx.xx.xxx.x:8449 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'

returns this:
`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x2d"}`
undefined says but each time its the same error but on a different port:
 `err="accept tcp4 127.0.0.1:46831: i/o timeout"`
undefined says What is B is this formula of gas F = exp(-a(B-b))
and what's the actually value of a and b
undefined says I cloned my VPS to another machine in another location and still had the same problem. So I created a fresh new VPS using Ubuntu 23.04 instead of 22.04 and I did the entire setup process through a non-root account using sudo and that worked, the chain is working perfectly now 🙂
undefined says so I dont know what the problem was but whatever, just had to spend 24 hours building and rebuilding VPS machines 🙂
undefined says You can see from our code about this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbos/l2pricing/model.go#L38
undefined says everything is working fine and transactions going through no problem but getting this message appear in the logs:
`nitro_1       | INFO [09-22|05:34:05.887] not posting more messages because block number or timestamp exceed L1 bounds blockNumber=9,737,851  l1BoundMaxBlockNumber=9,737,843 timestamp=1,695,360,823 l1BoundMaxTimestamp=1,695,363,638`
undefined says it appears every 10 seconds and a transaction will stop it, but then another transaction will start the messages again every 10 seconds
undefined says yes adding `SECRET_KEY_BASE` fixed the internal server error message, I just successfully verified my smart contract. I had to flatten it first with solidity-flattener
undefined says This is normal, it is not error
undefined says any tips on how to get https working on the RPC endpoint and the block explorer? I've installed nginx on the server and trying different things but can't get it working. They work fine over http
undefined says using Certbot certificate
undefined says can anyone provide original orbiter testnet link

undefined says Thanks for sending. Will DM you
undefined says really thanks,  and when will it be approved?
undefined says Should be within a day or so.
undefined says Welp, every dev supposed to get couple of weeks so delayed by another couple of weeks now rip
undefined says How can we contact the project party
undefined says We want to deploy here
undefined says Hi guys, where can I faucet ETH (Or Native Token) on "Rinkeby" of Arbitrum chain
undefined says You bridge rinkeby eth over
undefined says There are multiple rinkeby faucets
undefined says I'm trying a simple MetaMask ETH transfer with suggested gas prices (0,2666 gwei) on https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc (i'm whitelisted) and getting back '[ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{"value":{"code":-32603,"data":{"code":-32000,"message":"execution reverted: error code InsufficientGasForBaseFee"}}}''. --- is it somehow related to requiring EIP-1559 style transactions?
undefined says My guess is that you are hitting the MM issue where they hardcode eTH transfers at 21,000 gas. from our public docs: In order to do a ETH transfer through Metamask, you must manually enter a higher gas limit than the default 21,000 gas. 800,000 should work well
undefined says Hi, is it possible for smart contracts deployed to Arbitrum to read data from contracts on ETH Mainnet?
undefined says hello , a simple question . will arbitrum allow third party to run arbitrum node
undefined says is there txpool of l2 tx?
undefined says ah - thank you, that makes sense - and for others, that was indeed the problem
undefined says I read that the main addresses of uniswap will be the same once bridged, how do you guys manage to do this?
undefined says https://twitter.com/uniswap/status/1400847744596598792?s=21
undefined says "Arbitrum contract address generation works just like Ethereum. If you'd like to have your contracts deployed at the same addresses as on Ethereum then make sure you're using the same deployment address and nonce as when you deployed on Ethereum. "
undefined says Hi guys,
I am reading this document: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/contract_deployment
wondering anyone tried solidity smart contract mainnet deployment
undefined says @abe_from_cap
undefined says Yes, you need to be whitelisted for now.
undefined says How do we get whitelisted? Is it too late?
undefined says Fill out the form linked at the end of the blogpost and we can get you up and running!
undefined says Can we see the 250 shortlisted dapps list for dev-mainnet somewhere?
undefined says Hey everyone,
Only way to bridge an arbitrum native ERC20 (minted and burnt on arbitrum) to mainnet is to design a custom gateway right?

We are a protocol that will mint/burn our token on arbitrum itself with an option for users to move the token to mainnet
I think there will be other protocols like us as well

Should we make one custom gateway that all arbitrum native tokens use (just like most mainnet tokens are going to use the ERC20Gateway)

Is anyone working on it already?
undefined says we have a sort of "generic custom gateway" implemented. This should work for most use-cases: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ERC20Gateway.sol
undefined says This does not work in the case when the token is minted/burnt on arbitrum right? 
That's the case I am talking about above
undefined says Is it possible for a third party to send tokens to the Arbitrum token bridge and have another party send separate instructions where to credit/mint the token on Arbitrum net? For example many Fiat>crypto gateways exist without Arbitrum support, so if you could supply the Ethereum bridge contract address when sending the funds but send instructions from another account then it saves the extra gas than just having a forwarder contract built in the middle.
undefined says i think for your case, making a new custom gateway is likely the better route
undefined says Hi, Hunter
Could you please let me know if I can apply for that. 
If I can, could you please let me know how. Thanks
undefined says Read this article and there's a form to complete for whitelisting https://offchain.medium.com/introducing-arbitrum-one-our-mainet-beta-ed0e9b63b435

undefined says Hey do we need to be on a waiting list to build apps on Arbitrum One before it launches public?
undefined says If your app works on testnet, which is open to all, then things should work on release. There is no waiting list for the apps we’ve approved from the forms
undefined says This article has a link to a form to fill out for access to developer mainnet
https://medium.com/offchainlabs/wen-arbitrum-634969c14713
undefined says Hello 🙂  Where can I find AAVE (or AARBE) contract addresses deployed on Arbitrum One?  Is there such a thing?  Thank you 🙂
undefined says the same error, have you fix it ?
undefined says Hey guys, we're interested in running the next round of clr.fund on Arbitrum.
I've already filled out the form for dev access, how long does it typically take to get a response on that?
If we are given access and deploy, will user be able to interact with it right away?
undefined says does anyone know if there's any progress with the makerdao arbitrum audits?
undefined says Hi Auryn - saw that you have requested access and will send you instructions shortly! Regarding end-users, we are still in a developer only stage so unfortunately users won't be able to interact with it right away.
undefined says Hi,
Anyone tried transfer Arbitrum L2 ETH?
It looks like it always failed.
undefined says It seems it should work using the IMtoken wallet. I tried MetaMask, it failed.
https://token.im/blog/en-us/articles/4402915335193-What-is-Arbitrum-and-how-to-use-it-in-imToken
undefined says I just noticed it works if I set the `gas limit` manually[MetaMask].
undefined says Trying to deploy, going straight to mainnet as the testnet RPC endpoint seems to have fallen over. Is there any way to know:
1) What gas limit I should set
2) What gas price I should set
undefined says you can run locally to test as well It's hard to predict what the gasLimit and gasPrices should be set to. if you don't fill them in, arb-ts should call automatically estimate the gas through the arbRetryable precompile
undefined says So infura isn't supporting websockets at the moment. Is Off Chain Labs going to continue support for the websocket endpoint, and is this dependable in production? (haven't had a problem with it lately)
undefined says this was the problem: "My guess is that you are hitting the MM issue where they hardcode eTH transfers at 21,000 gas. from our public docs: In order to do a ETH transfer through Metamask, you must manually enter a higher gas limit than the default 21,000 gas. 800,000 should work well"
undefined says when in doubt, gas it out
undefined says I want a currency contract Arbitrum
undefined says Thanks, so it turned out the problem was that I was setting the gas *limit*, I just needed to stop doing that and let the node estimate it. I didn't expect that because the error message it gave me was about the base fee so I was thinking about the gas *price*, but just taking the setting out and trusting in the gods made the deployment work.
undefined says Great to hear! The base fee is the cost of storing a retryable in the retry buffer on l2. The total cost of your tx will be base fee (also known as maxSubmissionCost) + callValue + maxGas * gasPrice (cost of execution). If the total cost < base fee, the tx automatically reverts
undefined says Hi, I’m trying to understand the economics of Arbitrum. 

When I pay a tx fee on L2 how is the fee split between aggregators, validators & l1 miners? Are there any other participants that get a portion of this fee?

Also, do you have a list of all Artbirum mainnet smart contract addresses?
undefined says this is a good resource: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#prices-for-l2-tx-and-l1-calldata
undefined says Thanks that was very helpful. Here is my current understanding, does this seem correct?

The tx fee consists of: 

L2 base price + cost of calldata on l2 + 15% markup on the previous fees + cost of storage & computation.

L2 base price + cost to submit to l1 goes to aggregator if there is one (otherwise straight to Ethereum miners). ArbOS collects the 15% fee.

Then l2 base price + cost to submit to l1  goes to l1 Ethereum miners.

Does the storage & computation fee go to the “active validator” currently run by Offchain Labs?
undefined says Also how are aggregators incentiviced?
undefined says yes i think your understanding is correct
undefined says the aggregators are incentivized by the fees. The storage and computation costs are covered by the 15% markup
undefined says Which part of the tx fee goes to the aggregators?
undefined says base fees for L2 tx and L1 calldata
undefined says Hmm, but aren't those used to publish the tx on l1?
undefined says yea so aggregators only get paid if a user switches from the sequencer to their preferred aggregator. The aggregators get paid pretty much just the l1 cost (it's more of a backup mechanism than something we want to incentivize).
undefined says If user switches to an aggregator does the sequencer still get the storage/computation fee?
undefined says I think was wrong when I answered your question before. The preferred aggregator does get fees from the user. It's the base fee (set by the aggregator per tx  + the l1 calldata cost)
undefined says Okay, and this should be approx the same amount it costs the aggregator to publish the tx on l1?
undefined says it could be - the base fee is set by the aggregator
undefined says In the doc it says that it comes from this formula. What I'm missing here?
undefined says yes this is the correct formula for how much the aggregator is reimbursed
undefined says Okay, thanks a lot! 

Which are the smart contracts I should look at if I’m interested to track the flow of:
1. Base fee + call data fee
2. 15% fee to ArbOS
3. Storage & computation fee
undefined says It's all managed under the hood in ArbOs. the estimateGas method can be found in the arbsys precompile
undefined says Hey! What's the chainId for the mainnet?
undefined says Working to add it in `Web3Modal` !
undefined says Will it conitnue to be `42161` after the beta is removed?
undefined says Will you have token?
undefined says No token here! Only $ETH
undefined says How can we use this? Is it a contract function or just in arb-ts?
undefined says you can access estimateGas through the provider. You can get the base submission cost through the arbRetryableTx
undefined says Are you implying we can use the `estimateRetryableTicket()` function to estimate the gas cost of a typical transaction executed directly on Arbitrum?
undefined says well it's dependent on the l1 gas price but you can get an estimate of the tx cost
undefined says Actually, that's on the NodeInterface, not the arbRetryableTx
undefined says Okay, so yeah basically, there isn't another function I'm missing called `estimateGas()` or similar?
undefined says Fine if it is, just wanna clarify
undefined says yea there's a getGasPrice method exposed in the  l2 bridge. But estimateRetryableTicket returns an estimate of the gas needed
undefined says Why is every transaction in a separate "block"? Even transactions that seem to happen at the same timestamp? Can multiple transactions ever be in the same block?
undefined says I only ask as it's quite expensive to deploy to at the moment but assume costs will drop once there is wider usage.
undefined says it's theoretically possible for a block to contain multiple txs. Under normal load, the sequencer chooses to put txs into their own block. Under heavy load, it will place multiple txs into a single block
undefined says And will cost decrease under heavier load? Up to a point.
undefined says the cost per tx would decrease slightly
undefined says Yes this is the stable chainid
undefined says Hi! Just curious, do we have an estimated gas cost of passing tokens through the bridge?
undefined says How long does it take to get funds off Arbitrum back onto Eth?
undefined says the dispute period is 7 days .
undefined says Thanks
undefined says hi folks, just dipping in here as we begin the build of a proof of concept 🙂 - we'll be focused on a few erc20s initially, but I wonder if anyone has experimented with erc1155 - I haven't seen any docs or examples (or chat really) at this stage 🙂
undefined says and on a related note, I wonder if anyone from https://bosonprotocol.io/ has popped in here?
undefined says and also out of curiosity - I wonder what timezones folks in here are on - I'm locked down here in Sydney, where's it's a fresh, sunny, winter morning
undefined says Hi, I want to try the bridge, can anyone please approve my following address?
0x55d94c9D62725c89E0571067b8379F058c8C62D6
undefined says Can anyone tell me where I can find those specific list addresses from where the weighted average is calculated?
undefined says The dev main net has a whitelisting profess. If you want to test the bridge I’d recommend using the rinkeby testnet
undefined says is the bridge required or can dapps build it into the page themselves
undefined says FYI
As a wallet developer, we are testing two rpc services for arbitrum one mainnet, ARB1 'https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc' and ALCHEMY 'https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2'.
Now the two provide gas limits, 696862 (ARB1) and 98949 (ALCHEMY) respectively for pure ETH transfer.  ARB1's suggest is correct.
When I use 98949, tx is reverted with 'InsufficientGasForBaseFee' error.
undefined says Hey Guys, I was playing around with Rinkeby testnet and did some transactions, and I tried withdrawing ETH from L2 to L1 and now it;s in "challenge period", is there a way I can initiate a challenge to dispute this transaction?
https://rinkeby-explorer.arbitrum.io/tx/0x865cceb8ebaf46854fffd13f444fa36110127006d2ad870e43050817da50c199
undefined says FYI - TX fee comparison (30th Jul 2021)

[Arbitrum One Mainnet]
ETH transfer:  0.000108180745053337 eth ($0.25)
Write tx (to a sample contract):  0.000196156851917319 eth ($0.45)

[Optimistic Mainnet]
ETH transfer:  0.000342300375 Ether ($0.79)
Uniswap swap:  0.00042045351 Ether ($0.97)
Token(DAI) transfer:  0.000336150315 Ether ($0.78)
undefined says Considering early stage of fee optimization, I think it's a good start..
undefined says Hey - we are looking into this. Thanks for flagging!
undefined says @Rahul Maganti 
Is there an online explorer or website to give us insights into the number of nodes / validators / aggregators / sequencers currently running on mainnet or on the Rink Arby testnet?
undefined says Not atm. There is one sequencer as of now.
undefined says @Rahul Maganti 
What about the number of non-sequencer validators as of now?
undefined says is main down?
undefined says cant bridge for testnet
undefined says what is inboxMaxCount in the NodeCreated code?
undefined says rpc settings please?
undefined says for L2 Alpha
undefined says See https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet
undefined says this rinkeby testnet have too many issues, first it was down. now deploying a contract to the cluster through hardhat returns a connection refused error
undefined says Hi team, I was trying to withdraw from the Bridge (bridge.arbitrum.io), it has past the dispute waiting period however I still do not see the funds back on Ethereum mainnet. I have this unconfirmed status. Please help 🙂
undefined says Getting lots of timed out errors when trying to deploy contracts. Is this common?
undefined says you could try getting an RPC URL from https://www.alchemy.com/, it has worked well for me so far, it is free if you are not using it for too many requests
undefined says cheers
undefined says I get this on alchemy: `ProviderError: execution reverted: error code InsufficientGasForBaseFee`
And on infura: `ProviderError: project ID does not have access to arbitrum l2`
undefined says On `https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc` it works but I sometimes get timeout errors
undefined says hi,  anyone plz take a look at this issue ?  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/issues/1414
undefined says depositETH to inbox failed
undefined says probably need to set a higher gas limit for your transaction
undefined says Cool!  thanks!
undefined says is  69c58d6b33c4dfb7d8293ccfdcb1675798201b7e this a relatively stable version? which comes from https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet#rinkeby-deployment, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/69c58d6b33c4dfb7d8293ccfdcb1675798201b7e/packages/arb-rpc-node/cmd/arb-node/arb-node.go#L130 should  fs.NArg  be 3?
undefined says Hi could the tech team provide some insight to this issue?
undefined says Hi,
In the https://offchain.medium.com/arbitrum-updates-standing-up-an-ecosystem-7666260a734b update, it mentions "core infrastructure dependencies are in place and popular tokens are bridged"

Which components come under the "core infrastructure dependencies" referred to here?
undefined says did you execute the tx on l1?
undefined says Hi Rahul I executed the tx on Arbitrum 1's side
undefined says hmm that's odd -- how long has it been pending like this?
undefined says It has been more than a day now
undefined says Says "Unconfirmed: ETA: any minute!"
undefined says @Rahul Maganti 
Hey, to bridge erc20 from Arbitrum, I need to use L2GatewayRouter.outboundTransfer right?
undefined says can you just make sure executeTransaction didn't revert?
undefined says yep
undefined says Parms are:
L1token address,
_to address,
_amount,
_data
undefined says What should I input in the data parm?
undefined says Hi Rahul yes there is no indication that transaction is reverted
undefined says 
undefined says it might be possible it's just taking longer on the Ethereum. Hard to tell from this
undefined says Can I share my transaction with you?
undefined says @Rahul Maganti  can you please tell me what is the data field?
undefined says What is the input
undefined says its just calldata. you can provide any additional info, (gaslimit, etc...)
undefined says Ok thanks Rahul, just making sure, the l1 token address is the token address on Layer 1? 
Somehow there’s problem with the contract interaction
undefined says yea it should be
undefined says quick question,
undefined says what is the average block time on arbitrum?
undefined says is it faster than solana(400ms)?
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs
undefined says @Rahul Maganti
undefined says Hey I got a email for being whitelisted and gave my addresses. I got a reply saying they got whitelisted and some account funded, however it’s actually still counted as not whitelisted when using the bridge or deploying contracts through either of the 2 addresses I gave.
undefined says Should I wait or is that not normal
undefined says There isn't the same notion of blocks on Arbitrum as the sequencer processes transactions
undefined says then, what kind of performance factors do you have?
undefined says Not normal - let us look into whether you were whitelisted on the bridge or accidentally it didn't go through on the bridge. Deploying contracts should work. What is the error message you are receiving and @Rahul Maganti can help. Thanks!
undefined says I’ll pull up the error when attempting a transfer between the 2 wallets that are whitelisted and deploying on something like remix
undefined says tx fee is usually a good one
undefined says but the transactions should be appeared after block is confirmed right? you mentioned the sequencer, and it will be real-time? the transation will be confirmed immediately?
undefined says Internal JSON-RPC error. { "code": -32000, "message": "failed to execute call with revert code 13" } when using remix to deploy 

and 

{ "code": -32603, "data":{"code": -32000, "message": "forbidden sender address" } when using the bridge or similar
undefined says bridge here https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ returns this https://i.imgur.com/hr02hbH.png
undefined says once the sequencer publishes a tx on-chain, it's secured but the sequencer itself can also provide some trusted off-chain confirmation
undefined says so that's my question, how long will it take a sequencer to publish a tx. and how many transactions can a sequencer publish within a sec
undefined says what is the address you're using?
undefined says 0x2E5d207a4C0F7e7C52F6622DCC6EB44bC0fE1A13

And 

0xbD63533aBbab74e5C4Da3d159708A5f1879598D5
undefined says im looking into it
undefined says it depends on demand
undefined says thanks 🙏 we're trying to get our stuff deployed on the mainnet today :kannaDetective:
undefined says Check now to see if it works!
undefined says activity heating up 🙂 - great to see! - we're also keen to start experimenting and building on mainnet 🙂
undefined says works perfectly
undefined says any uniswap v2 like AMM's that have deployed on the mainnet?
undefined says I believe both Sushi and Swapr by DXDao may be based on Uni v2. There may be others but cannot remember off the top of my head. Glad to hear things are working now!!
undefined says noted thanks for the heads up
undefined says Hi @Rahul Maganti could you help, the transaction to withdraw from Arbitrum One is completed but no Ethereum on Mainnet is visible! Pls help 🙏 https://explorer.arbitrum.io/tx/0x3e29313b3b0b49d6c3bea9ab084680a54afeb6f5ebd8326261629f9cc03247b2
undefined says if anyone else is releasing a dex on Arbitrum pm me 👀
undefined says looking into it -- will get back to you
undefined says @Rahul Maganti In Outbox.executeTransaction on L1, what is the L1 Block parameter?
undefined says the l1 block number at which the transaction is sent to l 1
undefined says @Rahul Maganti  What is the easiest way to get that block number? Which address should I monitor?
undefined says And when does that happen? Let’s say I call L2GatewayRouter.outboundTransfer right now, when it get send to l1? And from who?
undefined says we can have a convenience method in the bridge that handles this for you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/c04ef962e6f859cc7deacd1410cfdf03c8e63e6f/packages/arb-ts/src/lib/bridge.ts#L485..
undefined says hi, guys, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/f1af4979441429555da2bf7b4e1fb515e7415df2/packages/arb-ts/scripts/instantiate_bridge.ts#L52   Except those methods, Can I initialize bridge by metamask and How?  Thanks
undefined says you can access the bridge here: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Cool! I'll check it, thanks
undefined says ye np!
undefined says If you are running your own full node, does it keep up with the state of the sequencer or it can only get the state that is finalized?
undefined says The sequencer provides a feed to provide nodes with a real time state
undefined says Is it possible to access the dev mainnet yet? Can I use it? Or is it permissioned for now?
undefined says when mainnet
undefined says within this month
undefined says https://offchain.medium.com/a-is-for-arbitrum-a-is-for-august-71391582d95b
undefined says airdrop?
undefined says no
undefined says i like Ethereum and developer. maybe ıi will be a part of eth developer. there are a lot of things to learn
undefined says thx
undefined says The current dev mainnet has a whitelist process but mainnet will be released to user by the end of this month! See #📢︱announcements for the medium post
undefined says Does it broadcast the transaction it receives?
undefined says hey @Rahul Maganti  any a guidance on where we can get some info around chainlink on arbitrum one?
undefined says what kind of info?
undefined says interested to know what oracles will be available at launch, or thereafer rollout plan!!
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs will get back to you soon abt this!
undefined says 🙏 i think ive chased him already!!
undefined says hello guys,  what do you think of the performance of arbitrum one?
undefined says hi, someone follow the https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/demo-dapp-pet-shop tutorial? 
i dont understand "DEVNET_PRIVKEY" and i had been test infura.io API and etherscan.io API, still fail
undefined says this is your private key to sign txs
undefined says done! thanks
undefined says sure np!
undefined says you can use etherjs + infura
undefined says yep they should -- one thing to keep in mind is that arbgas works at a different scale than ethereum (800,000 for a gas limit is good)
undefined says Hi, If my address is whitelisted, that means I can use it to send transactions and deploy contracts, but not any other address, right?
undefined says Does anyone know the address for Chainlink and Uniswap V2 on Arbitrum Mainnet?
undefined says @bear - most Arbitrum deployments are to the same contract addesses as the L1s - I'm only working with Uniswap v3 tho....
undefined says Here are the docs: https://docs.chain.link/docs/arbitrum-price-feeds/
undefined says How does `lookupMessageBatchProof` (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#l2-to-l1-messages-lifecycle) work at the source code level? I found it's a virtual-machine intrinsic function presented at 0xC8, but no idea where the definition is.  Thanks.
undefined says L2 -> L1 messages are stored in an outbox entry as a merkle tree. To look up a particular message, you need the batch id + the index of the message in the batch and the associated proof of inclusion. Node interface isn't a real contract but the code that interacts with the interface is here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/8b5f50f96a94be87f65be28e54ef88b7bd87455a/packages/arb-rpc-node/web3/nodeInterface.go#L62
undefined says Thanks @Rahul Maganti
undefined says hey I don't understand how dev mainnet works. I have a defi project I want to launch, how do I test it until launch, and can "users" not access arbitrum one until launch date? Is there a whitelisted bridge or something?
undefined says I didn't figure it oute from https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says I guess I am asking for link to documentation on migration from dev mainnet whitelisted for projects to public mainnet
undefined says ope
undefined says https://offchain.medium.com/a-is-for-arbitrum-a-is-for-august-71391582d95b
undefined says ?
undefined says Do I need to apply to put my project on at this point?
undefined says Promise it isn't a safemoon shitcoin but don't want to spam anything about it either
undefined says when we open to users you won't have to apply
undefined says So I just need to wait? Or can I still apply
undefined says We have a mainnet beta open rn - we can get you whitelisted
undefined says Submitted thru https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4z90e6qDezkkx3fKcULNjrxZ3B1Ib5wJ1Av4vCdbt1JNu2Q/formResponse if that is what I needed to do
undefined says yea let me just make sure this is the right one -- there's a few that have been floating around
undefined says hello! does https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ works for mainnet? I'm trying to move some fund from ETH mainnet to ARB mainnet. But it looks like it only proceed with whitelisted address.
undefined says We have a whitelisting process right now for mainnet. You can use the form linked above to submit a request. We are also opening up to users by the end of month!
undefined says Hi guys! any update in archival node support?
undefined says The endpoint doesn’t support abitrary log queries if that’s what you’re asking
undefined says Optimism's gateway has some severe time and L1 gas barriers.  This friction forces Optimism's gateway to be used only occasionally for bulk transfers.  Once your funds are in, you can enjoy lower fees, but it is a pain to move your funds in and out.  What does the bridge picture look like for Arbitrum, from a single wallet and user perspective?  What will the friction of Arbitrum's gateway look like?
undefined says this is a good reference for how the bridge works and messaging b/t l1 and l2 in arbitrum: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says Hi, I want to test the streaming capabilities of Alchemy on Arbitrum. Does anyone know of a large contract/project on the arbitrum mainnet that would constantly have events (e.g: swaps on uniswap/sushiswap)?
undefined says uniswap should be on there
undefined says oo I see, I was reading another post on this discord where they mentioned that the addresses on arbitrum should be similar to the one found on mainnet. So I was trying to find this pool: https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8

on uniswap-v3 mainnet on arbitrum, but wasn't able to find it on the explorer.
undefined says hmmm - addresses don't necessarily have to be the same. not sure if this pool is supported...might be good to ask uniswap abt this
undefined says oh I see, kk I'll see if I can find an active pool address on their discord. Thanks
undefined says sure, np
undefined says Hi! Wanted to ask, whether the Chainlink VRF is coming to eth mainnet soon? Working on an NFT game project and would good to know if it’s worth waiting 🙂
undefined says Hi, will you guys supply central APIs like etherscan/polygonscan for wallet developers to fetch tx history /token Transfers for a certain address?
undefined says we have an explorer: https://explorer.arbitrum.io/
undefined says aha, I known this
undefined says lol I once knew a jackjack. Did you happen to triplicate?
undefined says Chainlink VRF is currently under development. No exact ETA right now.
undefined says @Rahul Maganti  the link to install a node is this: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation but how to run it with a local node is missing, are there any other instructions on a different link?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain this is missing
undefined says i would like to run a node locally and play around with it so that im familiar with it when the official launch happens
undefined says 👀
undefined says I haven't been able to find the chainid anywhere listed publicly yet. Looks like you can request access to Arbitrum mainnet here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4z90e6qDezkkx3fKcULNjrxZ3B1Ib5wJ1Av4vCdbt1JNu2Q/viewform source: <https://medium.com/offchainlabs/wen-arbitrum-634969c14713>
undefined says Hi, how do I get a list of tokens on the arbritm mainnet, such as USDT, USDC WBTC ...
undefined says how do i install a local node for testing? i've followed https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation but can't find the actual binary or how to run the validator after installation. when is https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain coming up? do you have any other descriptive instruction on how to install and run a local node?
undefined says I think they are still working on a local node binary, there was mention of it in the testnet channel
undefined says thanks
undefined says hi, i wonder if txs on Arbitrum in the same block have the same timestamp or not
undefined says any docs on arbitrum RPC, anyhow to interact with their node? fetch blocks, transactions?
undefined says it is the same as Ethereum
undefined says interact as a normal Ethereum node
undefined says thanks, i've managed to get blocks and transactions, but no transaction traces nor pool available? and is it possible to pubsub to something?
undefined says e.g. pubsub to new blocks
undefined says websocket endpoint?
undefined says I don't know if there is websocket endpoint
undefined says but you can pool it by yourselves at least
undefined says Just check with my team, there is websocket and subscribe
undefined says nice, what's the endpoint? polling and follow-up isn't much fun 🙂
undefined says wss://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/ws
undefined says wss://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/ws
undefined says thank you
undefined says Are you trying to deploy something on mainnet?
undefined says it's all good! But yeah you're gonna have to wait then until we do officially launch, sorry :arbjak:
undefined says Is the mainnet chain id not the one listed here? https://offchain.medium.com/introducing-arbitrum-one-our-mainet-beta-ed0e9b63b435
undefined says do you mind me asking how you managed this? do you have a node running? if so, how did you get it to run
undefined says no, i don't see any docs on how to install and setup a local node, i've used their rpc endpoint
undefined says thanks!
undefined says Does the official launch mean that my address does not require authorization to use the token bridge?
undefined says yep no authentication required when we go live 🙂
undefined says Hey all, we (tracer.finance) are looking to get some new contracts deployed in the coming weeks and are wondering if the basefee opcode is supported? some of our contracts have some gas logic that currently uses the opcode so we are trying to scope if we need to tweak the mechanism or not
undefined says Hi! I'm trying to research Arbitrum (as a potential platform to deploy an NFT marketplace to), and would be interested in speaking with someone about it just to get a better understanding of what building a platform on it looks like from a user perspective. Is there someone here who would be willing to chat with me about it?
undefined says From a smart contract perspective, it's much like deploying to L1 mainnet .. possibly a few tweaks.
undefined says Same for a dApp perspective
undefined says Out of interest, what NFT marketplace ... we do need a marketplace on Arbitrum.
undefined says Is this helper the expected way to get a retryable ticket ID based on the L1 messageIndex?

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-ts/src/lib/bridge_helpers.ts#L159
undefined says Hey, can you update the Cap github link from portal.arbitrum.one? Since there is a new version of the protocol, new github is github.com/0xcap
You can check it here blog.cap.finance
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs can help here
undefined says GM Developers on the Arbitrum 1 portal.  Thank you for all your hard work!
undefined says If you are still interesting in setting up your own arbitrum chain you can take a look at the instructions I've prepared: https://hackmd.io/@koal/BkE8tDm-Y
undefined says When will the “unapproved” accounts be able to use the mainnet bridge to Arb1?
undefined says Stay tuned 😌
undefined says Is there any public countdown ser?
undefined says anyone have instructions on how to run an arbitrum node locally? so i can run rpc calls against it?
undefined says The Arbitrum repository has a script for building a docker image, using that is the easiest way afaik

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/scripts/build_node_docker.py
undefined says Then you can run it like this `docker run --name arbitrum -it arb-node --l1.url=http://<eth-rpc>/`
undefined says but this is nothing official, so if it doesn't work there is no money return
undefined says any explanation to the recent code changes to Inbox.sol with the new variable "shouldRewriteSender" that modifies L2 destination address?
undefined says https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/
undefined says thanks, ill take a look at this 🙂
undefined says does the arbitrum bridge support weird erc20 tokens?
undefined says like fee on transfer / rebase
undefined says Can I use HW wallet just same as for ETH mainnet + Ffox
undefined says yes
undefined says u just need to change rpc in metamsk
undefined says So following this: https://hackmd.io/@koal/BkE8tDm-Y what is the chain id for mainnet? is this the correct procedure to build and run a node?
undefined says Hey, this is Owen, a reporter with The Defiant. Is there a place to see which apps deployed with Arbitrum as a part of its whitelist removal?
undefined says Thanks. Bridged a small amount of ETH successfully!
undefined says Seems none of the dapps work. Even uniswap only has ETH / WETh ? Am I missing something? Should I approve erc20 tokens somewhere
undefined says Here to ask similar, seem to be having approval issues with USDT here, tried uniswap, sushi and arbiscan . ex in console https://imgur.com/a/NSwpwei
undefined says You need to add token address under "manage token list"
undefined says Add a zero at the end of your gwei on metamask
undefined says Go to sushiswap- uniswap seems not ready, manage tokens option didnt work me either.
undefined says Gass fees are insanely cheap 🙂
undefined says Hi, is this the current supported token list: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json
undefined says It would be nice to filter the Portal based off of projects that are publicly open/active or not
undefined says Working on that feature!
undefined says awesome, thanks
undefined says Will those who participated in the early test network have air drop tokens？
undefined says Please share address of arbitrum
undefined says Any plans to allow connecting to the bridge UI with WalletConnect and other wallet providers?
undefined says In the pipeline!
undefined says yo how do nodes work on arbitrum
undefined says how  do i run the node
undefined says i try to do one test swap on UniSwap from ETH to USDT
undefined says 
undefined says fees are not so small
undefined says 0.003303 means 11.5$
undefined says uniswap offered me by defaul throse settings for fee:
undefined says 
undefined says is this ok?
undefined says Mehn....$11....is this thing ever going to scale Eth ?
undefined says if you check arbiscan.io you see that the actual gas price is lower. i think they show that as worst case scenario
undefined says actual gwei right now is like 1.1
undefined says swaps are $4.20 which is like 16x cheaper than L1
undefined says is there a mainnet explorer ?
undefined says Is there any dApp live yet on arb? all the project listed on https://portal.arbitrum.one/ i guess are confirmed but when you click on them they ask you to change to the ETH network?
undefined says https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says white page
undefined says sorry https://arbiscan.io/
undefined says oh wow ok, a bit messy
undefined says emm
undefined says estimateGas is too slow for my local node。which version can i build。..
undefined says Where is the estimated gas indicator on the arbiscan.io ?
undefined says I am wondering how the arbGas is estimated. I deploy a contract on the arbitrum, with gas price around 1 Gwei, it costs me 0.1ETH($365) as tx fee....Compared to the Ethereum mainnet, tx fee is the same for ethereum gas price up to 125Gwei.... Why it costs so much??
undefined says whats the contract addy for sushiswap and uniswap on arbitrum?
undefined says guys is there any UI for bridging assets for now?
undefined says link from medium leads to bridge tutorial
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Can we use meta mask and if so anyone have the rpc for arbitrum please?
undefined says Uncan find the rpc info on the bridge page
undefined says Hey guys, does any one know that except: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
do you have any other available node?
Appreciate if anyone can help
undefined says Can't quite work out how to connect to Aave and Maker. Have these not launched yet?
undefined says hi
undefined says anyone has router address for uniswap on arbitrum?
undefined says Does anyone know any multicall contract address on arbitrum mainnet?
undefined says Maybe this? 

0x80C7DD17B01855a6D2347444a0FCC36136a314de
undefined says any way to get some arbeth?
undefined says Sequence multicall works on Arbitrum
https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js/tree/master/packages/multicall

The contract is 0xd130B43062D875a4B7aF3f8fc036Bc6e9D3E1B3E
undefined says hi guys is there any bsc bridge?
undefined says what apps are working?
undefined says anyone doing any farming?
undefined says This is hilarious. can someone explain why all Arbitrum transactions consume **10x more gas** than layer 1?

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc49142ec1a3308cc554e85bfc73ab724c98e68c24d4197006c57eb051770a310
vs
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd2f1bb159c9d6b7954237e5228f0a4cd8de8a2e077d3d1992a0a67674d09bf50
undefined says we were promised low gas
undefined says Arbgas != L1 gas
undefined says But the ETH fees are the same
undefined says it's gas price x gas used = ETH fee
undefined says ETH fees are not same
undefined says Lol
undefined says paying $5-$10 on uniswaps
undefined says this is 2 orders of magnitude worse than things like solana
undefined says 0.00097496183593 ETH ($3.45)
undefined says 0.011112823084809992 Ether ($39.34)
undefined says 10x gain
undefined says And this is with restriction
undefined says Can't see them too.
undefined says same
undefined says Aave needs AMM liquidity to be able to liquidate positions
undefined says Maker doesn't plan to immediately deploy to any L2 either, they'd rather bridge L1 DAI for now
undefined says If I may, DXdao's Swapr is launching a massive ArbitrumOne liquidity mining campaign by come Monday, Sept 6th the latest. 👩‍🌾 👨‍🌾
undefined says anyone added liquidity to uniswap on arbitrum?
undefined says Why fees is so damn high even on L2
undefined says How many Ls do we need to make the fees in cents
undefined says So when we launching Arbitrum L10
undefined says put this in lab-works
undefined says 🙂
undefined says 1eth 900usdt on uniswap?
undefined says is this just low liquidity or no liquidity?
undefined says if it says insufficient then it's probably just low
undefined says if you have usdc just swap for that
undefined says What’s Arbitrum’s symbol? I can’t find it but I keep reading articles about it…
undefined says Can I buy some on Uniswap?
undefined says Or am I teh dumb and this isn’t what I think it is? :SpongeBobPokerFace:
undefined says arbitrum doesn't have it's own token
undefined says That explains things. Okay thank you. How does one invest? Or is it not that sort of thing either?
undefined says Hi, how to setting mainnet RPC
undefined says https://chainlist.org/
undefined says or you can go to bridge.arbitrum.io
undefined says Thanks Bruh!
undefined says you buy eth
undefined says Oh good - im already well invested in this technology then :poop_smile:
undefined says Thanks for the heads up, Zuko
undefined says Is there a list of DApps that are currently on the mainnet?
undefined says we have portal.arbitrum.one that showcase both projects coming soon and ones that are live. But you can also check #🔨︱ecosystem-builder-announcements
undefined says Are chainlink oracles online?
undefined says Much appreciated Hunter!
undefined says Do eth and weth bridge as different tokens on Arbitrum? If so, I assume there's no way to wrap/unwrap once bridged?  Don't want to end up with an illiquid token trapped on Arbitrum for 7 days
undefined says to be safe i'd bridge over actual ETH
undefined says since you need it to transact on arb1
undefined says thanks
undefined says Are there any docs for running a validator on mainnet?
undefined says Preferably using docker
undefined says none currently, but it's on our to-do
undefined says And natively?
undefined says For now I can see only testnets, or i'm looking in the wrong place
undefined says same, on our to-do
undefined says Thanks! please post an announcement
undefined says anyone who got their airdrop?
undefined says Hi, there's no Arbitrum airdrop.
undefined says not the arbitrum, but swpr , using arbitrum bridge
undefined says It seems they're starting the liquidity mining campaign on 6-Sept... perhaps check in their discord.
undefined says cani get their discord?
undefined says Subscription method newPendingTransactions is unsupported on Arbitrum.
any help?
undefined says Transactions get sequenced as soon as they're received so there isn't really a notion of pending transactions at the moment
undefined says thanks, so i do i query for incoming transactions
undefined says pending transactions works on rinkeby however via wss
undefined says `wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws` works, but does it get me all transactions or i am missing any?
undefined says is there an address where fees go to on arbitrum?
undefined says where can we track the fees generated? would be great to add to https://cryptofees.info/
undefined says Hey I'm curious... are all Arbitrum apps fully interoperable?
undefined says It seems that I cannot approve my usdc in l2 and cannot swap by using usdc, anyone knows how to fix this problem?
undefined says I don't think USDC was on their list of supported coins, just USDT
undefined says for now
undefined says USDC should be on the token list
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json
undefined says is this a ws for mainnet ?
undefined says The transfer of USDC to L2 was successful, but I cannot approve it in uniswap😩
undefined says is their a websocket for mainnet yet
undefined says wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws
undefined says check it out
undefined says thanks
undefined says I qualified for the SWPR airdrop, but haven’t tried to claim it on the Arbitrum network yet. Will wait till ETH gas fees are cheaper, but I think some people have been claiming the SWPR on Arbitrum.
undefined says Is Arbitrum interoperable with the pool together proctol?
undefined says If we create token aragon how do we bridge it Arbitrum?
undefined says Is there any aggregator documentation yet? I'm looking to set one up
undefined says Not sure which binary to run after doing the installation instructions
undefined says What will happen to my deployed contracts and created tokens on Arbitrum when EHT2.0 is released? Thanks
undefined says Nothing will change at the merge
undefined says Maybe faster and the fees will be lower than now? Will be any difference with the Eth2.0 L1 ? ...
undefined says There won't be a speed or fee change for consumers with the merge. Block creation time will be significantly more stable and the amount of ether generated to secure the network will be significantly reduced. "Eth2" is a multi-part beast though, and the merge represents only a piece. The final phase of "Eth2" will introduce sharding, increasing the L1 transaction bandwidth and thus reducing the fees (L2s included).
undefined says Then... is safe and appropriate deploy in Arbitrum for a long term web3 project? will have advantages over L1 when all eth2.0 is updated? Or then the L2 projects will be disadvantaged? Thanks
undefined says The scalability of L2 is multiplied by the scalability of L1... so the faster L1 is, the faster L2 is.
undefined says L2s are an enormous part of how Ethereum scales, they aren't going anywhere.
undefined says All right. Thanks
undefined says How to use?
undefined says https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/
undefined says How to run a node on mainnet? seems no instruction in the document
undefined says We haven't released documentation for running your own node yet.  In the meantime, you can use the https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc endpoint, or one of the many 3rd party infrastructure providers like infura or alchemy
undefined says any tips for using aave
undefined says on arbitrum
undefined says It isn't yet live. We will be making it clearer on the portal which apps are live
undefined says Apologies for any confusion on this! Update should be out tomorrow!
undefined says How much time for withdrawing from Arbitrum to mainnet?
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs
undefined says Can I edit gwei accordingly?
undefined says It's a 7 day withdrawal period but there are services for exiting more quickly. An example of this is Celer that is live
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs please this is my last question for today 😅
undefined says The withdrawal period has nothing to do with how much gwei
undefined says No I am not asking for that
Actually I want to swap some token on Arbitrum 
I see that bid gwei is 2.25 and transactions are getting successful at 1.125 gwei 
So can I edit the bid gwei?
undefined says are you seein ghtat on Metamask? I think they are overestimating what the costs are to use Arbitrum rn
undefined says but not 100% sure on that
undefined says Hi AJ is there a guide for setting gas limit and price ?
undefined says Right now metamask gives a default setting was wondering if cos could be lower
undefined says Metamask is estimating $10 per transaction was wondering if it could be cheaper
undefined says From what I've seen the estimate is 2.25 but what is actually paid in fees is somewhere in the region of 1.125.
undefined says Hi, congrats on launching mainnet
undefined says I did a small test today morning and I'm puzzeld by gas used values.

I did exacly same deployment and transaction on Rinkeby and on your mainnet

Rinkeby deployment took 
164,754  GAS
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x666625f42d61da4f5955cf6d76f222f7b16ef1f2809295a331401d9700dcba5a

Arbitrum deployment took
13,795,317 GAS  (83 times more)
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x97ad902464e2a225ce55d69cf39b8d17f35ca8320bc92a044252d20ac41d9e04
undefined says I am stuck with usdc on arbitrum
All my ether is exhausted in gas fees
Is there any way to withdraw usdc from Arbitrum with low gas fees such as 0.0005 eth
undefined says When I submited simple transaction it took 
23,480 GAS on Rinkeby

and 
735,605 on Arbitrum
undefined says I was convinced that SmartContracts on Arbitrum behave axacly the same as on Mainnet is operation gascost different ?
undefined says how does gasleft() behave ?
undefined says Gas on Arbitrum and gas on Rinkeby is not measured the same
undefined says in USD fee terms you can think of Arbitrum as being more or less 1/10 the cost of mainnet
undefined says Have you docs about deply contract in Arbitrum one via Remix ?  Thank you.
undefined says Can I get in ???
undefined says is there a 1155 NFT Gateway (yet)?
undefined says Is metamask overestimating the gas? Or is simple approve really 9 usd?
undefined says Comparing to L1, that fee is about 30%
undefined says what if i have a natural gas well, producing enough for a natural gas generator to generate enough power to run 10,000 TH Bitcoin mining once up and running???  Would you invest?
undefined says Reliable internet also.
undefined says structures and infastructure in general is required
undefined says resources and locations are for sure....
undefined says money is lacking to set it up...
undefined says contact if interested i guess.. goto go...
undefined says gratz on the Launch ! Have to say I am loving the confirmation times - huge UI improvements coming to dapps world !
undefined says Arbitrum and Ethereum have different units of gas accounting. Our Rinkeby explorer would be the best place to look for your Rinkeby deployment not Rinkeby Etherscan (that is Layer 1) https://rinkeby-explorer.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Lol wake up to 50k btc
undefined says Love it
undefined says Wonder if btc will see a higher high
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs hello Warner, was wondering if you could contact me regarding what is required to get a mapping added for an L2 token that is using IArbToken implementation.

The smart contract is already ready, thanks. 🙏
undefined says You are in the wrong forum for that.

This is about Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution.
undefined says Where can I buy $ARB?
undefined says it's worth it. Solana KYC's its validators, and that appears to be their long run solution. Arbitrum is pretty centralized currently, but anyone can be a validator, so it's built for decentralization long term.
undefined says my experience was 10x for a standard token contract. I wonder how your contract differs from that...
undefined says there is no arbitrum token
undefined says Lmao yah Ik I just noticed now😂🙏🏻 wrong server
undefined says fwiw, it seems like solana only required KYC to be part of their incentivized testnet program (like, to get people to run nodes even when there is no underlying value proposition for them to do so)
undefined says Hey guys,
undefined says Does anyone know when the token release for sale?
undefined says i saw this project is very potential
undefined says No token release or sale
undefined says arbitrum  coin  loanched yet?
undefined says miss  insert no
undefined says How can I take out a collaterlzied loan against my Eth on Arbitrum? MakeDAO seems to not have launched yet on Arbitrum.. or am I missing something?
undefined says i sao the token with sym ARB ơn market cap.? is it Scam?
undefined says If it’s claiming to be an Arbitrum token then yes it’s a scam, we don’t have a token
undefined says hi all, exited about this lauch. What is the state for a bridge where i can send from L1 Metamask to dapps on Arbitrum ?
undefined says Problem with L2 is always adoption. Loopring DEX is online since forever and have not changed the game
undefined says Hi. What are the fees you are experiencing on Arbitrum (ie: for a simple transfer) ? And how those tx fees are supposed to fluctuate depending on L1 congestion + L2 usage ?
undefined says everything you need is on bridge.arbitrum.io & portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says depends on congestion on both layers,  and i couldn't give you the math on it haha but if there's congestion on L1 then it'll have an effect on txs on l2
undefined says is gas optimization for arbitrum substantially different than on ethereum? eg. immutable variables. they're much cheaper than SLOADs on ethereum, but is that the case on arbitrum too?
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs hey AJ, any ETA on completing the custom bridge request? Thanks.
undefined says We are going to be releasing shortly precise instructions for getting additional tokens bridged across. We've been overloaded with requests and need to establish a process. I apologize but bear with us and we will get it done!
undefined says Thanks, super excited on our end as we are already deployed on mainnet, just waiting for a bridge👍
undefined says Replied to you
undefined says I msged you as well 😄
undefined says when I click "approve link" on sushiswap

nothing happens
undefined says Arbitrum fees go down the more it’s used, so as we see more Dapps launch and more transactions happening, the price of each transaction will drop (assuming blocks aren’t full). At the same time, you get the security of the Ethereum chain instead of relying on 800 Solana validators who can’t be punished for cheating you (slashing isn’t implemented). If you don’t care about the security, using a centralized service will be even cheaper than Solan (probably close to free).
undefined says Where can I find the mainnet rpc configuration information?
undefined says Well. Find it. Wonder why this information doesn't update at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs
undefined says hey everyone
undefined says is there another bridge being developed that i can withdraw back to ethereum without waiting 7 days?
undefined says or is there any centralized exchange that supports arbitrum deposits
undefined says asking for money needs in RL. my main source of income is crypto. 7 days is a bit too much for me 😄
undefined says are U planing to make a coin later ? 
if so , when do you think it will be ?
undefined says I believe Hop will be implementing their Arbitrum bridge over the next week which enables instant transfers of USDC  between L2s and mainnet.
undefined says that would perfectly work out for me but why just usdc lol
undefined says Alternative to hop.exchange https://cbridge.celer.network/#/
undefined says 
undefined says Does arbitrum use the same nodes as ethereum?
undefined says Can I use an ethereum node inside layer 2
undefined says No, they are custom nodes, and we haven't released documentation on how to run your own node.  Documentation will be ready sometime in the next few weeks
undefined says No token, see #🧠︱faq
undefined says Do you have a public node?
undefined says yes, https://bridge.arbitrum.io has directions on how to add public node.  Also available through many public providers like infura, alchemy, etc.
undefined says Last question, do the dapps have to be rewritten. For example does sushiswap have the same router address
undefined says Thats two different questions
undefined says So the router and factory addresses are exactly the same?
undefined says The dApps don't need to be rewritten
undefined says But the addresses are likely to be different, but not necessarily... it depends how they deploy the contracts
undefined says Allright thankyou!
undefined says I see that only https Nodes are available on Infura, are there any wss public nodes available?
undefined says I think infura is still working on websocket support
undefined says I think alchemy has support ready, possibly others as well
undefined says we are currently offering `wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws`, though don't know how long that will last
undefined says Where can I buy arb token
undefined says There is no token #🧠︱faq
undefined says I get an error: subscription method newPending Transactions is unsupported on Arbitrum when using WSS
undefined says newPendingTransactions doesn't make any sense because the sequencer sequences the transactions within seconds
undefined says use newHeader instead
undefined says Allright that makes sense!
undefined says Confirmed, Alchemy has websocket support.
undefined says uniswap info on mainnet looks a bit dead, is it because of bug in info page?
undefined says I'm wondering too, is uniswao v3 on arbitrum, seems everyone is deploying on sushiswap
undefined says i see! thanks! that’s helpful!
undefined says Hmm I asked a question thought 🤔💭😂
undefined says oops! haha i have no idea as well, but maybe arbitrum prefer sushiswap so most liquidity is in sushi for now
undefined says i was hoping it’s just a bug in info page, cause it looks kinda sad there
undefined says https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum/
undefined says which can happen from time to time
undefined says They are working on fixing the page. There is more than $0.30 of liquidity there lol
undefined says But does it work if we want to deploy on uniswap v3?
undefined says Uniswap is running, the info page is not working I believe
undefined says Is there a reason everyone is choosing sushi over uniswap v3?
undefined says For me uniswap v3 is much better so I have difficulty understanding this
undefined says I will have no problem if I list my coin on uni instead of v3? Any bugs etc
undefined says thanks for clarifying!
undefined says glad to know its a bug!
undefined says Hey there. How does "gas" work on arbitrum ? Is it an auction gas like on mainnet ?
undefined says I am trying to make my first transaction on Arbitrum (claiming my SWPR aidrop). Metamask sets the gas as 2,3 gwei. Making a very high total cost for the transaction (15$). How can I check if this 2,3 gwei is appropriate ?
undefined says I've not tried claiming the airdrop, but Arbitrum will only use the gas required to complete the transaction which has been around 1.2 gwei. So your likely to pay around half of what's been estimated. Hope this helps.
undefined says It helps a lot, thanks !
undefined says Hi Arbitrum people, I'm Yael from StarkWare, I'm here to learn about your rollup and hopefully together we will make Crypto a better place 🙌
undefined says One question that interests me is what are your plans regarding the fair sequencing? As far as I understand, currently you have one trusted Sequencer on mainnet but plan to progress to a trustless sequencing protocol. Do you have this protocol described somewhere? can you explain how would it work?
undefined says 
undefined says Im trying to deploy on mainet arbitrum
undefined says Is this the right configuration?
undefined says Also what would be the suggested gas and gasLimit my contract is pretty heavy
undefined says where do i buy arbitrum token
undefined says Here's my config on Rinkarby:
rinkarby: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "wss://arb-rinkeby.g.alchemy.com/v2/" + process.env.alchemyRinkarbyID),
      websockets: true,
      network_id: '421611',
      gas: 200000000,
      gasPrice: web3.utils.toWei('2', 'gwei'),
},
undefined says Does this look right?
undefined says No token,  see #4 #🧠︱faq
undefined says Network id  and the url
undefined says I use alchemy but the network id is correct. The gas is a magnitude too low, increase it as per my config.
undefined says I increased it to 70 Million
undefined says I see to deploy a contract it's between 20m to 60m you are using 200m isn't that high?
undefined says I fear I will run out of gas
undefined says It will only use whats required for the contract ... its a good idea to test out on Rinkarby and get an idea of the gas usage
undefined says I don't understand this step. Why do I have to add this, might it be the reason why I get the error "migrations" hit a require or revert statement somewhere in its constructor"
undefined says 
undefined says Is it a necessary step?
undefined says Another question, do I need to bridge the ethereum from rinkerby fauncet into L2 in order to deploy?
undefined says Yes but its a simple process
undefined says Did you manage to deploy contracts on rinkerby?
undefined says Using truffle
undefined says Yes
undefined says Is this a necessary step?
undefined says Is there something that a new user might miss that is different from normal deployment
undefined says Tbh, its been a while since I setup truffle but I followed the guide and got it working with little problems ... I'd suggest following the guide
undefined says Can you link me to it
undefined says This is likely to be gas limit being hit on Arbitrum if it works elsewhere
undefined says What exactly do you want a link to?
undefined says The guide but I think we are talking about the same one. Yea I just keep getting the same error now its "token" hit a require or revert statement somewhere in its constructor
undefined says 
undefined says And this is my constructor
undefined says The only thing I changed was the router address now I'm using susbiswap. Last time I deployed it on bsc it worked and I used the pancakeswap v2 router
undefined says Very strange
undefined says Its most likely gas limit being hit ... up your gas limit or remove it completely and let the tooling deal with it
undefined says Allright thank you will try that!
undefined says Wow it's so expensive contract costs about 0.35 eth to create is that normal?
undefined says Is there a way too see the contract in rinkeby, It says it has been deployed but I cannot find the arbitrum contract on rinkerby neither the tokens that Im supposed to have from the contract
undefined says Is that because arbitrum it's not supported?
undefined says Hey guys, I have 3 questions:
1) What is the contract size limit for Arbitrum One?
2) What is the block ArbGas limit for Arbitrum One?
3) Where are the current, up-to-date docs for Arbitrum One regarding these kinds of details ^ ? Not the end-goal of these parameters, but the **current values**

Thank you
undefined says Is there any documentation on how gas cost on arbitrum actually works? I can see some information on ArbiGas, but when I look at the transactions I still see 1gwei+ prices, priced in native ETH.
undefined says For large, storage hungry contracts this is what I would expect.
undefined says Do you have your wallet pointing at Rinkarby?
undefined says I deployed it on mainnet hopefully it works
undefined says There is no Arbiscan on Rinkarby unfortunately
undefined says Thanks a lot for your help
undefined says I wanted to try adding liquidity to sushiswap on rinkerby on arbitrum
undefined says Seems like it's not possible
undefined says Hey there. Thanks for the response. Unfortunately I was not asking about a block explorer. I was just trying to figure out what the contract size limit + block gas limit on Arbitrum One is.

Cheers
undefined says There isnt a contract size limit on Arbitrum as far as I'm aware
undefined says But you can set a gas limit, but this may cause your contract to fail when you deploy
undefined says They may not have deployed to Rinkarby
undefined says Any idea where the docs on this are @0xHunter - Farmland ?
undefined says Did you verify the contract through Arbiscan?
undefined says Try this https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbgas-and-fees
undefined says But these have been modified/restricted for the initial Arbitrum One launch. I was hoping I would be able to find up-to-date docs on the current state of these parameters
undefined says Sorry this is all I'm aware. Maybe someone from the team can chip in later.
undefined says I don't really know kinda complicated, even if sushi adds rinkeby you still won't be connected to arbitrum since arbitrum is something of its own
undefined says 0xHunter was referring to rinkarby, which is the arbitrum testnet deployed in rinkeby.  I do not know if sushi is deployed to the testnet
undefined says Ohh i though it was the same thing
undefined says So confusing
undefined says Got it
undefined says Are we expecting some official announcements when the big LP providers or things actually start using Arbitrum? E.g Uniswap, Sushiswap and etc still don't have almost anything on it
undefined says Quick question: is it right that all smart contracts on ethereum also work on arbitrum. Or is there a possibility that smart contracts that use reflexions and taxes do not work
undefined says I can point you at some documentation that details the differences between solidity on Arbitrum vs. Ethereum - https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/solidity_support
undefined says Hey team, I'm wondering what we should expect for transaction fees at steady state? I'm loving the speed of the network but still paid an average of $4-$5 in fees per transaction last night
undefined says Tx fees on Arbitrum are dependent on the base layer transaction fee.  The more people using arbitrum, the more transactions are rolled up together and the therefore more people splitting that mainnet tx fee
undefined says so theres no answer to that question.  It depends on adoption
undefined says Bump on this
undefined says if adoption goes to infinity, does the fees approach 0$, or is there some limit?
undefined says There is a limit as each transaction needs to store its calldata on L1. Note there are further optimizations  on the Arbitrum side which will be done at some point to reduce these costs from their current levels. In the longer term, Ethereum data sharding will massively decrease data storage costs. Ditto for data expiry and statelessness.
undefined says Hey! Does anyone know approximately how much it would cost to deploy an ERC721 contract on Arbitrum One mainnet?
undefined says Hi there, just tried withdrawing from Arbi to ETH. When I switch to mainnet I have pending transactions with a rough wait of 8 days. Does that mean a withdrawal button will pop up after 8 days for me to get the funds onto ETH mainnet ?
undefined says Does anyone have any links to literature or docs regarding projected gas costs on Arbitrum One beyond just that they will be lower than mainnet?
undefined says Correct
undefined says Cool thanks
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas
undefined says i'm trying to send LINK tokens from L2 to L1 on bridge.arbitrum.io but when i click add token, paste the address and press enter nothing happens
undefined says is link not available for bridging yet? i tried all 3 addresses in the token list and the last 1 gives me "Token is not registered to the mainnet bridge!"
undefined says never mind now it works for some reason
undefined says When I call contract.estimateGas, get MinArbGasForContractTx error, why?
undefined says Someone knows why uniswap have hidden arbitrum as option from their stats page?
undefined says Probably to address the issues with the data.
undefined says Arbitrum TVL on Uniswap is only 5.45m
undefined says that's still pretty small
undefined says still faster than optimism tbh
undefined says is there a list of rides in the amusement park?
undefined says i have no idea what i can use in arbi except  uniswap
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says Are bridgeable ERC721 (L1 <> L2) contracts currently available on mainnet?
undefined says I see reference to it here https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets and found the ERC20 files here https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/contract_docs, but can't find any for 721
undefined says Double bump on this
undefined says Yeah they are back today 10m USD TVL already.
undefined says Someone knows how much costs right now to add pool on Arbitrum and second question: is there a way to buy with fiat directly on L2 anything e.g eth, usdt,usdc
undefined says hey, i am a newbie here. Might sound like an idiot but wanted to ask that if I transfer my eth from ethereum mainnet to arb mainnet, i can use my eth on l2 now... but now i want to add more eth to layer 2 do i use the same process for adding eth or can i directly transfer my eth from exchange to layer 2 directly..
undefined says Direct withdrawals from centralized exchanges to Arbitrum are in the making but afaik none of the big ones offer that yet. So yeah, for now you have to go the process through the official bridge.
undefined says Thanks mate 👍
undefined says You're welcome
undefined says Also if i wanted to send my eth from l2 to another wallet connect to arb mainnet (l2) can i directly send or or i still have to go through the same l1 to l2 method
undefined says connected*
undefined says Hi i wanted tot know is there any listing/mapping criteria to bridge a custom token from L1-Arbitrum mainnet
undefined says Once on Arbitrum One, you should be able to send to another wallet within Arbitrum.  Just make sure to have your other wallet connected to the Arbitrum one network.
undefined says Is it possible to buy the indexcoop DPI on Arbitrum?
undefined says Thanks a ton buddy
undefined says 
undefined says Guys I want to ask some dumb question, is arbitrum a chain or an exchange? Secondly, is it compatible with matamask and how do I interact with it?
undefined says Arbitrum is a layer 2 rollup. Rollups allows for scaling a layer 1 protocol (mainly ethereum) without losing any security, by executing transactions off chain. It is a bit like a chain, although the terminology is a little different. 

Metamask is a wallet, it's what you use to interact with the Ethereum (or ethereum based) blockchains
undefined says I cant use perpetual protocol on arb1?
undefined says It is a chain. Specifically a L2 rollup chain. You can use MetaMask just like on Ethenreum Main Chain, Polygon, BSC, Optimism, etc.
undefined says Guys launchpad on arbitrum is great opportunity
undefined says can you deploy smart contracts on mainnet?
undefined says you can use https://cap.finance/ for leverage trading on Arbitrum (BTC, ETH, LINK, AAVE, UNI, SUSHI, YFI)
undefined says bump on this
undefined says Anyone know if this list will be maintained - https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json
undefined says "token list" what's meaning
undefined says that's the list of currently accepted ERC20 tokens on Arbitrum. They haven't opened the platform up fully yet for general trading, each token has to be whitelisted.
undefined says thanks
undefined says hiii
undefined says 
undefined says help me?
undefined says I withdraw money from l2 to l1 it gives an error and deducted my money, can you help me?
undefined says guys, are fees on Arbi  mainnet high because there are not enough txns in a single batch.
undefined says is there an official bridge UI? If not, what bridges are out there that work well?
undefined says Hi team. When and how can i buy Arbitrum token
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says When do you open for sale?
undefined says I opened it up and found nothing.
undefined says Works fine for me.
undefined says Very good question, we are looking to build solutions for this in fact
undefined says Arbitrum is still truly undervalued as it's definitely one of the best solutions for scaling out there
undefined says https://twitter.com/CapDotFinance/status/1436391178522578946
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs after being so successful in testnet, you can now try it out for real 👀
undefined says Are there any developer incentives for building on Arbitrum One, like other platforms offer? (FTM, AVAX)
undefined says What is the cheapest way to get funds from Polygon to Arbitrum? Are there any bridges that don't have to go through Eth mainnet first?
undefined says This one worked well for me earlier: https://cbridge.celer.network/#/
undefined says can anyone tell me how to see the chart?
undefined says Looks like the gas estimate aligns with L1 but not with arbi. I did a test contract where I:

- ran the gas estimate with hardhat
- deployed to rinkeby L1
- deployed to arbi mainnet

The first two were identical but for arbi the gas cost was much higher

L1 - 67066
Arbitrum - 1305965

Anyone else experiencing this? Any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong?
undefined says gas units are different
undefined says arbigas != L1 gas
undefined says ome question about the "Unconfirmed ETA: Any minute!"
undefined says 
undefined says On Arb network it shows that I could withdrawal my ETH but after I switched to Layer1 it shows I cannot withdraw.
undefined says 
undefined says It confuses me..
undefined says some one can give me Arbitrum RPC ?
undefined says Every time I perform swap on the 2-layer dapp of arbitrum, it fails to succeed, and the gwei fee cannot be displayed. Why?

 Is it still not possible to swap in the second layer of arbitrum?
undefined says https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says thank you
undefined says Same question here on Twitter. If somebody can provide a docs link with more information (here or on twitter), it would be much appreciated
https://twitter.com/paveldcr/status/1436663327229415427
undefined says Yea found that after some digging. Thanks!
undefined says hi. Do projects need to whitelist to deploy on Arbitrum?

Because we are planning to launch our project on Arbitrum later this month! Thanks!
undefined says has anyone ever used cbridge to move into arbitrum?
undefined says No, anyone can deploy code on the network now
undefined says Can i swap my token from polygon mainnet to arbitrum?
undefined says what is the service for comparing rates for arbitration between dex), how can you link furucombo and arbitrum
undefined says can someone send me the link for the bridge
undefined says cant find
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs May I DM? or any admin?
undefined says goodness https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0125fd40d51a5cebf5106f82cc778b00665a4ceef8ff42445f6b252ac4e68b90
undefined says how are transactions ordered on Arbitrum ? what mechanism does the sequencer use ?
undefined says binance?
undefined says quick question. how many validators does Arbitrum have ?
undefined says 
undefined says How can I locally fork Arbitrum with hardhat?
undefined says currently using the normal way of forking produces this error:
undefined says Looks like they were put into ArbNyan
undefined says First come first served
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Is there a spec for erc721 bridges yet or how are we going to manage it?
undefined says do we need to deploy custom gateway contracts to get it to work?
undefined says Guyss
undefined says What does bridging do ?
undefined says Im new to arbitrum
undefined says soo how to unwrap my weth on arbitrum?
undefined says use sushiswap
undefined says faster and cheaper than pptimism gg
undefined says sushiswap everywhere lol thats great
undefined says just ez
undefined says that's why haha
undefined says yeah, but metamask mobile kinda broken
undefined says try later on my laptop
undefined says If one has initiated an ETH withdrawal via the bridge back to L1 do you know if there is anyway to bypass the longer withdrawal process?, eg it is saying in approx 8 days (45818) blocks. I did read you can bypass this but not sure if its possible if you have already initiated a withdrawal.
undefined says Where's the best place to see the TVL for all protocols deployed to arbitrum? L2beat doesn't have it and DeFi Llama seems egregiously wrong
undefined says last block was 25min ago on arbiscan, is mainnet stuck or something?
undefined says Totally new to arbitrum. How can I use it, ie to trade. I've got the network setup on mm. What AMMs work on it?
undefined says no, looks like its an arbiscan issue
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/886389049714159647
undefined says 
undefined says does any one know why i can deposit, this ir the messege i get when I try
undefined says hi guys, where did you all find new token in arbitrium
undefined says how do i transfer assets to arbitrum
undefined says via the arbitrum bridge
undefined says Hi, after bridge to L2 we must wait 7 days to withdraw funds right?
undefined says the standard withdrawal takes 7 days yes
undefined says When should we expect the bridge to bridge NFTs?
undefined says If i bridge my ETH over onto Arbitrum, how can i stake it to earn passive income?
undefined says Does someone know why the nyan deposit contract is shown as proxy to itself on arbiscan?
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9F7968de728aC7A6769141F63dCA03FD8b03A76F#code
undefined says IMHO, it would be better to show batches instead of blocks in the arbiscan... i personally feel the block updates are too frequent and not that valuable on the page, perhaps a toggle would work?
undefined says agreed but theyve forked etherscan and this may not be a priority for them rn
undefined says hmm is there a way we can contribute these changes.
undefined says is the explorer open source
undefined says etherscan isnt
undefined says yeah but I saw offchain labs github repo, didn't see their fork in rpeo.. probably its named differently
undefined says im guessing arbiscan isnt open source either
undefined says if you wanna build an explorer check out otterscan
undefined says its not hosted right now, but you can always host
undefined says oh wow TIL
undefined says re: otterscan
undefined says hi there - can someone explain how Ethereum secures Arbitrum ? given L2 is practically a different network
undefined says ELI5 all the transactions are compressed and saved to l1. there is a dispute resolution mechanism so people cant cheat
undefined says if you want ELI grownup there is a ton of content online
undefined says I recommend starting here : https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_basics
undefined says the gas is sky-rocketing now?
undefined says Indeed, is there a gas tracker for arb?
undefined says Why did the team throttle the network because their rpcs got overloaded?
undefined says If you can't get your rpc to work, do not throttle the network
undefined says literally the last thing to do
undefined says people who use their own rpcs (like me) now just get expensive txns for 0 reason
undefined says I'm think they changed some parameters : gwei sky-rocketed but arbgas is way less expensive

A NYIAN getreward cost 850600 arbgas and 1gwei yesterday, today it's 4700 arbgas and 300gwei
undefined says txns are now 2-5x more expensive
undefined says why do you say network throttled?
https://arbiscan.io/batches
undefined says Gas is a lot more expensive
undefined says was 1-3 before, now 400+
undefined says (they manually changed params to do that)
undefined says Yes but arbgas is less expensive
undefined says I know, but at 400 it's noticable
undefined says generally doubling costs
undefined says or another theory to this is they botched some update to the network, as arbiscan numbers aren't all matching rpc results, it seems like a big mess rn
undefined says the real transaction is not like 3GWEI versus 300GWEI
undefined says the real gas cost is like $2 -> $10
undefined says Is there a dashboard for base fee currently?
undefined says I don't get it maybe but aren't L2 txs supposed to be magnitude cheaper?
undefined says compare to Ethereum it is cheaper. and team mentioned in blog that they cap the speed in the beginning and will release it to full power gradually
undefined says hey guys you need to understand, that most of the current gas costs come from L1 and they are independent of the arbgas costs, so arbgas from 40-400GWEI doesn't mean 10fold transaction cost, it only means that the additional costs additional to L1 (which is at the moment minor costs) tenfold look at the advanced tabs in the block explorers
undefined says So 0.00696904912242 is not the actual ETH fee here?
undefined says it is, if you go on advanced tab you will see the split between L1 and L2 fees
undefined says Does anyone have a few bucks to spare 😅
undefined says Tryna bridge some eth
undefined says But i converted it all to weth and now i cant pay gas
undefined says L2 Computational Paid:
0.00634633624031704 ETH
undefined says yep in this case you paid more for L2 than for L1, probably the high L2 fees are because of Arbitrum reaching the artificial throttling limit (which will get lifted in the future)
undefined says Thanks btw for explaining. I'm just trying to understand how fees are summed up
undefined says So my current understanding is the following: There is a L2 arbgas cost that changes based on traffic and the throttling, then a transaction pays L1 fees (independent of arbgas costs) and L2 fees depending on how much arbgas it uses. Then on the main page of the explorers they transform everything into arbgas, i.e. by using the L1 costs and the arbgas cost they can calculate how much arbgas the L1 fees correspond to. This means doing the same transaction with the same L1 costs might take a completely different amount of arbgas if the arbgas price changed a lot.
undefined says https://twitter.com/pj935591/status/1436982537801240579
undefined says guys what I am doing wrong, cant believe the L2 gas cost currently are this high?
undefined says "will be" is wrong here, "currently are" would be better. When the throttling of beta will be lifted things will look different
undefined says Arbitrum already doing 8 tps
undefined says nice
undefined says happy now? 🙂
undefined says what defi you guys are on ?
undefined says Arbitrum has hit speed limit of 80,000 arbgas per second
undefined says One swap is about 15k arbgas
undefined says GMX for now, check uniswap top tokens and liquidity
undefined says Any idea what is $HONEY token?
undefined says cant find its webpage
undefined says found it
undefined says https://thehoneypot.finance/farms
undefined says how to add liq
undefined says okey got it
undefined says someone can help me, some artiture about arbitum?
undefined says any suggested tutorial for contract deployment on arbitrum?
undefined says Any admins here? I need to report a bug
undefined says hey guys sorry if stupid question. Do i need to set up my metamask to point to the arbittrum network or do i just use the bridge and it all works?
undefined says ah i got it, the add network button
undefined says https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-arbitrum-and-setting-up-metamask-for-arbitrum-543e513cdd8b
undefined says how is eth represented in arbitrum? is eth native or is it represented in weth?
undefined says native on arbitrum
undefined says to get back on mainnet you'd need to go through the bridge to swap it back from the bridge contract
undefined says iinm
undefined says cant unwrap the weth
undefined says unwrap button didnt work on sushiswap
undefined says Hello ! where can I buy these tokens please ?
undefined says where can I buy arbitrum token ? please  ?
undefined says https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/
undefined says Anybody know a multicall address on mainnet?
undefined says Answered my own question with a simple Github search  😂 Multicall: 
`0xadF885960B47eA2CD9B55E6DAc6B42b7Cb2806dB`
undefined says hey guys, is somewhere tracking which projects are live on arbitrum?
undefined says hello guys, Arbitrum token has public sale schedule yet?
undefined says Hi, here is the list : https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says hey, we are moving cudl.finance to arbitrum
undefined says We nee help with bridging the token
undefined says who can I contact? I already filled out the form but never heard back
undefined says We are all ready to launch and deployed besides the token.
undefined says Sorry
undefined says Hello Guys, When ı am transfer between my other account. Some ETH still my old account(near 2$) why ?
undefined says Is mainnet live?
undefined says I literally can't tell
undefined says seems like it is
undefined says cc @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs @Ben Burgess | Offchain Labs it would be very good to update the #🧠︱faq channel with mainnet info
undefined says Hello there! I'm wondering about this - what is the definition of 'staking' here?

https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol
undefined says How does one determine how much gas to pay?
undefined says Good idea, will get working on having that updated!
undefined says How to authorize and manage tokens on the arbitrum network? I can't cancel some authorizations
undefined says Does Arbitrum has a wss endpoint？
undefined says @Ben Burgess | Offchain Labs @fred Where should I manage token approvals on Arbitrum？
undefined says If you mean added to the official bridge then they're currently taking requests for custom token bridge support at info@offchainlabs.com where you'll be added to a queue for support.
undefined says Is there any guidance on setting up a node available somewhere?
undefined says no they dont care much about the devs
undefined says Any person experienced that can tell me if it's a legit farm ?
Seems legit but it's just hours hold
 https://arbiape.com
undefined says sad!
undefined says aped in
undefined says With Gnosis Safe not being deployed for Arbitrum yet, what multisig would you recommend projects?
undefined says anyone got link
undefined says bridge?
undefined says to what
undefined says oh
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says ty
undefined says why cant type in  eth
undefined says 0.05
undefined says Can someone tell me what this address is?
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006e
I apparently made a transfer of >1 ETH there some hours ago but I don't see it on the bridge UI... freaking a bit out...
undefined says @Sebastian | HOPR No spamming.
undefined says Dunno if the bot deleted my previous msg but I'm wondering what address 0x000...00063 is. Looks like the withdrawal side of the bridge but I don't see it on the UI.
undefined says bump on this
undefined says That is arbitrum retriable transaction precompile.  If you give me your L1 transaction ID, we can resolve it
undefined says thanks I will DM
undefined says 0x00...6e is a special built-in contract ArbRetryableTx.  when you bridge stuff from L1 it gets picked up by that.
undefined says Any protocols launched on Arbitrum yet where I can take out a loan against my ETH?
undefined says hi
undefined says how can buy token
undefined says this project doesnot have token
undefined says HI
undefined says Where can I apply for the token white list
undefined says i just received an email from a prince in nigeria saying that i am eligible to claim a $5m arbitrum token airdrop. how do i claim?
undefined says Hey guys, was wondering if anyone had attempted mainnet forking on arbitrum with hardhat or brownie, im having issues with contract deployment on a mainnet-fork
undefined says Hey guys, i deployed a contract on ethereum and it costs 4,368,369 gas, then i deployed the same contract on arbitrum, but it costs 162,816,697 gas, it's too much higher than ethereum, is this normal?
undefined says hi all, has anyone else noticed issues getting events from the network using Web3 ?  (more details in the support channel)
undefined says I have the same issue
undefined says Same issue as mwsimp and sebastian, I was trying to withdraw and it has the transaction address set to that and my funds are locked up for the 7 day challenge period.
undefined says Will the funds still go to my L1 wallet or is this a bug?
undefined says Can our team get a retweet from the Arb guys?

https://twitter.com/StabilizePro/status/1437413600168235009
undefined says The issue that i described in more detail above was actually just an arbiscan bug: the INcoming funding ETH tx INTO your wallet is shown as an OUTgoing tx FROM your wallet... At the same time, if you actually initiated a withdrawal (I didn't add please note that deposit and withdrawal addresses are minimally different although they both start with all `0`s) it's normal that there's a delay of about ~7 days, this is IMO sufficiently communicated by the team
undefined says yeah the 7 day period I understood I just had the 000 address attached to my transaction as well which tripped me out
undefined says 
undefined says but it looks like thats not going to mess with the actual transaction coming back to the wallet from what youre saying
undefined says Any developer instructions for running a mainnet node? I looked through the online documentation but didn't see info for starting the node after installing the source code
undefined says currently you cant, in the near future you'll be able to
undefined says Ok thanks!
undefined says Cap.finance $23M+ vol on Arbitrum and it hasn't been a week since launch 👀
undefined says Hey - this is Owen, a journalist with The Defiant. Do folks know if there's a way to see value locked on Arbitrum by token?
undefined says arbiscan shows the price x amount (market cap) of certain tokens on Arbitrum
undefined says example: https://arbiscan.io/token/0x031d35296154279dc1984dcd93e392b1f946737b
undefined says fully diluted market cap there means value of tokens on Arbitrum L2, but there are also tokens on L1
undefined says ah awesome, thanks
undefined says nice! needed this piece of info
undefined says for those interested, the mcap of all tokens on Arbitrum are here: https://arbiscan.io/tokens
undefined says Impressive
undefined says yes, keep in mind these marketcaps there are not 'tokens on Arbitrum L2'
undefined says these are total mcaps
undefined says Including L1 ETH?
undefined says in that chart, yes
undefined says Thanks. Is there anywhere with a list of Dapps live on Mainnet?
undefined says (fully diluted market cap in the token specific page applies only for Arbitrum L2 tokens though)
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says Awesome thanks
undefined says not sure I understand... eg USDT's mcap on Arbitrum is $14.6M, overall it's $69B. The 14.6 is the value of all USDT on Arbitrum no?
undefined says I'd like to add a +1 to this request - would be nice to run a node locally.
undefined says Hello, could some one provide information about Arbitrum mainnet?
undefined says First question is it already possible to create dapps ?
undefined says On arbitrum mainnet
undefined says can we please merge #mainnet and #general 😄
undefined says Someone answered that, yeah?
undefined says that doesn't sound right, the node's code is in the repository, it's just missing documentation on how to configure it
undefined says from my understanding its changing alot under the hood and theyre cleaning up how syncing works
undefined says you'd have a very hard time syncing it 😄
undefined says so the official answer is "no, not right now"
undefined says that doesn't sound right either 😄
undefined says 🤷  take it up with mgmt
undefined says bump on this
undefined says Also, are there any multisig protocols that have been deployed to Arbitrum One?
undefined says not yet
undefined says i think
undefined says Hello All, can anyone tell me what is the average fee in Arbitrum?
undefined says same question
undefined says I have checked few transactions where the fee is varying between 0.000483293726816768 ETH and 0.000641248265478618 ETH
undefined says it seems to be same as what we pay in L1
undefined says let me know what l1 youre using
undefined says Id love to get to use it
undefined says thanks bro
undefined says today i tried transferring eth to arb1 and the fee is 14 usd from L1
undefined says hi guys - can someone point me to the process of on-boarding a new token to Arbitrum, please
undefined says right... the most important process is the least talked about.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets
undefined says I think the fee is fine since the bridging involved L1. However, important thing is that you should have faster and cheaper confirmation of the txs in L2.
undefined says This is basically it. But just explains it from a theoretical standpoint. For a custom token it is asking for a new L1 and L2 tokens as if we can simply change the L1 tokens we have.
undefined says Are we supposed to just create a new mainnet token for every L2 now?
undefined says Literally easier to just bridge an ERC20 and then wrap it into our custom implementation if it's this complex (bad UX tho)
undefined says But still had zero answers for basically anything
undefined says Should I be able to read an arbitrum deployed contract coming straight from learning ethereum solidity?
undefined says I am eyeing an ethereum development bootcamp
undefined says Hey has anyone actually been able to bridge back? https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ does not do anything when I try to..
undefined says it takes 7 days
undefined says yeah but it does not show a transaction has been initiated or anything
undefined says Metamask is not being called
undefined says nvm, was not leaving enough for gas
undefined says so exciting! Arbitrum on the top 
https://twitter.com/NEAR_daily/status/1437606035624054791
undefined says Hi guys, how much do you guys set the gas with metamask?
undefined says How much GWEI?
undefined says When we can instant withdraw from l2 to l1?
undefined says Just used the arbitrum eth bridge
undefined says Works perfectly
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x48ca9bdfbcf7a1564a911d33a7fb7a9f7a9080e2307d5cc5542b3519bd8bd690
undefined says When I withdrawals my eth back L2 to L1 main chain I can't get my eth and now it over 7 day ago
undefined says Pls help me
undefined says Can anyone help me. Why can't I change WETH to ETH through the Arbitrum network connection to uniswap, and the expansion status is always displayed?
undefined says 🙂
undefined says Sounds like you don't have the ETH to process that transaction 👀
undefined says greetings, is there a MultiCall contract on arbitrum? 
https://github.com/makerdao/multicall
undefined says hello guys. is there any problem verifying contracts at the moment?
undefined says Hello, has anyone dealt with following issue: I have sent USDT on L2 and have problem with approving USDT on SushiSwap and UniSwap. After click Approve USDT nothing happens.
undefined says 👆
undefined says yo
undefined says i suppose we need some arbitrum token at some point to make tx right?
undefined says i want to bridge some usdt from bsc
undefined says https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer
undefined says Did you announced when you planned to launch the token?
undefined says no new arbitrum blocks for a few minutes...
undefined says i am trying to unwrap WETH to AETH and transactions are failing on both balancer and sushi.
undefined says 
undefined says Yeah arbitrum error guys
undefined says what is the LINK contract?
undefined says arbitrum is down seems like
undefined says any communication from the team ?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085189823266875/887344706466508860 only this
undefined says Hi, is there a guide on how I can run a arbitrum node? thx
undefined says Oh, I'd be interested in that as well.
undefined says I've been asking about uptime guarantees for 3 months now :/
No shade, but its a good opportunity for a third party service
To run sequencer - super profitable
undefined says Is there a way to see the estimated gas/price of your contract before deploying it?  I've lost like $200 in failed txs because my contract is fairly big
undefined says Down again? More than a minute since the last block....
undefined says Sucky uptime on the bridge /:
undefined says Anybody using Arb now? I have a stuck tx. Tried to speed up, to cancel, but it just keeps showing more txs in the queue... and still pending
undefined says You must replace it with the same nonce as the stuck one
undefined says Otherwise Metamask will queue the next ones
undefined says Send ETH to yourself and use the same nonce as the stuck one but with a high gas price to effectively cancel it
undefined says What are the current contract size limits? I've noticed that Arbitrum contracts use significantly more gas than their ETH counterpart and that the gas estimator fails if some sort of magic number is hit
undefined says Gas on Arbitrum is very different than Ethereum. We have this concept of arbgas
undefined says Did you try deploying on Rinkeby first? Was it working there? Deploy on Rinkeby and put the estimate gas wayyyy up
undefined says Yeah. It can deploy on Rinkeby (Ethereum) with just under 3 million gas units used
undefined says When I try a cut down version on Arbitrum One, gas unit cost is exceeding 50 million
undefined says Ohh. Just realized there is an Arbitrum Rinkeby. Let me check that
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7dc4ba7a4853565496cf8c13868efb1558bcce0
undefined says Just checked it. My test contract runs on Arbitrum Rinkeby but costs 107M gas units to deploy!
undefined says Arbgas and Ethereum gas are not 1:1
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbgas-and-fees
undefined says Ok. But why does it run out of gas when trying to deploy on Arb mainnet?
undefined says can you send me the rinkeby deployment link?
undefined says I dm'd you it
undefined says Hi, etherscan for Arbitrum doesn't work? Just made first time swap on Uniswap, wanna see details, but can't reach site.
undefined says Also is there any chance to check what's contract address for CELR on Arb1?
undefined says no advertisements please
undefined says Hi curious if there is a plan for a token with ARB? Most L2's and or sidechains or other ecosystems have tokens so I'm assuming Arbitrum will as well? If anyone has any info on this would be greatly appreciated
undefined says See #🧠︱faq No token, no airdrop, no plans, ever
undefined says ever huh.. dont see that mentioned in the FAQ
undefined says ```4. Does Offchain Labs offer a token?
No.
```
undefined says https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1436723111563517959
undefined says And a billion times in the discord chat history, there is no token
undefined says Good move
undefined says lol I get your tired of answer the question @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs
undefined says how is that a good move @happypsyduck ?
undefined says It shows that Arbitrum is really just an extension of ETH
undefined says so every other L2.. sidechain and ecosystem that has a token that was a bad move?
undefined says There are not many other L2s
undefined says But if there were, yes
undefined says maybe not true L2
undefined says I'm here because I'm excited about Arbitrum.. but I dont see how not having a token is beneficial
undefined says like makes no sense actually
undefined says Sidechains can run their own blockchains independently so it makes sense they have their own tokens
undefined says There has been many attempts at making ETH scale and run faster.. all of which have tokens.. and marketcaps to prove they were good decisions
undefined says so I'm just not tracking
undefined says what your trying to say
undefined says True L2s like Arbitrum work ontop of ETH, therefore it makes sense to use ETH as gas
undefined says I understand that
undefined says still doesn't explain why a token is a bad idea.. a token can be used for a million different things doesn't have to be the main currency used on the L2 for transactions doesnt have to take away from ETH at all actually
undefined says Ahh so you want a governance token?
undefined says Any token related to the project yes
undefined says for any of the several use cases that could arise
undefined says re:sequencer outage - since sequencer mode is optional, should all dapps be able to fallback from sequenced mode to non-sequenced. is that a right way to think about it?
undefined says @Chappie arbitrum uses chainlink's l2
undefined says There's your token
undefined says Dangerous drinking game: take a shot every time someone mentions an arbitrum token
undefined says For some explanation of how arbitrum relates to link: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/scalable-low-cost-computation-of-ethereum-smart-contracts-using-arbitrum-on-the-chainlink-8985c6542d4e
undefined says I'm noticing that for deploying contracts to mainnet, it can cost more than layer 1 ethereum when eth gas prices are below 50 gwei
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/address/0xba24533daf78edde4fef86e1aaced06415ab29de#writeContract
undefined says mint free EscalationPunks   first 100 is free
undefined says where i can buy ARB sir.?
undefined says Buy LINK
undefined says Arbitrum does not have its own token
undefined says https://escalationpunks.com/
undefined says our website now launch ,you can mint and list you's espunks
undefined says After I use docker to run the node, Found that the node block height is much lower than the browser. Is this the same for you?
undefined says escalationopunks is going to airdrop the first 50 EsPunks   check here https://t.me/escalationpunks
undefined says Hi. I tried to deploy ERC721 contract on arbitrum Mainnet. But I always get 2 errors. Not enough funds or ran out of gas. I have 0.1ETH on arbitrum Mainnet. Where am i wrong? I couldn’t try Rinkby testnet cause of eth faucet didn’t sen ethers.
undefined says You probably probably just need to increase the gas limit
undefined says can i dm you ss of my truffle?
undefined says Sure
undefined says Sent friend
undefined says Why i dont see my NYAN which i am staking?
undefined says Hello there! Where i can find cryptodev for good things based on arbitrum?)
undefined says node question: is it possible to get a local rpc node that gets synchornized with the network without depending on the rpcs hosted by infura or arbitrum? getting any amount of significant data is expensive and slow with those
undefined says I'm pretty much bruteforcing the configuration in the arbitrum monorepo but it looks like the geth fork always starts from 0 and wanting to mine the whole chain
undefined says The display window is too slow
undefined says Take a long time to show
undefined says why did this happen?
undefined says https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-and-arbitrum-knocked-offline-while-ethereum-evades-attack
undefined says I've checked bridge https://cbridge.celer.network/#/transfer 
you can swap to Etherium mainnet in 15 min.  So no need to wait 7 days.
undefined says isn't there an extra fee for this?
undefined says What's the custom gateway address for mainnet? Is there a predeployed one?
undefined says Or do we need to deploy our own?
undefined says y, but it takes 15 min compared to 7+ days
undefined says Were you able to resolve this?
undefined says still working on it, found some repos that resolved this. Im sure the arbitrum team are busy
undefined says Were you able to resolve this issue?
undefined says Care to share which repos have workarounds?
undefined says :arbitrum:
undefined says no
undefined says sadly not
undefined says Does anybody know, how can I add a new unlisted token?
undefined says Does arbitrum support the `eth_subscribe` rpc call?
undefined says For subscribing to transactions
undefined says This is the main issue I believe: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/issues/1607
undefined says ^^^ Anyone?
undefined says You mean the rpc url for Arbitrum One mainnet?
undefined says I'm looking for the custom token gateway address
undefined says Could anybody help me to understand Arbitrum coz I need to integrate it to my project
undefined says I heard on Arbitrum, we do calculation and update the changed states on L1
So I thought for example on Uniswap, when we swap tokenA to tokenB, Arbitrum just does calculation for transfer and reflect it to L1
But all transactions are done on Arbitrum and not reflected to L1
Am I wrongly understood about Arbitrum? If then, whats the difference between Arbitrum and Polygon?
Imagine if I integrate Arbitrum to my project. Should I deploy the contract on Arbitrum and setup bridge?
undefined says @Denisa @roo | Won't DM u 1st Would you guide me ^^^?
undefined says I'll check it out
undefined says oh yeah, totally seems like the problem
undefined says I'm not as smart as the guy who made the PR, but would 100% make sense why it happens, using wrong parsing
undefined says Is there an API for seeing if Arbitrum is down?
undefined says or is the best way to get the last block and just monitor if that stays the same for x minutes
undefined says Am I authorize to shill a Utility Security token?
undefined says would that be on the #☕︱gm  only?
undefined says where i can buy eth arbitrum?
undefined says Unsupported block number error?
undefined says You can just bridge it over using the arbitrum bridge
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs  or @RGates  would be very helpful hearing from you on this 🙂
undefined says yeah same
undefined says i dont remember my app having unsupported block number yesterday
undefined says and i didnt really change my code
undefined says I have 0.34 ETH in my   Metamask pointing to Ethereum mainnet yet when I login mainnet in Arbitrum Bridge, All I see is ETH on L1: 0
undefined says Tried rebooting my computer, did not work
undefined says where can I buy the Arbitrum token, please?
undefined says I've noticed that Arbitrum explorer doesn't show internal transactions
undefined says thanks mate, so there is no Arbitrum token for purchase, rigtht?
undefined says No arby token.
undefined says 😩
undefined says hi ! do someone know how to works a multicall contract ? I already deployed one but with no validator in arbistrum how can we do it ?
undefined says Could someone explain how `maxGas` and `maxSubmissionCost` are calculated for the bridge tx to L2? It looks like you query the node to get some gas slippage number and then increase it by a percentage?
undefined says we are calling the bridge contract primarily to be able to specify a different `to address` in this function:
```outboundTransfer(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount, uint256 _maxGas, uint256 _gasPriceBid, bytes _data```
undefined says as the UI unfortunately doesn't allow this
undefined says are there instructions for how to run a node? who is collecting all of the tx fees?
undefined says Any useful arbi explorer?
undefined says arbiscan
undefined says Seem the default one has limited function
undefined says but it's limited indeed
undefined says Thx
undefined says Etherscan is fantastic
undefined says hello, we are from https://waterfallbot.info/#/

we are trying to integrate price tracking bot for all token on arbitrum

can you give me public websocket endpoint of arbitrum ?
undefined says maxFeePerGas
undefined says The batchs have not been updated for more than an hour. https://arbiscan.io/batches
undefined says :peepocheck:
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c6f947ae67f572afa4ae0730947de7c874f95ef#events
undefined says I'm still seeing batch processing on the eth side
undefined says Ok
undefined says I'm not sure if this is an issue with arbiscan or if something else is wrong
undefined says Thanks for your reply
undefined says arbiscan seems to be broken for contracts too (doesn't show an address is an contract even if it's used as one, for ex. Sushi token)
undefined says Hi guys! trying to deploy contract on mainnet but getting error 
Internal JSON-RPC error. { "code": -32000, "message": "execution ran out of gas" }

gas limit: 400000

trying to deploy from remix
undefined says Could we buy now arbitrum?
undefined says May want to increase your gas limit or reduce your contract size
undefined says will try, thank you
undefined says the rpc endpoint https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc regularly gives incorrect values. just ask for current block number and you'll soon enough get a reponse that's like 10000+ blocks behind the actual current block number. same with account nonce, account balance even.
undefined says Node is overworked it seems. Wish there were more mirrors
undefined says qq: does the bridge support deposit for? send from X address, receive at Y address
I want to use it with a multisig sc wallet and receive in another mutisig sc wallet in the other end
undefined says are there any fast bridges other than celer cbridge?
undefined says Does anyone know a multicall deployment on arbitrum one and arbitrum testnet?
undefined says when deploying on mainnet using a hardhat script, do you:
-  recommend to wait x secs between each transaction?
- set the gaslimit to X on all calls, or is better to just not specify it ?
undefined says does the fact that time is not the same in Arbitrum affects Oracles implemented using Uni v2 oracle lib?
undefined says is anyone able to shed some light here? Are there any safe defaults for this to prevent funds from getting stuck?
undefined says I believe the AVM (arbi v machine) will take contract sizes above the EVM limit. You don't have to make your contract size smaller, but you WILL need to increase your gas limit by an order of magnitude.
undefined says Hello, I'm looking to test some contracts on mainnet which I currently use on ETH L1. What parameters should I use to configure Truffle? Specifically provider and networkID. I can't seem to find any for Mainnet
undefined says hey guys where can i go to keep track of new and upcoming arbitrum projects?
undefined says 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064

What do these two addresses represent? What's the difference? Why do people come out of the first address and some people come out of the second
[11:24]
Is there anyone in the group who can help
undefined says has anyone succesfully run their own arbitrum rpc node?
undefined says 👀
undefined says @A.J. Warner | Offchain Labs  I want to make sure that the ERC20 Token I created on arbitrum  can be mapped to an ERC20 token already deployed in ethereum?
undefined says How we can buy ARB
undefined says ?
undefined says Hi, I need to build an archive node here, do I need to add any parameters to docker?
Still need to compile and run?
undefined says token?
undefined says I have been trying to remove liquidity from Uniswap under Arbitrum network, yet since last night I have not been able to do so. I'm using Metamask-Ledger wallet environment. In fact, I've done this without any problem 3-4 days ago. Please help.
undefined says @Ben Burgess | Offchain Labs
undefined says I try to withdraw from bridge, nothing happens. Browser console shows:

MetaMask - RPC Error: Internal JSON-RPC error. {code: -32603, message: "Internal JSON-RPC error.", data: {…}}

Uncaught (in promise) {code: -32603, message: "Internal JSON-RPC error.", data: {…}}

Any hints?
undefined says Is there plans for a faster bridge back to L1?
undefined says You could use cBridge http://cbridge.celer.network/
undefined says Used it quite a lot now, works pretty well
undefined says Can't transfer eth through cbridge though
undefined says Or am i missing something?
undefined says You can transfer WETH. But you don’t receive gas on arrival. I  believe the team are working on it
undefined says If you like, I can lend you ETH to unwrap your WETH on arrival, if you can return it to me right after
undefined says Thank you! But I'd have to pay mai net fees to unwrap upon arrival via uniswap or other dex, true?
undefined says (and L2 fees to wrap on arb1 before using the bridge)
undefined says Yeah, there would be unwrap transactions. From experience they cost about $2–4 each
undefined says That's not too much btw :)
undefined says Thank you very much brother
undefined says No probs. Just dm me if needed
undefined says How does the arbitrum explorer work? I see transactions, which note blocks, but not blocks. What's the analog of a block in Arbitrum?
undefined says where can I find information on running an arbitrum mainnet and/or testnet node?
undefined says @ladyprofessional or @dzack23 | Offchain Labs ? would really love to find an answer to this... can't seem to find anywhere...
undefined says Stay tuned. It is on our priority list to get out there ASAP, but nothing really available that is easy to digest right now
undefined says anything hard to digest? Desperate for anything... and I am not exactly a technical todler 🙂
undefined says if you have any base configs or anything like that I would be very excited
undefined says I could even commit to helping to write a guide of some sort if I got the minimum information needed to get it going
undefined says may not be the right spot for this question, but is it currently possible to fork arbitrum to ganache? what evm version would i be using?
undefined says hello world, is there somewhere some kind of user-friendly API to push an NFT collection on arbitrum without struggling with all the programming stuff ? I'm completely lost and I don't find a *not that hard* way to create the contract and interact with it from a website
undefined says Is there any expectation of how long it will take for arbitrum fees to go down, and how low they’ll be?
undefined says It will go down till 30th september. Transaction fees are still high. And it won’t decrease until arbi launches its own coin.
undefined says @yasar I was told there’s no plan for arbitrum to have any native tokens
undefined says Arbitrum is already launched no?
undefined says Mainnet is, native token isn’t
undefined says 
undefined says Lul
undefined says hahaha
undefined says yet
undefined says Where are you seeing anything that says they’re launching a token
undefined says :monkaHmm:
undefined says @ImagineBeingAtComputers do you know anything about the fee situation?
undefined says ask admins, they know about the date
undefined says Arbitrum native token value will be between 0.7-1.2 dollars i guess
undefined says Lol
undefined says Hahaha they don’t believe me, any arbi admin is awake? Can you confirm plz
undefined says Can't speak too heavily on it. I would expect it to go down when the validator whitelist is lifted
undefined says Ah ok, didn’t know there was a whitelist still
undefined says They have announced no plans, and have explained why they do not intend to ever do such a thing multiple times
undefined says No they definitely plan to release a token valued between 0.7 and 1.2 dollars :ultraderp:
undefined says Been working on getting a running count of validators from the whitelist event. I'll post more on that when I get around to it
undefined says They announce when the whitelist is going away?
undefined says Nothing for sure yet on that front
undefined says You will regret saying all these on 30th september 🥲
undefined says Yasar definitely bought some fake arbitrum token presale
undefined says djhshshaha
undefined says I'd bet something of the lile
undefined says But if not
undefined says I will eat my shorts live
undefined says ok deal, and share a pic
undefined says when shorts are in your mouth
undefined says It’s a little disheartening to see the fees still being so high
undefined says no i didn’t
undefined says I assumed that it would be at least within a couple orders of magnitude of  say polygon fees
undefined says stake your nyancat and carbonfinance
undefined says high apr and roi causes decreasing fees also
undefined says they should keep roi lower
undefined says high roi effects tokens value in a bad way
undefined says https://medium.com/@EdFelten/there-isnt-an-arbitrum-token-and-we-don-t-expect-to-create-one-7a197c51ea72
undefined says @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs hi sonder, just wanted to draw your attention to this :colinwhut:
undefined says :smug:
undefined says ed felten doesn’t know what he says
undefined says who is ed anyway
undefined says if they won’t create a coin what’s the purpose of creating mainnet
undefined says 😀
undefined says Why would it need a coin
undefined says You need to step up your game, Ed
undefined says Who is this Ed person
undefined says For cheaper fees
undefined says Someone unimportant
undefined says Arbitrum is a layer 2 for ethereum, transactions need to use ether for fees just like on L1
undefined says He's joshin us
undefined says Or trying to get people to stake their whatever finance
undefined says i dont josh
undefined says neither don’t have any intention about it
undefined says Please don't spread misinformation. Arbitrum has no token #🧠︱faq
undefined says But you’ll have, right?
undefined says Dear Rachel
undefined says :monkaHmm:
undefined says zvex lol at your pp btw dkdj
undefined says pink octopus holding pen
undefined says Is arbitrumnews on twitter official???
undefined says Admin
undefined says This is so big influence
undefined says No it isn’t
undefined says Ok
undefined says Get it
undefined says Why arbipunks mint out so quickly
undefined says Someone know why?
undefined says A whale came up and bought %90 of it
undefined says Ohhhh
undefined says So crazy
undefined says Yeah right
undefined says Whale or team bot🍴
undefined says 💩
undefined says What in the world
undefined says i heard whale
undefined says who has arbucks?
undefined says Arbipunks last tweet is four days ago0
undefined says 😩
undefined says Mean scam?
undefined says you got one i guess
undefined says Did you buy some scam token called arbucks
undefined says 😭😭😭
undefined says Because it’s been explained that there is no arbitrum token and there never will be one
undefined says yes
undefined says @ImagineBeingAtComputers
undefined says arbucks is not a scam token
undefined says Arbpunk is not a scam, it is a great project, and, if you ask me, much better than mainnet punks
undefined says :kek:
undefined says When the erc271 bridge finish
undefined says it is not scam
undefined says I want transfer arbipunks and espunks to eth mainnet
undefined says 😋
undefined says Literally told there’s no arbitrum token by an offchain labs dev
undefined says :monkaHmm:
undefined says Some people you just can't protect
undefined says Now i just find the erc20 bridge
undefined says @crazyfire bridge.arbitrum.io has an erc20 option
undefined says Yes
undefined says why they launched their mainnet then
undefined says Need erc271
undefined says and why arbi tokens listed on cmc and gecko?
undefined says To lower the cost of computation for all
undefined says :sayori:
undefined says arbitrum has an ecosystem and it may have altcoins also
undefined says Is there any example
undefined says Contract is deploy on eth mainnet
undefined says How to use it in arbi chain
undefined says :coffepepostare:
undefined says Some code?
undefined says so you tellin me arbucks is not your ecosystem’s token?
undefined says Keep in mind
undefined says There's no token I'm afraid
undefined says I'm sorry you got scammed
undefined says Being listed on those sites does not mean the token is not a scam
undefined says And it does not make it official
undefined says If i bridge one token to another what happend
undefined says ok people i lost 20 bucks
undefined says jdjdj
undefined says The original nft token lock or burn?
undefined says :smug:
undefined says Cheaper than college
undefined says ok rachel thank you
undefined says An recreat another one in another net
undefined says ?
undefined says Need some explains
undefined says I bridged LINK to arbitrum
undefined says Will I be able to access it when link is added to arbitrum
undefined says I made a fatal error😭
undefined says link is on arbitrum
undefined says Oh maybe I’m not being patient enough
undefined says you may need to add the contract address to metamask
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/token/0xf97f4df75117a78c1a5a0dbb814af92458539fb4
undefined says Yeah I added it to my metamask already, bridge says I have it available to bridge from arb1 to L1 but it’s not appearing in my wallet
undefined says Ah I had to add arb link address
undefined says Very far left of the curve. Thanks for your help king or queen
undefined says is it possible unwrap weth if doesnt have any eth on arbitrum?
undefined says no
undefined says Hi, I'm trying to deploy a contract to mainnet, but keep getting a "gas price too low". Same code/config works fine for arbitrum-rinkeby. Any thoughts?
undefined says Here's my hardhat config. 
```
arbitrum: {
  url: "https://arbitrum-mainnet.infura.io/v3/" + process.env.INFURA_ID,
  accounts: [DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY],
  gasPrice: 30000000,
},
```
undefined says i got that sometimes... just increase the gas price tbh. hardcoding it leads to failure
undefined says I've tried different gasPrices and also to deploy via Alchemy, to rule out any issues on Infura. But no effect
undefined says that's 3 gwei, right?
undefined says yeah seems already above what is needed
undefined says Hm, no. These are in wei, right? So 30M wei = 0.03 gwei
undefined says Ok, tried again at 3 gwei, which worked! I guess the error was pretty accurate 😅
undefined says aaay anyone looking into magnetherum?
undefined says fastest way to get my eth back on mainnet?
undefined says Hi @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs , how can we verify token contract on arbiscan that were created by using  StandardErc20Gateway .
undefined says Arbiscan is run by etherscan, ask them
undefined says How do I purchase/ obtain GMX tokens as I understood I could get through uniswap v3. But gmx is not recognised token. Please help 👍

undefined says Eth adress
undefined says Admin pls help
undefined says It takes 7 days
undefined says 
undefined says Anyone knows what happened? Arbitrum TVL topped
undefined says or just error from defilama
undefined says How do I check if a service supports bridged ETH? I wanna try it on Emblem
undefined says how can i list all Arbitrum tokens via API?
undefined says i just wanna query some arb scan page to view all the arbitrum proijects
undefined says we are able to verify the  contract that deployed by us ,but not sure about token contract .
Because that is  L 2StandardArbErc20.sol ,We wan't to verify that contract
undefined says how do I run a node ? I mean to be able to make rpc requests to, docs are blank on that section
undefined says will there be an airdop for the mainnet usage?
undefined says Hi I was wondering how do I run an Arbitrum node ? I mean to be able to make rpc requests to, docs are blank on that section from offchainlabs, and I saw Alchemy supports it
undefined says Will there be airdrops?
undefined says Airdrops of what
undefined says 0x8de6783dcDdF8AEAb6D0AA92df3c1c8370950d06
undefined says its been 8 days and my eth from L2 didnt arrive to L1
undefined says have to claim it from the bridge
undefined says :arbitrum:
undefined says bumping this, is the current block gas limit capped?
undefined says i successfully got a node running. scour through my messages on support channel... somewhere there i posted a shitty step by step guide. keep in mind that i will not help further, it is not official, and you likely still need to figure out/fill in gaps on your own 🙂
undefined says hi there. how do you do that ? i dont see a claim button
undefined says its been half hour and bridge say "Unconfirmed: ETA: any minute!"
undefined says Thanks ! Any help is good
undefined says Hi devs! Anton from Opyn here. If anyone is building orderbook solution on Arbitrum, feel free to DM, we're looking for orderbook solution that's already LIVE on Aribtrum!
undefined says i actually wrote a guide and posted on medium... a few more details in there... 🤷‍♂️ 

https://medium.codylamson.com/how-to-setup-an-arbitrum-one-mainnet-node-842a4af571f7
undefined says I didnt receive my eth arbi to ethereum for 8 days. Why?
undefined says Did you claim it on the L1? Here is a helpful tutorial https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/
undefined says I already did it. But didnt receive me.
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs @fred so ,do you know how can we do it ?
undefined says hi @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hey guys, the current gas limit per block is currently around 55K. Is there any way of overriding this? If not, any advices? My contract needs around 110K of gas. Thanks!
undefined says Howdy!
undefined says Hey. Question. Is it possible to bridge across ERC-721 tokens to/from Arbitrum mainnet?
undefined says hey ho!
undefined says can you help out my friend @nogo on his query if you got the time?
undefined says i told him to come here for his dev related question
undefined says ona rbi
undefined says Beware of this scammer
undefined says 
undefined says He's no bot
undefined says But a scammer
undefined says bump on this
undefined says is it possible to split into multiple contracts?
undefined says Hi, why is Token Dai not on Json list?  I want to send Dai to the second layer but this token is not supported.  Does anyone know a solution?
undefined says @Denisa or @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs  Do you know this one ?
undefined says I want to send the custom token to L2. But when I used the bridge, I noticed that it is creating custom token contract on L2 itself. 
What I want is I want to take a full control of that L2's custom token contract. 
Is there any way to do this?

Should I make custom bridge myself to handle this kind of work?
undefined says hi everyone I got a problem when 7 days of withdraw finished>> Unconfirmed: ETA: any minute!        any idea?
undefined says Hello, does Arbitrum order transactions / blocks based on the gas paid?
We are trying to prevent front running, would it make sense to limit the amount of gas paid by users to submit a transaction to guarantee they can't front run our transactions?
undefined says Hello i've a question regarding: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas - how we actually calculate gas using web3?

`eth_Estimategas` ? i hit an error (-32000) that i didn't get on eth mainnet and trying to understand why

```
Error { code: ServerError(-32000), message: \"not enough funds for gas\", data: None }
```
undefined says Hello. I'm working on a project where we need to store and query user profile data(like gender, age, hobbies etc.) Has anyone have a similar experience developing social media dapp? I'm struggling to store queryable data, can i store those data in blockchain? Or which decentralized database would you recommend?
undefined says GM. I have a couple.of questions. 
First, is there a way to lock liquidity on arbitrum?
Second, are you able to verify contracts submitted on arbiscan?
Thank you
undefined says I am trying to deploy a masterchef contract, it will be challenging to split. Looks like it requires around 100M gas to be deployed. Any advices on such challenges?
undefined says good question. 55k arbgas seems very low tbh, are you sure its a hard cap?
undefined says guess you can wait for devs to respond, maybe try out #📬︱support idk
undefined says Thanks for your reply. The current gas limit is 55ish M. I need 110M. I'll try in the support channel
undefined says Hello. I accidentally sent ETH from ARB1 network to my Binance account. but it didn't go. what can I do
undefined says does anyone here know how to run a verifier?
undefined says hi, how long does it take to withdrawl from L2->L1 after the 7 day period? it says     Unconfirmed: ETA: any minute!   but waiting already half an hour.
undefined says you'll have to wait a little more fam
undefined says alright ^^
undefined says >1h now
undefined says has ANYONE in here actually gotten a 'claim' button to show up to claim their withdrawal?
undefined says do you know how long?
undefined says how long are you waiting JD?
undefined says like 5 hours
undefined says after waiting 8 days
undefined says @Deleted User @Boredoshi https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/889540089636585493
undefined says 55M makes a lot more sense. my bad.
undefined says how much does gas does your contract use if you try deploying on L1?
undefined says still waiting? pls tag me if you have success
undefined says yesim still waiting
undefined says awful experience
undefined says 
undefined says THE BUTTOn
undefined says HAS FINALLY APPEARED
undefined says THANK GOD
undefined says @Boredoshi
undefined says @Deleted User lool what have you done?
undefined says now you can finally buy some dips haha
undefined says patience is key
undefined says Interestingly enough gasEstimate() gave 2M on L1. Is there any reason why gas arbinet > gas l1?
undefined says very helpful guide, ty
undefined says not sure how to connect to the locally running node though. used to seeing a .ipc file from geth that i can connect to.
undefined says got it 🙂 but tbh the website should change "any minute" to "could take up to 4-8 hours"
undefined says thanks for the feedback! I definitely understand the frustration; we're looking to maybe change up the wording
undefined says Hi are the any centralized exchanges that support Arbitrum withdrawals yet?
undefined says crypto.com is one https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-app-now-supports-transfers-via-arbitrum/
undefined says great thank you
undefined says Hey are the costs in ETH on testnet the same as on mainnet? For example I deployed contracts and the total cost was 0.01 ETH on the testnet. Will it be roughly the same on mainnet?
undefined says What is the average block time on arbitrum mainnet?
undefined says whick bridge is quick
undefined says not need wait 7 days?
undefined says Because theyre trying to cap different things. Gas is a meaningless accounting unit, what matters is relative gas of different operations. L1 charges a lot more on SSTORE than arithmetic for instance, L2 charges more on anything that is to be pushed to L1 as calldata.
undefined says Is bridge.arbitrum.io  the right protocol to connect metamask for ERC-20 tokens?
undefined says 5 new tokens added to bridge today - https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmZ1nLH4bsLzxxDaosFgAkRr8YMF9HTYLTBPdY6FgVhH7o/
undefined says bump on this
undefined says Also, does Arbitrum have a `MultiCall` contract deployed anywhere as of yet?
undefined says Hey guys, do you know how much block there is in a day on Arbitrum ?
undefined says Is there a LINK token address available yet on Arbitrum Mainnet? Cannot find it here https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts/ (just available for Arbitrum Rinkeby)
undefined says This may help you https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json
undefined says Expensive contract deployment?
On arb1 I spent 0.019 ETH (58USD) to deploy an erc20 token contract (was 0.000274 ETH on rinkarby)

Trying to deploying a larger contract to **arb1** with the lowest fee...
"gas price too low" (increase gas price)
"execution ran out of gas" (increase gas limit)
"not enough funds for gas", the arb1 account has 0.03 ETH

Am I missing something between arb1 mainnet and rinkarby testnet?
undefined says Maybe your gasLimit inside truffle ? Did  you tried .estimateGas() before deployement and then set a higher limit in truffle-config ? I had similar errors and doing this helped
undefined says Guys, I am trying to deploy a contract that takes the blockNumber for deployement inside the constructor. The blockNumber at deployement was 4705356 on truffle when deployed on RinkArbi, but now when I query the blockNumberDeployement on the contract, it says 9330714 while current blocknumber is around 470700 ...

Does anyone know why is that ?
undefined says Can anyone here explain why the self-registration functions on the bridge contracts have been disabled and should we therefore request the Arbitrum team to register custom tokens?
undefined says https://offchain.medium.com/continued-path-to-decentralization-bridging-tokens-into-arbitrum-42a94b054560 "Our plan is to maintain the whitelist for the next six weeks (until October 22nd) at which point we will be opening it up and the default bridging for any assets that have not been bridged will be a Standard ERC-20."
undefined says Will you then update the GatewayRouter and your deployed CustomGateway to reenable the self registration functions? Eg the one here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x594393b6a6a46190df3e479304bbc63572c6830a#code#F1#L179
undefined says ah i'm not official but i presume that's roughly what'll happen
undefined says Ah fair, cheers anyway
undefined says any info about mainnet upgrade 8 ?
undefined says What is this?
undefined says I suspect your query is returning the arbBlock number.
undefined says bump on this
undefined says Hi Arbitrum team, yesterday i've tried to transfer ETH to Arbitrum through bridge.arbitrum.io but the transaction has failed. 
Transaction hash: 0xbbbd11eaad7f83e1dece1d8fffa9205264c30beafaa5b4bcfe1d39b0ec81b562
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x12ffd1f44dae7dc830cc6289cf39b50787d533ff94cbaa9846fd24cd906bdaa6
After 2 hours, I saw a transaction to a strange address even though I didn't make it. I don't understand what happened, Has anyone encountered the same situation as me?
If you can, please help me to review it.
Transaction hash: 0xbbbd11eaad7f83e1dece1d8fffa9205264c30beafaa5b4bcfe1d39b0ec81b562
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbbbd11eaad7f83e1dece1d8fffa9205264c30beafaa5b4bcfe1d39b0ec81b562
Thank you.

Note: 3 days ago, I transferred ETH to Arbitrum through bridge.arbitrum.io by the same way but was not problem
undefined says Hi Arbitrum team, we want to submit our app to Portal Arbitrum One and the Google form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw0U-9LcLuih5TZ_QghS-S_MS4wCKSEigA_IQEza_hFmNVow/viewform requires a Discord Invite Link, how could I get it?
undefined says The local node i built data returns null
undefined says {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":null}
undefined says Who can help analyze it? thanks
undefined says {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getTransactionByHash","params":["0x5f20ff43e91a85334d4b4d876089ab06270fd636c2d7033c2edbd51f503e2e86"],"id":3}
undefined says This is my parameter
undefined says l2 to l1 more than 7 days but how can i claim it
undefined says 
undefined says click claim
undefined says can't not claim
undefined says don't know why
undefined says I can't press that button
undefined says are you signed in on metamask on the arb1 network
undefined says oh i know why, i do not have enough the gas fee
undefined says man this was super helpful, thanks. are you part of the team ? is there any interest on making easier ? I could contribute to that, is there like a mini grant ? hah
undefined says is there any countdown?  i m waiting from 19.09.2021
undefined says and i can not see my history
undefined says did bridge changed ? seeing different ui and different contract to interact with seems suspicious
undefined says is it different contract for eth and erc20 ? might be that
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085189823266875/889985751423524894
undefined says thanks
undefined says @Mandi hey you can continue the convo here since #🔨︱ecosystem-builder-announcements is for projects showing off what they're building, not conversation haha
undefined says but you can check our docs here
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart
undefined says nope, not part of the team... was just curious and wanted to get it running. Not interested on making an easier guide or really spending any more time on that guide at all. It's more than enough for the people who really want to run it now. Otherwise offchain labs will certainly have their own guide out soon 🙂
undefined says hey! how can i run an arbitrum verifier?
undefined says Hi @hunter | Offchain Labs , pls help me this case. if I ware wrong, i need to understand to avoid next time. Thanks
undefined says Hi Arbitrum team , what is the validator base stake? and who gets the slashed stakes?
undefined says hi all. I know the gas cost for tx is ranging around $2~$10 now in Arbitrum, and i heard people saying that once we have more users on board the gas will be even cheaper.
I am aware that current speed is manually cap and will be unleash gradually.

Can anyone give me a hint how we achieve the lower gas cost when we have more users on "unlocked" Arbitrum? if yes, by what kind of order? (20%? 50%?)
undefined says Hello Arbitrum team
I am using hardhat for smart contract deployment. Can you please instruct me how to verify smart contract using hardhat on arbitrum mainnet?
undefined says Hi admin, After 7 days after withdrawing, when I claim my fund on Layer 1, will 200k gas fee be deducted on Layer 1 or deducted on Layer 2?
undefined says Where can I find the parameters of Arbitrum One? e.g. - grace period, minimum stake, etc..
undefined says hey. When i withdrawal ETH from L2 to L1. after waiting for 7days.  I still have to click to button "Claim" and must be pay fee on ETH mainnet one more.? It is so bad
undefined says how to buy Arbitrum?
undefined says Hi, if I want to extract on-chain block/transaction data from Aritrum One mainnet, what is the best way to do it?
undefined says Hi. How to become a defensive validator or watchtower validator?
undefined says I can't find the document about this.
undefined says can you dm me your situation and send me pics of your bridge page
undefined says it's pretty variable as it depends on alot of things, L1 congestion, L2 congestion, the type of tx your executing, the limits we've imposed, etc
undefined says yes
undefined says you can't there is no token
undefined says Hi folks, is the source code of the NodeInterface contract (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/rpc-utils/nodeinterface) available anywhere on Github?

I cannot find it in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/tree/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin
undefined says Deploying an ERC20 token contract costs an estimated 60 million gas. Is this normal
undefined says Depends on various factors as usual (L1 + l2 congestion for example) but deploying an ERC20 contract requires storage allocation which can get expensive
undefined says thank you
undefined says Help me understand. If no token, what’s paying the gas fee? Is it just ETH on Arbitrum then? What’s the best/cheapest/easiest way to bridge to Arbitrum please?
undefined says yes ETH
undefined says and you can visit our bridge (check out the link here #🔗︱links )
undefined says and there are alternative options as well via our portal which is also in #🔗︱links, just click on the bridge section
undefined says Thank you kindly. Sorry, last question. Is there a big difference in Gas fees between L1 and L2?
undefined says oh for sure
undefined says let me see if i can get you something... 1 sec..
undefined says there was a website comparing the fees but i cant seem to find it now lol but you can usually expect around a 10x decrease in costs
undefined says honestly depends on a variety of factors but thats just an example
undefined says is there still no valid document on setting up an Arbi full node?  tried some procedures in the internet, when starting using private build binary, I got error: fatal error: unexpected signal during runtime execution
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x2 addr=0xa00008 pc=0xd2d102].       Switch to use docker,  I got: unc":"main","line":"74","source":"arb-node.go"},{"func":"main","line":"204","source":"proc.go"},{"func":"goexit","line":"1374","source":"asm_amd64.s"}],"error":"Initial machine hash loaded from arbos.mexe doesn't match chain's initial machine hash: chain 0x541ad634cce9293e20f16e25e00ae7e4d003bfae2a9e4d24bc1c1d2db448dce6
undefined says same needs from my side. Any suggestions?
undefined says not quite yet
undefined says Is there a place to see historical gas fees on arbitrum? Like the day to day or hour by hour fees?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs okay to DM for technical issue?
undefined says Is there any good multi-sig setup already available on arbitrum? Seems gnosis needs another few weeks before they're ready.
undefined says hi anyone willing to send some eth to me for gas just to do transaction? just a small amount is ok like 0.003. after ive swapped my usdc to eth will pay you back immediately
undefined says Hi team, we are reading through the documentation and noticed this from the documentation: “If your custom token has the ability to increase its supply (i.e, mint) directly on the L2, and you want the L2-minted tokens be withdrawable back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract, it will probably require its own special gateway.”

Our utility token SPA and our stablecoin USDs falls into this category. Can someone help review this architecture?
undefined says They're currently taking requests for custom token bridge support at info@offchainlabs.com where you'll be added to a queue for support.
undefined says So if I set up a QuickStart AWS Chainlink node to be on eth mainnet, is it possible to alter that to take Arbitrum Jobs?
undefined says Hi friends, what do we need to do or who do we need to talk to in order to enable $UST (Terra Stable coin) on Arbitrum? Circulation of UST a decentralised stable coin is $2.7 billion
undefined says check general 🙂
undefined says 
undefined says I click claim (tried many times) but nothing happens
undefined says Any idea?
undefined says Are you on ethereum mainnet
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs yes
undefined says Should to use arb network?
undefined says I tried withdraw from arb to mainnet
undefined says And who TF this guy
undefined says 890892709064245298
undefined says Just a scammer
undefined says You should be on the ethereum mainnet though yes
undefined says If not try using a different browser
undefined says Hmmmmm I use metamask mobile tho
undefined says Lmk if that works
undefined says Ok, I'll wait gas down a bit 😂
undefined says any word on reliable archive node service and/or is there one I am unaware of?
undefined says hi
undefined says is there more info around how exactly the gas accounting works?
e.g. a normal ETH transfer cost me ~644k gas, what's the breakup w.r.t eth fee + arb base tx fee + arb gas usage (the last one is 0 I'm guessing)?
undefined says It's worked on my chrome. 
Claimed already. 
Thanks for your friendly respon ;)
undefined says Hi guys, trying to deploy a contract, however I'm always getting
``` "XXXXXXXX" ran out of gas (using a value you set in your network config or deployment parameters.)
   * Block limit:  56220576 (0x359dba0)
   * Gas sent:     900000000000 (0xd18c2e2800)
```
I've tried with so man different gas numbers, but nothing. Any suggestion?
undefined says on testnet I can deploy with much less gas...
undefined says Hi,when I setup one mainnet  node ,last step always getting  [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x3165d77c860b pc=0xd273e7] ，How can I solve it?
undefined says 
undefined says Hi guys, How to withdraw from l2 to l1? The website withdraw button is not responseable
undefined says Take a look at the tutorial in #🔗︱links
undefined says thanks, seem I have not enough gas fee for withdraw all eth.
undefined says Anyone know if any lending markets like (Aave & Compound) have deployed on Arbitrum yet?
undefined says I am not able figure out how to withdraw eth to mainnet. I click on withdraw and okay. nothing happens after that
undefined says Help me please
undefined says Should I leave some eth in l2 before clicking on withdraw?
undefined says same here.
undefined says Make sure you are on arb1 network when you click withdraw
undefined says And that your signed in on MetaMask
undefined says If it doesn’t work attempt to use a different browser
undefined says Tried multiple times. Not working
undefined says Submit a ticket through the pinned comment in please @jaiksgelli #📬︱support
undefined says Hello, I transferred s bunch of Eth from arbitrum to etherium network using CBWallet last Sunday. When will it arrive back in my etherium wallet?
undefined says Thanks.
undefined says Please no DMs. I don’t answer them.
undefined says I can’t believe I’m being charged over 20% of my total tokens in trying to move from arbitrum to mainnet on top of all the other fees I’ve paid and waiting 7 days. I can’t say how disappointed I am. I won’t be using arbitrum again. This isn’t a solution at all for retail.
undefined says And all I wanted to do was experiment  with it to see if I liked it. Now you’ve lost a user for life.
undefined says I’m sorry to hear that. Please note, moving on and off of Arbitrum requires Ethereum mainnet transactions that is why it is soo expensive. I’m sorry that was disappointing to you
undefined says I mean, disappointing is not the word. I was so excited about this. And it’s just more of the same. Being held hostage by insane mining fees. Small investors have no shot.
undefined says More of the same. Money goes with money. Problem mot solved. I love eth and defi and I hate broadcasting this, but I can’t get past it. It’s not democratic.
undefined says It favors the wealthy.
undefined says It’s a deeply flawed system for what it seeks to address.
undefined says And the wall to the garden is way too high for Eth to become what it could and should.
undefined says I am now buying Eth the way I buy gasoline and I know that was not what was intended. But that’s what it has become.
undefined says If you love ETH & defi then maybe staying on the L2 makes the most sense instead of going back and forth?

Also as an alternative you can always use the bridges available in our portal which are faster and likely incur a smaller gas fee
undefined says I agree the fees are high as heck on mainnet
undefined says that's why I haven't bridged off lol
undefined says 1.  There is always a need to bridge. It’s not realistic to think at this point in history an adult with responsibilities in the world  doesn’t  need to bridge between layers.  Maybe that changes in 5 years, but right now, it is what it is. I need to be able to access funds at L1
undefined says 2. Is there a solid listing of these bridges.
undefined says 3. I just think the miners have hijacked defi. I do.
undefined says Oh 100%, then use an alternative bridge if our option doesn't suit your criteria, that's all I'm saying 🙂
undefined says and you can see them here: https://portal.arbitrum.one/#bridges
undefined says MEV is real
undefined says I feel ya
undefined says I even made a video about it actually haha
undefined says Yeah. It’s really frustrating. I’m not saying they shouldn’t get paid, but the fact there is no sliding scale, based on amount you are moving on the block. They are killing off a lot of potential adoption and growth.
undefined says Well the merge should help if I remember correctly
undefined says with the higher profile MEV i mean
undefined says If you want to get money of Arb quickly, you can swap to renbtc, and then use the renbridge to bridge bitcoin to eth.
undefined says you can even release the burnt arb ren directly to the minting contract on eth, so you don't need a bitcoin wallet, takes a few hours for 6 btc confirmations, and costs 0.15% in ren fees + a bit of gas + any slippage you may pay buying/selling ren for your end asset.
undefined says Part of exploring brand new chains is navigating the bridging ecosystem...  It's always like this at first.
undefined says Hi guys,when I setup one mainnet  node ,last step always getting  [signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x3165d77c860b pc=0xd273e7] ，How can I solve it?
undefined says hi
undefined says This can change a lot sooner than 5 years. There are already CEXes accepting arbitrum deposits, if you wanna cash out.
undefined says Hello, I found this information from Bitcoin Magazine but I am not quite sure about its legitimacy: 

"Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is one of the next potential projects to airdrop its native token soon. In this article, Bitcoin Magazine will walk you through the steps to get the Arbitrum Airdrop. 
Since Ethereum gas fees are very expensive, please deposit around 10-20 USD ETH per wallet on the platform (recommended using multiple wallets to increase the bonus), and then use that money to pay into one exchange any token and leave it on when you airdrop later, come back to withdraw it,"

Is there an official announcement/information about depositing ETH and getting a higher chance of participating in a potential Arbitrum airdrop?
undefined says pretty sure thats not even bitcoin magazine, youre being scammed
undefined says Ya that’s a scam, no airdrop is happening
undefined says bumping this
went through https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas#arbgas-accounting-in-the-avm
but would love to see an example using concrete numbers...
undefined says to clarify, I'm looking for info around the gas values
i.e. eth transfer takes 21k on mainnet, but 644k here, what's the exact difference?
undefined says Which ones?
undefined says Are there alternative RPCs to Alchemy and the team ran one?
undefined says infura
undefined says Have you heard of moralis? Is it any good?
undefined says i wouldn't be a good source since I don't develop and have never used any of the above platforms haha
undefined says but they are on our portal for what it's worth 😉
undefined says Ahh. Do you have a link to the portal?
undefined says of course! #🔗︱links
undefined says okex, huobi
undefined says Nice
undefined says Your youtube channel?
undefined says Omg thanks dude for alpha. Definitely gonna try
undefined says Great when this will happen?
undefined says My brother is an eth developer. He said moralis is very friendly for developers. Appreciate what ivan is doing
undefined says Hi team, i just have small doubt. I have connected to arb1 network in my metamask. I have eth in my arbitrum l2. If I click on send eth button on metamask and try send some eth to other eth wallet
undefined says Will this actually work. Like will the eth be send to other wallet but will stay in arb l2. Or whole transaction will fail?
undefined says yup!
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs can you answer this
undefined says yeah they'll recieve it
undefined says the way i handle stuff like that when im not sure about sending
undefined says is send a small amount to test
undefined says then send the rest if it goes through lol
undefined says learned that early on in crypto 😛
undefined says Okay so i can send eth between wallets ij arbitrum right
undefined says Did you personally tried and worked?
undefined says I haven’t done it
undefined says If anything, whatever your address your sending to
undefined says Add the arb1 network on that MetaMask
undefined says So you’ll see it right away when it comes in
undefined says when what will happen?
undefined says Cex accepting arbitrum deposits
undefined says afaik okex and huobi already are
undefined says but i havent tried
undefined says Ohh
undefined says Is withdraw to arbitrum available in theese exchanges?
undefined says as per announcements yep
undefined says but like i said i havent personally tried
undefined says Ok
undefined says https://discord.gg/VbhzhJyMj9
undefined says HI, I have transferred some eth from L2 to L1 , The transaction is showing unconfirmed and a claim button is there with it , The time line is showing around 8 days, please confirm if the claim button needs to be pressed today or after 8 days
undefined says 0x6524f0d8129C929679D917B33473030C2B84C9A4
undefined says @Chris1326 after 8 days
undefined says you can also use swaps to avoid long wait. 
https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says Hello, do you have recommandation of provider to fork Arbitrum mainnet ? I encounter troubles using fork mode with hardhat via Infura and Alchemy :x
undefined says How about tenderly?

I’ve used the mainnet fork extensively and it’s very fast, but haven’t tried the arbitrum fork
undefined says Thanks in deed
I will try, if it is free 🙂
undefined says Is there something wrong with the mainnet? On Arbitrum Curve, it doesn't work and shows:
undefined says Ok the message disappeared now.. weird. 
Was there something wrong with the network?
undefined says Everything is fine on my end!
undefined says Hi i am getting this error on forking mainnet
undefined says How do transactions get from the rpc nodes to the sequencer?
undefined says Is there a way to submit transactions directly to the sequencer?
undefined says What RPC does everyone use?
undefined says https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc < im on this
undefined says I'm also getting issues on uniswap, I wonder if there's an issue /w the RPC node
undefined says Getting a no liquidity issue on eth / usdt swap
undefined says Just changed to Alchemy.. seems it's not an RPC issue
undefined says https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum

Might be related to the Graph issue
undefined says 
undefined says Any issue with bridge withdrawals? Console says 'going to get proof' but errors out saying "Outgoing message not found"
undefined says same problem. Cannot swap tokens in uniswap
undefined says https://thegraph.com/legacy-explorer/subgraph/ianlapham/uniswap-arbitrum-one?version=pending
undefined says Until this syncs I think it's gonna be unusable, I've posted in the uniswap chat too but no reply yet
undefined says If I deposit my Eth in the abritrum layer 2, will I be getting returns
undefined says I hope this is the right place to ask protocol questions... In Optimism OVM 1.0 ETH is a special ERC-20 token. Is it true that in Arbitrum it is *absolutely* the same as the L1 ETH? I mean, the fees can only be paid with it and also everyone can easily specify the `value` field for transactions and it will work seamlessly?
undefined says You can attempt to use a different dex, seems like there's liquidity on sushi @lkwtsn
undefined says yep
undefined says yes I use sushiswap. It works well
undefined says Hi, uniswap seems to be failing pool info because of some call to arbitrums bridge

"updater.ts:79 List at url https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json could not automatically update because the version bump was only PATCH/MINOR while the update had breaking changes and should have been MAJOR"
undefined says though following that link does return the json, perhaps its uniswaps issue
undefined says I was wondering , is it possible to transfer nft from L1 to L2 like an eth transfer?
undefined says Or maybe it'll ?
undefined says not at the moment my friend
undefined says Hmmm thank you 🙏
undefined says Do you guys have any idea how long it will take to get archive queries working and performing?   Days, weeks, months?  We're managing without, but trying to figure out if we should make bigger changes or keep limping along.
undefined says No ETA but the team is working on it
undefined says I'm encountering the same error
undefined says Error: processing response error (body="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": 56, \"error\": {\"code\": -32602, \"message\": \"invalid argument 1: json: cannot unmarshal hex string of odd length into Go value of type hexutil.Bytes\"}}"
undefined says Based on this github issue, the bug is on arbitrum side (?) https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/1896
undefined says can not use uniswap to swap on arbitrum, what is problem??
undefined says having a helluva time withdrawing funds.  Don't get the approval dialog in metamask.  I do when I deposit but withdraw just fails and does nothing.  Any ideas?  No prompt to approve in MM
undefined says Hi everyone, quick question, after we deposit our ETH from layer 1 to Arbitrum, can we use them on OpenSea? I am not sure if OpenSea is compatible with the ETH on Arbitrum
undefined says is arb releasing a token?
undefined says No
undefined says Everybody 🙂
It is amazing project thanks for the team
When can we buy the arbitrum tokens i am really excited 🙂
I am sad to know this project now, as i research the presale didn t happen yet. Is it true ?
undefined says Why no pending transaction I already click the claim button, but is shows no pending status.
undefined says Unfortunately no 😬
undefined says I cannot withdraw my eth from L2 to L1. How sad it is.
undefined says Are you trying to withdraw the max amount?
undefined says hi
undefined says Is there a way to submit a transaction directly to the arbitrum sequencer node?
undefined says I think your question would be best answered here https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says Thanks for the info. I've also noticed that failed transactions generally use up the same amount of gas regardless of how many computations occurred before the failure. Is this intentional?
undefined says do you have a tx to show? Could be due to the tx running out of execution gas
undefined says hello hi
undefined says ui
undefined says hi guy
undefined says So how can one run a validator node?
undefined says the instructions needs to get out pretty soon
undefined says hi, is there a mempool on arbitrum ?
undefined says a guy posted instructions on how to run an rpc node (thats not a validator) it was pretty complicated
undefined says Hi folks, doing what should be a relatively fast event log filter on a contracts takes ages using the official RPC. Is that RPC endpoint just hammered right now?
undefined says Doesn't seem to be that, it times out using the alchemy rpc endpoint. It's a contract event log filter for erc20 transfers that returns 8 results. This should be quite fast on ethereum nodes, is there some reason why this would be that much slower on Arbi?
undefined says does someone know how to check internal transactions on Arbitrum?
undefined says anyone have issues harvesting rewards on sushiswap and uniswap on arbitrum? My transactions won't go through
undefined says where has the 33% equal split USDC/ETH/BTC pool gone? was there yesteday and now my investment doesnt show up
undefined says Infura node up?
undefined says Have you contacted Infura for support
undefined says hi, i got some USDT on arbitrum, however i only got 0.0004 ETH in there, and i try to do a swap but it says insufficient gas. whilst using 1inch
undefined says I took a look here. It doesn't really explain which rpc node is linked to the sequencer node
undefined says Is the team rpc endpoint the same node as the sequencer?
undefined says Just launched: https://www.agent.com/
undefined says Guys what are your thoughts on arbidoge?
undefined says It's another low effort shitcoin.
undefined says It’s the first though which makes it special
undefined says Hey, anyone of you have an example of code of a token that gets minted (adds new supply) on Arbitrum (L2)?
undefined says Hello
undefined says Hello, I transferred from Layer 2 to Layer 1, but it did not transfer to my account, it gave an error in the second stage.
undefined says Yoooo, can I bridge from fantom or any other networks that aren’t eth?
undefined says any way to see internal transactions?
undefined says Dear All/Admin,
I would like to ask a question regarding the airdrop issue.
I and few friends of mine have send usdt to Arbitrum over the Matemask to get airdrop once it would happen.

Is it right thing to get airdrop or we are late or not for this?

If we did right is there anything to do in order to claim ?
undefined says ask the person who told you there would be an airdrop

undefined says there is no airdrop and no token
undefined says Damn…I thought there will be a airdrop 😦
undefined says nope
undefined says sorry fren
undefined says Hey. Im from cryption network and wanted to bridge over my erc20. the form says to DM arbitrum but DMs are closed can someone please help? @Arbitrum Support
undefined says the dms on twitter should be open
undefined says any further plan in releasing token
undefined says nope
undefined says Thanks. I have applied.
Can you tell me who to contact for co-marketing? @hunter | Offchain Labs
undefined says you can send an email to info@offchainlabs.com!

Just note we have a long pipeline of projects we're already coordinating with so it may take some time.
undefined says Does arbitrum one re-org often?
undefined says nope, not really possible since we're using a sequencer rn
undefined says Dear Sir, I asked for help on a different issue. can you check dm
undefined says Is there a way to see why a transaction failed?
undefined says Some of my code have revert messages but I can't see them on arbiscan
undefined says can u dm me the tx
undefined says I'm just curious to know in general how it would be done on Arbitrum. Not a specific transaction really.
undefined says usually arbiscan give's a reason why it failed
undefined says what components do I need to run a full-node?
undefined says just `arb-node-core` ?
undefined says arbitrum bridge backto eth is 8 day wait?
undefined says my funds are stuck in the bridge  it ssays 8 day waite
undefined says can i cancel?
undefined says Hi guys, I just get into Layer2 and I found the gas fee is so high now... Like $10

给 #💬︱general 发消息
undefined says what are you trying to do
undefined says Hey @everyone I’m looking for the best bridge from arbi back into Eth that doesn’t take 7 days that’s safe. Anyone have any suggestions 😕
undefined says you can take a look at our portal 🙂 #🔗︱links
undefined says there are a couple of bridges on there
undefined says Nice what’s the speed on it?
undefined says And thanks hunter 👏🏽
undefined says it's just swapping so no delay
undefined says Hi all, i'm just looking into how we can setup arbitrum infrastructure for some apps. Are there any providers like Fireblocks, Bitgo, etc that provide wallets and infrastructure already? Or otherwise is there a list of exchanges that support Arbitrum that we could use as infrastructure?
undefined says Check out the tools section in our portal #🔗︱links
undefined says Hello, do you know when uniswap chart will be available for Arbitrum ?
undefined says We're currently working on the performance of our archive nodes (which relates to this via analytics/the graph) so no ETA but expected soon
undefined says Hi how to get airdrop? if you know . pls let me know how to
undefined says there is no airdrop or token
undefined says Hi, we are many dev to encounter the following error when doing miscelanous stuff on Arbitrum fork
```
cannot unmarshal hex string of odd length into Go value of type hexutil.Bytes
```
Are you aware of that kind of bug @hunter | Offchain Labs ? Thank you very much for your feedback on it
undefined says anyone know Arbitrums chain ID?
undefined says Is it 42161?
undefined says nvm yes it is
undefined says Why are getLogs calls on arbi nodes so slow?
undefined says equivalent getLogs calls on arbi nodes take 100x the time they take against eth nodes
undefined says Hello sir
undefined says Sir I can bridge AETH L2 - ETH L1 withdraw but still not received
undefined says Is there approve before depost?
undefined says make sure to check the claim button if you already withdrew
undefined says yeah
undefined says My approve has been successed. But why my metamask has no responce when i click deposit?
undefined says And how much fee will be taken on both approval and deposit?
undefined says so from L1 to L2 right?
undefined says yes
undefined says We faced a similar issue with no metamask response after clicking deposit. You may find some useful info in the browser console. In our case the tx was aborted due to trying to call approve on the 0 address
undefined says Thanks. I know why now. There's no enough funds.
undefined says Can be improved. For approval, even there's not enough funds, the metamask can also pop up
undefined says What does 200K gas equal? trying to withdraw 2 AETH from layer 2 artibrum to layer 1; messages says have to wait 1 week and claim funds for roughly 200K gas
[7:20 AM]
Cannot seem to get this answered through customer service
undefined says Hi, this is 200K gas unit in L1. For reference, providing liquidity in Uniswap easily exceeds 200K
undefined says the monetary value would be at most 200,000 multiplies by whatever gas price is at the time
undefined says Not show claim button there
undefined says did you withdraw?
undefined says No
undefined says 0x2e09b479b7f0eb0ff09e856f2a5b119bec3fe6c4ef420cb6258ff3251a76294d
undefined says Transaction see details
undefined says you may have to explain more my friend
undefined says Do you want to withdraw?
undefined says Does the main rpc support websockets?
undefined says yes
undefined says What's happening here
undefined says I am trying to bridge a token that does not exist in the list on the bridge. Is there a way to do that? It's an regular ERC20 (using OpenZeppelin's libraries)
undefined says you won't be able to bridge any token not available on the list until later this month
undefined says Oh that's sad 😦 Thanks, we'll wait then!
undefined says will there be a token at one point?
undefined says think arb is the 1
undefined says Hey, are all tokens that are available on uniswap ethereum mainnet also tradeable on uniswap arbitrum?
undefined says I wanna ask u something can I send my eth between my account on layer 2 ?
undefined says Please use the search feature to avoid spamming this channel with the frequently asked question on whether there will be a token.
undefined says Hey I have a question about bridging tokens. I am making a no-code platform for launching tokens and am very interested in using arbitrum. The contract has some custom functionality, so it would have to be whitelisted correct? Reading this post: https://offchain.medium.com/continued-path-to-decentralization-bridging-tokens-into-arbitrum-42a94b054560 can someone clarify this statement

> Our plan is to maintain the whitelist for the next six weeks (until October 22nd) at which point we will be opening it up and the default bridging for any assets that have not been bridged will be a Standard ERC-20.

Am I correct in understanding that custom token bridging will be available after the 22nd so long as the token subscribes to the `ICustomGateway.sol` spec? The token contract is still in development so it will likely not be finalized by the 22nd.
undefined says Hey guys, im having some issues with read timeouts on the arbitrum infura rpc
undefined says was wondering if this was a known issue?
undefined says I need to add my MIM to Metamask using arbitrum
undefined says anybody?
undefined says Is it possible to add liquidity on uniswap through Arbitrum?
undefined says seems sohttps://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-arbitrum-alpha/
undefined says Hi guys, I would like to support the chain in the form of running a validator. Is there a good place where I should start? So far, unfortunately, I have not found much on this topic.

undefined says can someone help me please?
undefined says Hi, currently there is one sequencer and no mempool, will this change in future for arbitrum?
undefined says From L2 to L1, please. Ten days and still not here?？？？
undefined says ???
undefined says Over time things will become more and more decentralized as the system stabilized and we roll out updates with less restrictions
undefined says You have to claim the funds from the bridge ( press the blue button)
undefined says Do you have enough gas?
undefined says Hi how long before chainlink supports external adapters and custom API for use with Arbitrum network?
undefined says May be a question for chainlink
undefined says I asked but had no details
undefined says We need some information about upcoming exchange integrations and fiat gateway support. Okex hasn't released any news and Transak has no updates, the people want to on board from fiat directly to arbitrum, upcoming dapps need this. Some information about this would be great
undefined says it's coming fam, just know it's coming
undefined says 😉
undefined says can wait. lfgg
undefined says Hello
undefined says Please will hundred dollars suffice for a full arbitrum swap operation
undefined says What do you mean?
undefined says depends on gas price
undefined says if you're pre bridging

undefined says hello, I accidentally moved ETHs from layer 2 to BINANCE, how do I get them back?
undefined says https://medium.com/offchainlabs/interactive-fraud-proofs-arbitrums-secret-sauce-debc3b019418

hi

> If Alice’s claim covers N steps of execution, she posts two claims of size N/2 which combine to yield her initial N-step claim, then Bob picks one of Alice’s N/2-step claims to challenge. Now the size of the dispute has been cut in half. This process continues, cutting the dispute in half at each stage, until they are disagreeing about a single step of execution.

Why need this process? Why can't the user point out the step to the operator directly? I would be very glad if someone explained why what is effectively a binary search is needed
undefined says Is it possible to launch another Arbitrum fork on top of Arbitrum One?
Will it increase scalability? For Reddit Community Points for example?
undefined says Arbitrum optimizes for the normal happy case (since this is the case we're in most / hopefully all of the time). So before a challenge starts, we don't have state access to the sort of full execution trace that would let us point to a single operation; what we have are two state roots (pre and post). The interactive game is about actively narrowing down the window between state root claims until there's one operation we can point to
undefined says yes
undefined says Hi, do you know a provider that allow to fork more than the last 20 blocks ? That's super annoying to not be able to do it :x
undefined says Hey, I think we found an issue with Arbiscan. What is the best way to report it?
undefined says We deployed a contract at an address https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1cf60367d80891ecdf087d265423cb9fd044eb03 but it looks like Arbiscan fails to see it as a contract.
undefined says Thank you! I’ll let the team know
undefined says How interactively narrowing down is more efficient than narrowing down rightaway? Could you please provide code snippets from smart contracts which do the interactive proving? I am really interested, because it sounds really counterintuitive to me
undefined says im 10 cets short  for transaction, any wya to do this?
undefined says still getting this when trying to deploy on mainet
undefined says Wait for the fees on L1 to go down a bit lol
undefined says Responded to u in general
undefined says you mean to transfer more ETH to arbitrum? or do arbitrum fees go down if L1 fees go down?
undefined says or do arbitrum fees fluctuate at all?
undefined says Yeah arb fees go down if L1 goes down
undefined says oh wow interesting. Why is that?
undefined says i thought they wouldve been independent
undefined says We post call data of every tx to L1
undefined says Part of why L2 Arbitrum rollups are so secure
undefined says It looks like this is beyond Arbiscan, because our subgraph is not building and I suspect it is for the same reason. Also if that's helpful these contracts are deployed using `create2` and a template contract (using https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014). We'd love to provide any details which could help move this over the finish line!
undefined says Hey, you are seeing this because there still isn't support on Arbiscan for contracts deployed via create/create2. Working on it!
undefined says ohhh! That's a good reason 🙂 What's the best way to stay in the loop about that?
undefined says Hi folks. Does anyone know if it's possible to get the "Gas Price Paid" for a tx using ethers.js? tx.gasPaid returns the bid price, and there is no gasPaid in the tx receipt obj either
undefined says guys im short 10 cents to buy some ETH, can you please launch Arbitrum Nitro in a few hours?
undefined says Hey I wanted to know how long it takes to get the token listed. I have followed the instructions and has been over 10 days 🙂
undefined says You would need to collect them from the bridge.  did you check there?
undefined says Is that what you meant?  You bridged funds from Arbitrum to mainnet?
undefined says Hi all - I'm trying to deploy some contracts to arbitrum mainnet. I've tested the deploy script on arbitrum rinkeby and it seems to work fine. Now I get random "out of gas" issues using Infura but there are no actual transactions that I can see when checking on arbiscan.io or what not. I can't see any reversions etc.
undefined says What's wrong with this?
undefined says Then I get different errors if I use an infura RPC or the public RPC specified in the arbitrum docs
undefined says Hi all, I am running a forwarder node, trying to sync the mainnet. Running it for a while now I am getting these endless error report.

```

```
undefined says Do you know how to fix it?
undefined says `./arb-node --l1.url=<my layer1 node>`
undefined says I am running in this way
undefined says No I am the creator of CNT and i want it mapped on the bridge so we can launch our product there.
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs can you look into this one?
undefined says Cryption?
undefined says 
undefined says Anyone?
undefined says I can't be the only person that has these kind of problems. Trying to deploy using a transparent proxy, same thing worked perfectly fine on arbitrum-rinkeby (infura RPC), but is failing on arbitrum-mainnet.
undefined says ```ProviderError: execution ran out of gas```
undefined says There is obviously something different with the way that gas calculations are handled with rinkeby and mainnet. What are these?
undefined says L1 calldata is more expensive on mainnet than on rinkarby so you’ll have to provide more gas to make sure it goes through on Mainnet (L2)
undefined says I understand that the gas is more expensive, but shouldn't the gas estimator take this into account? There are no manual gas limits specified anywhere in my code. Gas estimation worked perfectly fine on rinkeby, but it seems to be out of whack for mainnet.
undefined says Additionally, it's showing execution ran out of gas, but when checking on the block explorer, there are no reverted transactions indicating an out of gas condition.
undefined says hey, when the token whitelist is removed on the 22nd, will erc721 and 1155 also become bridgeable?
undefined says the gas estimates on metamask?
undefined says technically you can already bridge it over but it's quite complicated from my understanding
undefined says I'm not deploying through metamask. I'm using hardhat to deploy an upgradeable smart contract (using hardhat-upgrades). Everything is being done using an infura RPC.
undefined says so the whitelist doesn't pertain to nfts
undefined says I've literally tested exactly the same thing using the infura rinkeby arbitrum RPC, and deployment has gone smoothly. ethers.js is doing it's own gas estimation - there are no specified gas limits in the deployment code.
undefined says As I said - there's not even a reverted transaction to show the error visible on a block explorer!
undefined says Hence the obvious question - what is the specific peculiarity that I'm obviously missing? Something has to be different...
undefined says so is there an NFT bridge in the pipeline? i'm happy to contribute and work on that if not
undefined says Not currently but if you know how to do it then feel free haha I'd be happy to support that
undefined says Hey Hunter, any update on how long it takes to get listed on the Arbitrum portal?
undefined says no time frame, and as mentioned in the application - a submission doesn't translate to a listing
undefined says just generally
undefined says You can see the bisection (really "disection")  code here. 
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/a9e914f0ffa4584f5422f47aed27f57874f1dafd/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/challenge/Challenge.sol#L148
undefined says "Narrowing down one step" would essentially reduce to executing the full state transition on chain in a single transaction, which brings with it all sorts of complications and in-efficiencies (you may find this helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxvGatp9dIE ).
undefined says Does bisection narrow down to single executions in the evm, or just single transactions in each batch?
undefined says If it's just single transactions, why can't the fraud prover just submit a merkle proof of the invalid transaction in their fraud proof and avoid the multi round part?
undefined says (and include a hash of the current state at the end of each txn)
undefined says single execution in the AVM (currently). At this level, the system doesn't need to know or care about batches (batches are just how things get submitted and ordered initially)
undefined says ^ this. In your example, the fraud prover can't post the state roots themself; they have to get the fraud committer to commit to their (invalid) state roots. This is why the interactive process is necessary; the two parties have to agree on what exactly it is they disagree on
undefined says I see
undefined says Optimism uses full transactions in their fraud proofs, right?
undefined says Is there any whitelisting required so that I can deploy a contract to arbitrum mainnet?
undefined says (not bridging a token, just straight out deploying a contract)
undefined says nope
undefined says nope, you can deploy now
undefined says literally right now
undefined says OK, well, this error is still persisting and is blocking me from doing so.
undefined says I have a standard OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract (deploying using transparent proxy), and the deploy is failing. If when trying to call estimateGas() for the unsigned getDeployTransaction(), the RPC (both Infura, and the public Arb1 RPC) are throwing 'ProviderError: execution ran out of gas'.
undefined says So it seems to be there's an error being thrown by the provider even before the transaction is actually signed and send to the RPC.
undefined says Estimategas sometimes fails especially when it is a big contract
undefined says Even those tend to get deployed however with a large enough gas limit
undefined says Well, that's the super weird thing. I tested on Arbitrum Rinkeby. On Rinkeby it was about 10.5m gas consumed to deploy. I tried setting a gas limit of over 40m, but this too still failed.
undefined says Well, that's the super weird thing. I tested on Arbitrum Rinkeby. On Rinkeby it was about 10.5m gas consumed to deploy. I tried setting a gas limit of over 40m, but this too still failed.
undefined says Arbitrum consumes a lot of arbgas so 100m to 200m can be ok
undefined says Try setting it on rinkeby to 200m
undefined says It succeeds on Rinkeby with 10.5m
undefined says It failed on mainnet at 40m
undefined says And given that the contract being deployed is upgradeable (and therefore has no constructor), it should always deploy with a relatively consistent gas consumption, yeah?
undefined says Ahh. I misunderstood. That is strange.
undefined says Yes - it's really doing my head in. Everything 100% OK on Rinkeby, then boom. No dice on mainnet.
undefined says I've also gone through, updated all the dependencies, latest versions of ethers, etc etc. Still, same error.
undefined says Gm sers

Will there be a direct withdrawal from known CEX in the near future?
undefined says The only thing I can suggest is to use a much higher limit on mainnet. It is risky though
undefined says Thanks!

getting an immediate crash when I launch the Arbitrum node
undefined says could someone point me in the right direction?
undefined says i'm pointing the arb node at a fully synced geth ethereum node `-l1.url=http://coin-node-eth-kilo-rpc.service.consul:8545`
undefined says were you ever able to solve this?
undefined says Where can I see a list of validators and their stake?
undefined says isn't it time over for arbitrum airdrop?
undefined says There’s no Arbitrum airdrop
undefined says Hey guys! I am trying to deploy arbitrum against a local ganache node. My arb and validator nodes are running but I am unable to fetch the balance of my test accounts and getting an error from arb-node saying `can't get the latest block because there are no blocks`. Any idea why there are no blocks? There should at least be a genesis block.
undefined says Hello, I joined the Arbitrum testnet. I wanted to deposit my remaining etheriums into my Binance account. But he didn't come. Can you help with this please.

Transaction number: 0x0769fd7e3a69f03ce016f9389f43e9294bba187adcb2c67d7cf3a22d4406e3d4

Address I want to send: 0xad218cf9ec499c5823d5a99171b7b3f4eb5c4664
undefined says Hey buddy, I guess that Eth is just a test token.
undefined says Probably a compatibility issue. wait for team though
undefined says Were you trying to send ETH from testnet to your binance account?
undefined says Because you can't do that
undefined says Testnet ETH is not the same as main net eth
undefined says Testnet ETH has no value
undefined says Hello who can help with technical issues deploying a smart contract on mainet ?
undefined says Is there a way for the L2 layer to read the read-only method of the L1 contract?
undefined says Hello guys, I'm doing some test with a Ganache fork of Arb mainnet. However having issues with block.number. In mainnet block.number seems to return the L1 block number, while in Ganache it returns Arb block number... Is there a way around this?
undefined says Hi. What is approx size of arbitrum archive node?
undefined says Hi, I want to develop custom Bridge for the Portis wallet.
But, it keeps reverted when trying to send contract by L1GatewayRouter.ounBoundTransfer
undefined says https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd7aced75acb9b29d4526531c7d3898ca94d2031f08261f84769cb1de1c012e12
undefined says Should I call other contract to bridge my ERC20 to L2 layer?
undefined says Is it possible to run an Arbitrum node similar to what Alchemy has?
undefined says If you have the technical know how yeah but we aren’t supporting it currently
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says There isn't an (easy) way to simply read from L1 state, but you can push arbitrary data/messages from l1 to l2
undefined says Thanks @dzack23 | Offchain Labs I’ve read through and it gives me a better understanding. So thanks!!
Now, do you have any idea how to make this work with Ganache? There is a MasterChef contract (not mine) that starts giving rewards on block xx (L1 block#) but in Ganache this will never work…
undefined says Hi is it possible for an app on arbitrum to pay all the network costs when being interacted with? Maybe some whitelist can be used to avoid attacks? But let's say a user has no ETH in their wallet, could they still interact and deposit USDC for example inside arbitrum if the platform pays the gas?
undefined says Maybe it is possible to set ganache to follow the latest block, then it may be possible
undefined says Ok cool. Just want to make sure that I would be starting from the arbitrum github
undefined says does anyone know why attempting to deploy code through the following contract does not work on arbitrum? I have a feeling it has to do with the code being submitted is EVM code rather than translated AVM code... could anyone confirm this for me?

```sol
contract ContractGenerator is Ownable {
    mapping(string => address) internal contractRegistry;

    constructor(address owner) Ownable(owner) {}

    function deploy(string calldata name, bytes memory creationCode)
        external
        onlyOwner
        returns (address create2Address)
    {
        require(
            creationCode.length != 0,
            "Create2: creationCode length is zero"
        );

        bytes memory nameBytes = bytes(name);
        bytes32 salt = keccak256(nameBytes);

        assembly {
            create2Address := create2(
                0,
                add(creationCode, 0x20),
                mload(creationCode),
                salt
            )

undefined says is the only way to get a translated version of the code without deploying it going to be to compile the mini language tools, then build something in mini itself which would convert some given code?
undefined says or is the code given to the create2 opcode above supposed to get translated somehow?
undefined says i guess very basic question is should the provided creationCode here be EVM code or AVM code?
undefined says when i run the tests on hardhat using ethereum, everything works fine... when running on arbitrum... this is not the case...
undefined says @dzack23 | Offchain Labs Would you have any suggestions on how to configure GanacheCLI so that I can properly simulate the blocktimes from L1? If that even is possible...
undefined says Check the options, I'm pretty sure theres a way to simulate the blocks as per L1
undefined says `-b --blockTime`
undefined says Amazing! Thank you!
undefined says Hi. I am trying to understand the scale of delay griefs by attackers staking on incorrect states. Here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol#delay-attacks it states that "If there are K people staking on the honest side, it will cost the attacker K stakes to buy one dispute period of delay. " Does someone know what the value of the stakes required to stake on a disputable assertion is, and how long one of the 1 attacker versus 1 (potentially) honest participant dispute periods is? Thanks!
undefined says Hey everyone, is there any information/timeline for when Arbitrum One contracts remove upgradability (or at least introduce a delay)? I think this is crucial for a trustless setup.
undefined says I think it will last for months because Arbitrum Nitro is still on the way
undefined says I feel like a delay should be added, because it doesn't remove upgradability and still makes it so users are in control of their funds
undefined says Because currently, users funds are pretty much at the whims of the developers, as I understand it the devs could just introduce an upgrade that allows them to withdraw funds of users to their own accounts
undefined says If there was a delay of a week or something, users could have the option to withdraw
undefined says Is there a plan to introduce an upgrade delay?
undefined says Yes, on the road from the current state of things to full trustlessness, there will be an "upgrade but on a delay" phase
undefined says We'll be messaging about staking requirements soon ™️  Attacker vs. honest validator gives a delay of 1 dispute period, which is 1 week
undefined says Basically since Arbitrum has full EVM compatibility, all the same tricks available  on L1 r.e. compensating gas costs (i.e., GSN, out of band minor comms, etc) are available on Arbitrum
undefined says Why wasn't this added to begin with, it doesn't seem particularly difficult
undefined says It isn't a question of technical difficulty, it's a decision of how strong we want our trusted guardrails to be and when; introducing a delay also weakens  our ability to recover from an exploit —  again, we will be minimizing the trusted layers as we gain more confidence in our system. We've tried to be as clear and open about this as possible
undefined says Ah I hadn't considered that, makes sense
undefined says Thanks! For the attacker vs honest dispute resolution, they play a game where they hone in on a point of disagreement in a logarithmic number of steps, right? So how does that work with the 1 week dispute period? Is there a fixed amount of time to react each time the other side makes an assertion, or does each party have a total of 3.5 days to be used across their actions, or something else?
undefined says each party has a total of 1 week, "chess clock style" (....which means if *both* parties are unfriendly, they can delay for 2 weeks )
undefined says What I don't understand is why Nitro gets now introduced instead of working on decentralization. Without decentralization this whole project makes no sense and the work on Nitro gives me a little bit the impression as if Offchain Labs don't want to make Arbitrum decentralized. I have seen that with so many projects, they have a technical paper about decentralization start without being fully decentralized and then introduce some user friendly stuff to satisfy the mass of users leading to having no time to work on decentralization.

Without decentralization the value of Arbitrum is 0, so why not concentrate 100% on that?
undefined says Just getting into Arbitrum Dev. Are the Arbitrum client's transaction traces exactly the same as standard Geth traces?
undefined says Hi how failed trn gets auto redeem, it is like withdrawal?
undefined says (to be sure): "auto-redeems" only apply to L1 to L2 message (aka retryable tickets). And yes, if the initial auto-redeem fails, it's analogies to withdrawals / L2 to L1 messages; any user can trigger a "retry" via an additional (signed) transaction
undefined says One thing I'm have doubts about in the messaging system is where funds need to reside for execution to go through. So,if I have a L1 address and send message to the inbox with a `msg.value` which cover the costs on L2, my L2 address doesn't need to be funded, right?

And additionally, if I send extra funds, that aren't used, do they get sent to my address in L2?
undefined says How long is the confirmation delay also?
undefined says 1) Correct, you can fund it with the L2 transaction 2) You specify a "credit back address" (our tooling, e.g. defaults to the same address on L2)
undefined says depends on which finality assumptions you're referring to 🤓
undefined says So, I'm a dev for an onchain NFT game which is currently on ethereum, but gas is pricing out  all of us. My idea is to create a mirror asset on Arbitrum that users can play with, but not freely transfer/sell. While some projects are relying on cron jobs to sync L1<->L2, I would like to use the inbox/outbox cause I don't want no server. However, I'mtrying to measure the security implication on possible messages back to ethereum
undefined says I've read that there's ~week confirmation on withdrawals, but is that necessary given that arb txs will be on trusted contracts only? Does the outbox only execute after this week period?
undefined says If could explain in more detail, or point me to some material, where I can read more about the finality assumptions, I would appreciate
undefined says Yep - outgoing messages can only be executed after 1 week, regardless of the contracts involved. This is a fundamental/unavoidable property of optimistic rollups; it's necessary to allow time for an invalid assertion to be disputed / overturned. This page here (I suppose) may be a good place to start https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/withdrawals
undefined says Got it, now I'm intrigued by this part:
> To carry out a tradable exit, a user first initializes a withdrawal; a third party — the liquidity provider — can immediately verify that the withdrawal is valid (i.e., that it will finalize eventually) by validating the Arbitrum chain. The liquidity provider then offers to buy the exit by paying the user on L1.

For ERC20, is there a way for a third party to verify that the withdrawal is valid? Do I need to run a validator node for this?
undefined says Yes, i think so
undefined says I'm trying to understand how gas accounting works, let's take https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x9a8f0cd93c15477dc15e785e8453e56ac161f44cf1e7a6ec583ac55ccaa3b741#txninfo as a random example
translating the advanced txinfo into gas values (btw, you should do this in the explorer, the ETH value is close to useless IMO):
L1 fixed cost = 460k gas
L1 calldata paid = 1175k gas
L2 computational used = 10k gas
L2 storage paid = 1200k gas
undefined says 1. what exactly is the L1 fixed cost? one of my txs from over a month ago has the same cost, so I'm guessing its just an arbitrary number but would love to know what its tracking - is it simply cost of l1 tx (21k eth gas equivalent) spread among l2 tx? assuming there was only 1 tx in the worst case, this means a factor of at least 20x
2. how is the l1 calldata paid computed? a normal transfer around the same time has a calldata cost of 184k gas, and the above tx has ~650 bytes of calldata extra, so it seems like its 184k base + ~15 gas per byte of calldata (if the method of computing is even correct)
3. computational gas is fine (only coz its negligible in the grand scheme of things 😅), though something like the ethereum yellow paper with gas costs listed would be appreciated
4. the above tx uses 6 slots, let's assume all zero to non-zero, this means 200k gas per storage slot, which is roughly 10x the gas cost on eth. Since most contract interactions are limited by storage anyway, this means the gas price shown on the explorer needs to be marked up by roughly 10x to be compared with eth gas prices, and most likely 20-50x given the other costs and txs might not actually spend that much on storage. 
5. Given this, and correct me if I'm wrong here, I estimate its currently only about 2-5x cheaper than mainnet which doesn't really seem worth it (caveat: I'll be measuring specifically for my use case later, might turn out to be much cheaper 🤷‍♂️). And this also seems like a chicken and egg problem - the cost is dependent on more activity, but more activity is not gonna come unless its significantly cheaper.
undefined says Is there a public gateway to check the status of retryabletickets?
undefined says Is there a document that can explain the ARB GAS transaction fee and the explanation document of the GAS price
undefined says Hey guys! Is there ***any*** circumstance under which a confirmed tx on arbitrum could be re-orged or even cancelled?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbgas-and-fees
undefined says you can use this little ui https://retryable-dashboard.netlify.app/
undefined says Yep - same for any txn type; just running a node to ensure the update is valid on the protocol level, and then whatever client-side check is also necessary to verify the desired action was preformed (in this case, say, a token transfer from A to B)
undefined says does it really take a week to withdraw?
undefined says security of user's funds is Serious Business (yes)
undefined says Hi all! I notice that this page is under maintenance: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain and the Truffle Arbitrum box was using the instructions there to set up our local Arbitrum network for devs. Any idea when it will be back up or where I can find these instructions now? Thanks so much!
undefined says Yes, it's for security. However, that's only on the official bridge. You can withdraw in 10 minutes using hop.exchange or cbridge.celer.network
undefined says The official bridge actually takes money out of the arbitrum smart contract, but the alternative ones use liquiity providers
undefined says (you send token to someone on arbitrum, they send you token on main net)
undefined says The lp verifies the arbitrum chain to make sure no funny busioness is going on
undefined says I read using arbitrum is safe if there is at least one honest party verifying and staking correctly. I am running Arbitrum node. How can I become this kind of honest validator?
undefined says hello everyone, I was trying to provide WETH-MIM LP on sushiswap. However I cannot sell my mim for weth. 1inch shows that there is an issue with Arbitrum right now. Anyone knows what's going on?
undefined says hi guys, someone knows about this error message?
```{'code': -32000, 'message': 'rlp: expected List'}```
trying to send a contract transaction via web3 python, same tx works on eth mainnet
undefined says This is with a select group at the moment and will be opened up later.
undefined says Hi everyone. I'm new to the discord and was hoping someone could help me out. Are there any published resources articles/videos for development on Arbitrum? I'm mostly curious if an Arbitrum contract effectively looks exactly the same as a regular L1 Ethereum smart contract or if there is any new Arbitrum specific libraries to learn. I just got started writing smart contracts and would eventually like to dig into Arbitrum but I'm not sure what the compatibility is like between the two. Thanks!
undefined says Also is there a native Arbitrum token? Or are you all just using ETH. Thanks again.
undefined says It's very similar, check out the docs -  https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart. For the nuanced differences you can watch this video from Fred and Daniel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57ROZVA41AU
undefined says There's no Arbitrum token. Arbitrum simply uses ETH.
undefined says Awesome. Thank you so much!
undefined says Is there more info, docs on it?
undefined says * Does an `estimateGas` call return more than what is expected? If so, why? And is there a multiplier to be aware of?
* Does an `getGasPrice` call return the current `gasPrice` or the `gasPriceBid`? We are seeing results that could be either at any given time.
    * For example, a call 15:20:00 UTC today return a `gasPrice` of 2.997412608 Gwei & a transaction sent at that time had a `gasBid` of approximately the same (https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xb7f2c9ea087dc78996d3b65f69a3acdf870352a5142a68d0cec1e4a37353348d)
undefined says Hey Shane, here's an answer our team uses below. Feel free to reach out if you have more questions!
undefined says "The fee market in Arbitrum works a bit differently to the L1 - it is inspired by EIP 1559 but adapted to fit the L2 requirements (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbgas-and-fees).

There is a base cost of getting your tx processed.
If demand for L2 resources are high, the base cost rises. If demand is low, it decreases.
The gas price submitted in a tx only represents the maximum you are willing to pay, the value actually charged will depend on network congestion, similar to a 2nd price auction (read more at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#price-for-arbgas).

Querying the eth_gasPrice rpc method is a reliable gas price oracle for Arbitrum, it returns the current minimal gas price to have your transaction processed."
undefined says Hi, I'm building a dApp for Arbi.  I need to query historical blocks for some of it.  Does anyone know of an API or public archive RPC endpoint?
undefined says is there a `net_peerCount` arb equivalent rpc?
undefined says to check number of peers connected
undefined says or is there no concept of peers?
undefined says could someone verify?
undefined says no peers
undefined says Some 3rd party providers are slowly adding archive support
undefined says thank you. Do you know of any of them or where I could find more information on them?
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.one/ under tools, some of the listings provide arbitrum nodes.  The most well known are Alchemy and Infura
undefined says will take a look. I appreciate it
undefined says I couldn’t find any info in the documentation - when I deploy a contract to Arbitrum, is that contract’s code stored as calldata on the L1? I saw that Arbitrum had a custom CREATE2 and perhaps part of that requires storing the code.
undefined says Are bridged ERC20 tokens assigned the same address in Arbitrum as on Etheruem. If not, is there is web-interface that shows the mapping from L1 address to L2 address?
undefined says Contract is stored on both L2 and L1
undefined says So with regards to the outbox, I see that the glossary and docs say outbox messages can be executed once confirmed. Does this mean that a L1 contract needs to call a function on the outbox to execute the message?

It looks like L1 can send messages to the inbox and they will instantly propagate to L2, but my only hesitation about jumping feet first into arb right now is that a centralized service might need to monitor the outbox and execute messages on the outbox to get data back to L1
undefined says How much will a swap transaction cost when nitro is implemented? It's about 0.0012 eth now
undefined says Is the arbitrum sequencer node different than the aggregator node?
undefined says Sequencer node is an aggregator node with special permissions to submit non-delayed transactions
undefined says 👍
undefined says When an outbox message is confirmed, any L1 account can call the outbox contract to execute the outbox message.  So you can execute your own outbox messages if you like.  Or if you can ask/hire somebody else to do it.  The key point is that once an outbox message is confirmed, nobody can stop you (or anyone else) from executing it.
undefined says If you send a tx to Arbitrum to deploy a contract, that contract's code will be in L1 calldata.  If you use CREATE or CREATE2 in a contract running on Arbitrum, the code for that new contract won't be posted on L1.   But Arbitrum supports the usual methods for getting the code of contracts.
undefined says hey all. i'm investigating L2s for a project i've built (called Fast Food Nouns). i'm curious what the transaction costs of sending an L1 -> L2 retryable ticket are.
undefined says in my use case i'd want to just send state data from L1 -> L2, so no state modifications required on the L1 side, and the processing for reading the state I'm sending are extremely simple (just `ownerOf`)
undefined says i'm asking because i'd love to read the `ownerOf` state off of ethereum with an oracle, and just have the user pay a small fee to "verify ownership" (one time) to update the state on L2
undefined says If anyone wants the answer to this question, the data is here: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/token-list-42161.json (Hat tip to my student Mahsa for answering this for me)
undefined says So L2 => L1 requires a transaction on both L2 and L1. Does L1 => L2 happen in one step? Or does it also require two separate transactions to be triggered by a user or automated service?
undefined says Yes， when depoist eth from l1 to l2，you just need to call Inbox.depositEth or other token bridge, but from l2 to l1, you need to send ArbSys.withdrawEth in l2 and Outbox.executeTransaction in l1.
undefined says $ENS -> would it be possible to bridge $ENS token to Arbitrum via https://bridge.arbitrum.io/? I guess you are approving tokens one by one? I want to deploy to Uniswap LP. I don't see $ENS yet in the list
undefined says Arbitrum has opened the bridge for every token to use without permission.May be $ENS is too new， so nobody bridge it to l2 yet.
undefined says Hey could anyone give me a rough estimate for how much the gas would cost for withdrawing eth from L2 to L1 on the L1 side? (the 200k gas warning)
undefined says hm, then some list which is used to list tokens is not yet updated, because I don't see it in the UI.
undefined says This is used for the token has been deployed on l2，but nobody did this,.The way to bridge a token is: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts#bridge-a-standard-token
undefined says It do cost around 200k gas, you can also use cbridge or others in order to save 7 day waiting(but it not as safe as official bridge).
undefined says Thanks for the reply jason. How do I calculate the Eth cost for 200k gas?
undefined says I did a bridge on Arbitrum Network from L2 to L1, in other for me to check the real time progress of the bridge, the system is saying loading pending withdrawal failed.

What do I do or should I do nothing.
undefined says Here you can view the price per gas：https://etherscan.io/gastracker
undefined says Did the fund back to your l2 address？
undefined says No
undefined says Can you give me your withdraw tx hash？
undefined says 0x5f41c189b39e4fcada042b6bfd75f090987ae5a6069c1d51658e6c88d17f3229
undefined says Now the unconfirmed info showing estimated time to claim is not showing rather saying loading pending withdrawal failed.


Please let the team fix it
undefined says Okay，you can keep waiting and you can claim the funds on l1.
undefined says Okay sir
undefined says Hi team, I am also facing the same issue now. Can you please help me out as well? 🙏
undefined says This is the transaction has for my L2 to L1 bridge on Arbitrum: 0xd52cb3f16bfe3f93fdbcfb2917ca2d84244967c58fac0e98fc779b031131f720
undefined says Is there anything else that I need to do? I can't see the unconfirmed information either
undefined says It just shows: Loading pending withdrawals failed
undefined says Hi all, we are aware of the issue with DOE and are currently investigating.
undefined says Please be aware that this is a community-bridged token and only interact with it after due diligence.
undefined says Let’s suppose that one day Arbitrum One shuts down. Is there anything stopping the community from starting a new Arbitrum network that loads its state from the L1 call data and continues working as if nothing changed? That seems like a nicer approach than everyone using the escape hatch.
undefined says any guesses at when this might be updated? https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain
undefined says local development seems pretty critical
undefined says unless rinkeby deploys are cheaper on arbitrum i suppose
undefined says You'd need to collateralize the second network. Thankfully though that'll never be necessary 🙂
undefined says they don't (by default) get the same l1/l2 addresses; easiest way to check the mapping is via the https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ (paste the L1 token address in)
undefined says Awesome. For custom token bridging, I was thinking that I would lock my token a contract I deploy on L1, then send a retryable ticket with calldata which gets passed to call a function with parameters on the contract specified by the destination address. Users can do some stuff on L2, then they send a message with .sendTxToL1 to finally withdraw with execute. Just want to confirm that this pattern is consistent with what Arbitrum can do / allows developers to do before I go neck deep into development
undefined says so much
undefined says Yep, sounds like you have the right idea (to be sure: the token bridge we implemented has the architecture to do this w/ an L1 token already, so it's not as tho you need to handroll a token bridging system from scratch https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets)
undefined says I'm doing this with an ERC721 that will need to move a good bit of data between layers, so I'm going to have to handroll a little bit.
undefined says ah i see
undefined says One last newbie question then I think I'm set to start testing what I've built...

I need to verify that only the L1 contract may create retriable tickets to execute functions on L2 and vice versa. From what I can tell, msg.sender will resolve to the L2 gateway for L1=>L2 messages, and it will resolve to the outbox for L2=>L1 messages.

I'm thinking I can cryptographically sign the calldata I pass with my messages and verify the signatures on either end. Is there a more graceful approach baked in?
undefined says The outbox has a method which returns the L2 sender.
undefined says And arbsys has methods to verify if a caller was aliased, and de-alias them
undefined says See @skellet0r's answer — you should have sufficient checks that way; shouldn't need to be cryptographically signing calldata
undefined says Excellent. Thank you very much!
undefined says Hi! I would like to build a connection between L1 and L2 that will send Eth from the smart contract on L1 to the smart contract on L2 automatically. So one will be able to deposit Eth on a smart-contract placed on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract should also have a function that, when called, will automatically send all the deposited Eth to the L1-L2 bridge/gateway, and from there it will go to the smart contract located on L2. Is it possible to do this? For user-user transfer it is quite straight forward, you just call depositEth on Inbox contract, but how about contract-contract transfers?
undefined says If one wanted to create an ENS/ETH pool on Arbitrum, how would one do that? Is it possible?
undefined says like you would any other pool on uniswap
undefined says its similar to adding liquidity
undefined says so, if i want to use arbitrum on uniswap for example. will all the tokens available on uniswap be available on the arbitrum layer?
undefined says No. Only tokens that have been bridged to Arbitrum, or have been created on Arbitrum, are possible to swap on Uniswap - assuming there is liquidity.
undefined says Similar - see the createRetryableTicket method on the inbox contract / these tutorials https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter
undefined says @dzack23 | Offchain Labs thank you
undefined says Hi guys, in the documentation, there is a part which talks about staking deadlines. Does anyone know how long the staking deadline is?
undefined says Dear Admin, we are a GameFi project built on ETH. We had successfully launched our 1st round NFT mint, and we are planning to migrate to Arbitrum in December. Is there any way to have an official collaboration in any form, e.g., community sharing and co-building the NFT GameFi ecosystem on arbitrum? Who should I contact with? Our project is: openblox.io
undefined says Hi quick question. If i have a smart contract on arbitrum network theres no way to call smart contract functions hosted on ethereum is there?

For example if compound isnt on arbitrum then theres no way for me to read the storage variables in compound smart contracts is there?
undefined says I understand that on Arbitrum the beauity is that I can always exit to L1 if Arbitrum were to go down. How would that work if I put my tokens in a contract? It seems impossible to interact with those funds if Arbitrum were to go down. Is that correct?
undefined says @Arbitrum Support I'm working on some contracts using the retryable tickets almost 1:1 as they appear in the greeter demo. I'm encountering errors saying "not enough gas for immediate redemption" on the attempt to redeem after the ticket creation call on L2 succeeds. The only difference of note is the length of the data passed in as the 8th parameter while creating the retryable ticket, and I'm manually entering gas estimates in while calling functions on my contract (but I'm far exceeding the numbers required to call my target function on L2 when I make those calls directly against the target contract)

Are there any other examples I can look at for retryables to see what I might be doing wrong? Is there anyone that I can email or hop on a call with to help diagnose this with some transaction IDs and some cursory review of the code I'm using to create the retryable tickets?
undefined says @dzack23 | Offchain Labs would be best to help here when he has some time.
undefined says Hi guys... does the arbitrum bridge sill have a 1 week delay?
undefined says From l2 to l1，it does.
undefined says @Arbitrum Support  I'm trying to submit a withdraw from L2 to L1, but although I click the withdraw button for many times, the metamask didn't respond to this and have the window for me to submit the transaction. (the interact with the other smart contract is ok as I just tried with uniswap-Arbitrum). Is this a system issue? Can you help?
undefined says Btw, there is no blocked transaction in line.
undefined says Do I need to wait until 7 days later and come back? It doesn't look like the right way though. As when I operate in V1, it asked me to approve a transaction...
undefined says Hi all - i'm looking to derive the transaction fee from the Gas Limit, Gas Used, and Gas Price Bid on arbiscan. Does anyone know the correct formula to use?

this is the txn used in the image as a reference:  
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x0882a6119aac9d0d95fe44f2a8149b1976e743111b3a63ef45f44816e717f0aa
undefined says Gas used by transaction * gas price paid
undefined says You can calculate by this way:gas_used * gas_paid
undefined says Can you use another browser to try this again?
undefined says Ok thanks
undefined says @Arbitrum Support , I have a question about the scope of the Bug Bounty program on Immunefi and was told to ask here.
Would bugs requiring validator access be in scope? I know that currently validators are whitelisted, yet they're meant to be trustless eventually and the fraud proof part is there and confusingly listed as in-scope on the Immunefi page.
But does it mean that "trustless" part is complete, or maybe it's not meant to be complete yet hence I shouldn't research that?
I ask because I'd want to avoid a case where I put my effort into researching something that's not yet meant to be secure and is just incomplete...
undefined says Spoke with the team, I think you might be better off speaking with Immunify for clarification
undefined says Will the nitro upgrade contribute to reducing fees? If so, to which degree?
undefined says It will to a certain extent, but no hard numbers
undefined says https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-sneak-preview-44550d9054f5
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @bobafetador  Thanks guys - the reason I haven't referred to Gas Price Paid in the question is that the API on arbiscan returns Gas Price Bid for their gasPrice column. This is also the case on the arbitrum uniswap subgraph 'https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/ianlapham/arbitrum-minimal'

Do you guys know an easy way to pull the transaction fees or gas price paid to do the calculation?
undefined says oh that's surprising but I'll try asking them. IMO they should implement something like "scope questions"
undefined says Still nothing regarding retryable ticket documentation and troubleshooting suggestions?
undefined says hey all, have a hopefully basic question - In my wallet I currently have 
AETH and WETH. 
is AETH just arbitrum's version of ETH (I assume yes).
undefined says If I swap the WETH to ETH via curve - will that automatically become AETH ?
undefined says Need a little more gas to complete a bigger TX so fingers crossed this works, else i'll need to bridge more eth -_-
undefined says Yup that’s right. Arbitrum uses native ETH for gas and in some places it is referred to as AETH
undefined says whew ok great thanks so much
undefined says my tx will be saved ❤️
undefined says Sorry，we can not get the exact transaction fee before the tx has accepted，so the gas price bid is used to be the maximum acceptable price，if you think it is too high，you can lower it down.
undefined says Hey! I try to build arb-avm-cpp Golang project. Got err: 
```

apt install libmpfr-dev
```
undefined says Yo - beyond the greeter example, I can point you to the the contract / client side tooling around token deposits for a more robust example (that one uses the estimateRetryableTicket method in our precompile to figure out required maxGas); feel free to DM me w/ txns and/or code, I can take a look
undefined says Sent a friend request so I can DM you. I'll forward some code along
undefined says Hi everyone, just wanted to ask if chainlink nodes can connect to arbitrum and run external adapters, external initiators etc.
undefined says FWIW here is a rundown of how to build external adapters using Chainlink. However, with regards to Arbitrum specifically, I'd suggesting visiting the CL Discord and asking in #external-adapters: https://blog.chain.link/build-and-use-external-adapters/
undefined says https://discord.com/invite/aSK4zew
undefined says Will sequencer still be used in Nitro or multiple sequencers?
undefined says Is there a place where I can see all supported RPC functions for arbitrum nodes? I've been trying to search through the github but have been unable to find an actual list. Things like eth_blockNumber etc
undefined says Basically looking for https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4117254/ethereum-json-rpc/RVu7CT5J#intro but for AVM compatible methods, specifically I see a getSnapshot method in the node repo, but I've tried evm_snapshot, avm_snapshot, and eth_snapshot all to no avail from web3
undefined says the sequencer
undefined says hey there! does anybody know if the arbitrum rinkeby inbox/outbox should work as the docs indicate? i'm having some issues having calls executed on the L2 side.
undefined says and my rinkeby eth deposited isn't falling back into my L2 wallet as described. i'm also seeing this bridge the eth is going through has a ton of eth in it.
undefined says 
undefined says which makes me think it's not working
undefined says (actuall scratch this last bit, i suppose it makes sense that bridged eth gets kept in this contract)
undefined says this seems to be the failed ArbRetryableTx.sol txn: https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0x3399147b9ff321072c6f82226fd98368ce41ab57f3c9987635666701362ae036
undefined says Can you give me your l1 inbox tx hash?
undefined says Yes definitely, here’s one: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x334cdd76ecb5e5979edca160cd6d4db17c5f1ced70d2727203547fe54ccce8f1
undefined says Sorry, i did not get any log data from the l2 transaction,  I will reply to you after asking the engineer team.
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says happy to help
undefined says I can send code if needed too
undefined says Hello, the reason why your l2 tx was reverted is you need to address aliasing, here is the reason: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing
undefined says And you can use this library to do this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/libraries/AddressAliasHelper.sol
undefined says If the msg.sender is contract, the target address will change, so you need to change it in advance when you call the inbox contract.
undefined says Hi All, I'm looking to buy OHM on Arb, If I transfer ETH from ETH network to Arbitrum network, then swap it for OHM, does that help me on Olympus? Does the dapp need to support the Arbitrum network to be able to take advantage of swapped tokens?
undefined says Hi! Okay great easy fix, thank you. I think it’s worth putting this contract specific bit in the docs, because I think they explicitly say you don’t need to alias from l1 to l2
undefined says Thanks for your advice
undefined says thanks for your help!
undefined says has anybody observed transactions on arbitrum that have a much higher gas cost (in terms of units of gas) than a comparable call on ethereum? https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0x82bc347e33f519b97050e9f7642c2f392717a0f6178f3ae9637c30797914dd97
undefined says this call is costing around 38 million in gas. but a comparable call on ethereum costs about 400k.
undefined says not sure where that massive discrepency is coming from
undefined says ArbGas != ETH Gas 🙂
undefined says ahh okay! but when i see a gas price listed like here: https://cointool.app/gasPrice/arb
undefined says i can still multiple eth * units to get a final expected cost on mainnet right?
undefined says in this case say 1.5 gwei, it would be 38,000,000 * 0.0000000015 = .057 eth
undefined says anyone having issue with RPC?  I am getting (from today on) "29 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc. contract: 0xFF970A61A04b1cA14834A43f5dE4533eBDDB5CC8, func: balanceOf, :w3: <web3.main.Web3 object at 0x7f55750c5370>:". Previously there were no problems
undefined says Are there any explicit instructions on how to move ETH from L1 to L2 over the bridge? 🤔 I'm on the Arbitrum network in Metamask at bridge.arbitrum.io.
undefined says and when running a local node with docker - what i am doing wrong here, i am getting this msgs  - "failed to start inbox reader, waiting and retrying"
undefined says There seems to be some problems with rpc, we are fixing it
undefined says This website may not use gwei as unit, in your tx hash the actual gas price is 0.01gwei.
undefined says yes i see this, but i'm curious if this is the same i can expect on arbitrum mainnet? the txn i sent is arbitrum rinkeby. i just know on ethereum mainnet and rinkeby gas prices differ.
undefined says scratch that, i guess i can just pull random txns on mainnet arb and see
undefined says thanks!
undefined says Sorry, I don’t aware you are using test net.
undefined says In arbirtrum one, it’s true. But it depends on what type tx you send, your tx is complete, so the gas used is high.
undefined says i'm not sure what you mean by the tx is complete so the gas is high. wouldn't all transactions be completed?
undefined says i'm a bit concerned, this nets out to about .03 eth for this kind of transaction, which is much more than i expected
undefined says it's a lot cheaper than on ethereum, but not by as big a factor as i was hoping for
undefined says Sorry,it is complex, there is a problem with my input method association
undefined says ah i see, yes there's a lot of data involved. thanks!
undefined says My pleasure
undefined says can anybody, tell me what is the current phase of arbitrum ?
undefined says arbitum is in its alpha phase or beta ?
undefined says beta
undefined says look at #🧠︱faq
undefined says Ok. But how many days it will stay in beta approximately?
undefined says no time line
undefined says as long as we're still making upgrades to the system it'll be in beta
undefined says Can a smart contract deployed on Arbitrum read state (balances on a ERC20 contract) on L1?
undefined says OK, please let us know, when you will have fix
undefined says not directly, but you can have a contract push data up to L2 as needed via l1tol2messages https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says ...or you can do proofs in l2 against the l1 state if ya wanna get real jazzy
undefined says (not recommended)
undefined says Interesting
undefined says hi
undefined says Can I call https://etherscan.io/address/0x51de512aa5dfb02143a91c6f772261623ae64564 this address directly with a properly encoded transaction and execute a transaction that way?
undefined says Or rather what would be the path to execute a rollup transaction from L1?
undefined says 0.03 ETH is IMO high, what kind of transaction it is ?
undefined says Hi guys, Does the block.timestamp opcode on arbitrum return the l1 timestamp
undefined says it will return a value close to (but not necessarily exactly) the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction. https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says $9 for an approval… is that right?
undefined says Is there any documentation anywhere on using Metamask and Arbitrum?
undefined says This is just a bid price, however it will cost much less than this.
undefined says … ended up being $8. Seems a long way from the proclaimed 20-50x reduction in fees compared to eth mainnet🤨
undefined says Hey, Where I can I find out about Arbitrum Testnets and appropriate RPCs?
undefined says Does Arbitrum still have the Kovan test network?
undefined says Also, can anyone tell me if https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/arb-validator/tags is up to date?
undefined says Or is there a docker-compose I can use to simulate an entire Arbitrum blockchain?
undefined says Here you can use https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says I think both optimism and arbitrum's advantage are for complex logic(i.e. the more gas needed, the more saving we are going to see, as the L1 cost is more or less constant) but agree that the 'saving' seems to be over-hyped.
undefined says How many validators are there currently running on the Arbitrum mainnet? Is there a place where we can see this?
undefined says I hope I don’t sound like a weeb....I told people that technology like this would exist and they looked at me like I was crazy ...THIS IS AMAZING!
undefined says Now only offchainlabs is running validator, but we will open registration later
undefined says Hey. New in town - just sent eth across to Arb, worked sweet as a nut and quick too (less than a minute)! Used Hop Exchange to send from Arb, and also withdrew from Arb back to Mainnet - showing it will take 8 days to complete. Is that timeframe still accurate? TIA
undefined says Repost :

Hey guys is there somewhere I can find out more abt Currnt arbitrum stats? Eg tvl, total active users, number of ppl use bridged etc?
undefined says If you use cbirdge hop or across, it won't take so long.
undefined says https://ethhole.link/project/Arbitrum%20One
undefined says you can try this.
undefined says Curious... What's the diff btwn eth Bridge, erc20 gateway and other gateway?

Is this just... 
Pure eth Bridging
Erc20 token bridging
Other token bridging (thats unljkely ?)
undefined says Maybe you want to ask the diff between arbitrum bridge and other third part bridge, arbitrum bridge is the most safe one but it will take 7 days from l2 to l1, while others will arrive instantly.
undefined says Hmm so how do I read the Info in the link.. Eg I went to the explorer link in it and we are at block ~3.3m (each block contains 1 trxn) . Does this mean there's 3.3m users who bridge across to arbitrum via the bridge?
undefined says Sry I'm new to l2 and confused af 😢
undefined says All I want To figure out is total number of users who bridged asset across to arbitrum
undefined says No, the block is arbitrum's network state, it has nothing to do with bridge. This website has tvl information and you can also vist debank, defillama or l2beats to get more information.
undefined says Ahh okay let me hit those Web and checkk..
undefined says here has the number of accounts on arbitrum:https://arbiscan.io/accounts
undefined says Thx..will check it out...
undefined says so it is still not a trustless model, even when you open it for registration ?
undefined says You can also run a node and get the rollups state by yourself.
undefined says And if you run your node honestly, you will always get correct state.
undefined says thanks. that is what puzzle me. a validator is kind of like a 'miner' in the L1 sense so it can submit/attest transaction if I understand it right. how are bad actors handled in this case ?
undefined says I am starting up a validator in rinkeby and trying to test it out(it took almost a week, seems to be depending on CPU speed)
undefined says Node != validator, and every tx on l2 will have calldata logged on l1, node is used to read the calldata on l1 and compute those then get the latest state of l2. Validator also has those functions but it will combine those state and generate rollups block, you can get the state from validators/others node or you can run your own node to get state.if a validator cheat and be challenged by others, the validator will lose stake.
undefined says then how can I start a 'validator' ? so a node is more like a 'read-only' geth that broadcast the transaction ? the reason I ask is I am presented with the question of 'the L2 data are logged on L1, what if no one runs a validator, i.e. the chain is abandoned, can we still run a validator to maintain it, for whatever reason'
undefined says If a validator is abandoned, it won’t affect the l2’s consequences(the rollup protocol doesn’t decide what the chain will do but merely confirms the correct behavior that is fully determined by the inbox messages).
undefined says Here is how to run a node: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says now I am even more confused, I am starting a node but is it a 'validator' ? and when I said 'abandoned', I mean the chain(i.e. no validator or sequencer). In the case of L1 POW, anyone can start a miner in this case and the chain can continue, what would be the equivalent in L2 arbitrum ? and yes, I am 'syncing' the rinkeby network, it is now around Oct 31, still another month or so to go to have it fully sync
undefined says this is what I have right now
undefined says Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!

instance: arb-rpc-node/v0.8.0
at block: 6719315 (Mon Nov 15 2021 19:24:29 GMT-0800 (PST))
 modules: arb:1.0 eth:1.0 net:1.0 personal:1.0 rpc:1.0 web3:1.0
undefined says No, you are just starting node, not a validator.And arbitrum is not a blockchain, it’s just a rollups network, so there is no miner on arbitrum.
undefined says If the sequencer or validators are offline, the l2 network can still keep running because you can send tx to l1 inbox(where the l2’s calldata go to), and if you are running a node, you can still get the latest state by read the inbox.
undefined says so how can I run a validator so I can 'rollup' ? I know there is no 'miner', I use that term as a equivalent. functional wise, when I submit a transaction on L2, that still needs to be 'processed'(or rollup). and that is the role of a 'validator' ?
undefined says When u send a tx on l2, it will go to the sequencer and the sequencer will compute your request and send back the outcome to you, when the sequencer get enough tx,it will send those tx to l1 inbox.
undefined says yes, that is exactly my question, what if the sequencer is down or 'abandoned' ? who is going to compute the tx ?
undefined says You can read this article: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says If the sequencer is down, you can still send tx calldata to l1 inbox by yourself
undefined says I have already read that and why I have the questions
undefined says yes but who is 'executing' the tx code ? say I send 2 ETH on L2, how is that being 'executed' if the sequencer is down ?
undefined says The security of l2 is based on l1.We have sequencer and full node is just help us to use l2 more convenient.
undefined says The full node , sequencer and the validator.
undefined says I am not talking about security, I know it is recorded on L1. but can anyone run a 'validator' and process it ?
undefined says you said I am not running a validator nor full node so I am depending on someone to process it, correct ?
undefined says in the case of optimism, I know they are the 'only sequencer' so if they stop the whole thing stop
undefined says You are relying on someone else to process it. The question then becomes - if the validator refuses to process your transaction, can you submit a block to the L1 contract or at least perform a forced exit.
undefined says That doc is used to run a fullnode.
undefined says that is exactly my question
undefined says so I am running a full node and can process tx right there ?
undefined says Sure.
undefined says Last I heard, Arbitrum’s validator is currently the only entity that can submit blocks to L1 and that forced exits (exodus) won’t work until they remove the validator whitelist. Is that not the case?
undefined says if the block is rollup block, it does. But if you mean tx, it is no, the sequencer will submit tx to l1(instantly get outcome) and the user can also submit tx to l1.Validator is just used to confirm the outcomes.(validator or rollup protocol doesn’t decide the results of transactions, it only confirms the results.).
undefined says So if the validator was censoring me and I submitted my exit to L1, the validator would either ignore it or confirm it on L2. Either way, I have my assets, but if they ignore the L1 transaction, they’ve created invalid state in L2 that other full nodes would refuse (and at some point Thant validator would be punished whenever the protocol implements that). Is that correct?
undefined says so in a hypothetical scenario, my full node is the only node running for abritrum L2 and I submit a ETH transfer(L2 to address A), this would be process by my node with the data logged to L1, who is paying the L1 gas ? I don't see anything in setting up the node about this ? would it be the same tx sender of the L2 tx ?
undefined says If validator ignore your tx, there will be a fraud proof challenge happen, and the validator will eventually lose the challenge.So your state will eventually come back and the validator will lose its stake.
undefined says The user who send tx will pay this.Moreover in sequeencer mode, we can send the tx to sequencer.And if in non-sequencer mode, if you are a aggregator, you can send batch tx gathered from users, but if you are not a aggregator (just a normal full node), you'd better just watch the network/compute the tx and provide rpc service for others.
undefined says yes, I see the the node is running in 'forwarder' which I think is basically 'relay' to some other nodes that process the tx. though as I said, I need to understand the 'what if' scenario. but how can the user pay the L1 gas ? they are not signing the L1 tx
undefined says from L1 perspective, whoever send me something, it needs to be signed and the signer must have enough ETH to pay the gas. in the sequencer mode, obviously the sequencer address would be the L1 sender(and it aggregator multiple tx on L2 and submit to L1, as a form of log)
undefined says If the user just send tx to you but no l1 gas fee, you have the right to reject it.
undefined says And l1 fee will be deducted from their l2 account
undefined says but I am operation on L2, what has the L1 fee anythign to do with it ?
undefined says and what is the sender address(on L1) for the calldata that got logged ?
undefined says Here is an example, there is l1 fixed fee and l1 calldata paid:https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x8a1552c886718af65d67ef41e4e49f0ff77f74e5b7ff00024f7330e01f60d23b#txninfo
undefined says Just the sender's address, not the one who send batch tx.
undefined says ??? how can that happen ? say I am writing a dapp with a simple send ETH(but the rpc is actually L2 abritrum), me as a user just sign it of 'send 2 ETH to X', I am not signing of 'log these data to the L1 contract of abrbitrum', how can I be paying the L1 fee ?
undefined says Every data logged on l1 will include L2 caller.
undefined says yes, that I can understand but the sender of the L1 tx cannot be the same L2 caller as it is not signed in that form ?
undefined says again pulling up optimism, they only charge L2 fee which is a combination of L2 + L1 and all transactions on L1 for their rollup are from specific address of their sequencer
undefined says The arbitrum network will charge your l1 handling fee and compensate the sequencer or aggregator.
undefined says Your gas fee on arbitrum will both include l1 fee and l2 fee.
undefined says yes, that is how it works but as I said, in my hypothetical situation, I am the only node running, where do I setup what address used to send to L1 inbox ?
undefined says Everyone can send tx to l1 inbox.Did i misunderstand what you mean?
undefined says yes but I am working in the context of L2(as an end user), I don't send tx directly to l1 I send tx to L2 as a 'normal sol call' and only sign that which also has the chain id included
undefined says may be I ask it the other way, can you tell me the L1 contract address of the inbox so I can check it on etherscan ?
undefined says inbox: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f
undefined says sequencer inbox: https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c6f947ae67f572afa4ae0730947de7c874f95ef
undefined says looking at the sequencer inbox, everything is from the sequencer which is basically what I understand. so I thought my 'node'(or validator') would need to setup in similar way ? I know currently A One is running in sequencer mode(and it is fine) but I just need to know if I am not relying on the sequencer, what needs to be done so my L2 tx can continue to be process, i.e. say my L2 balance/smart contract will continue to work.
undefined says the Arbitrum: Inbox I can only see the L1 -> L2 tx(say transfer ETH to Arbitrum), not about the L2 tx logs(calldata)
undefined says Your full node will automatically read the inbox and perform calculations to get the latest state.
undefined says no, what I mean is assuming there is no other sequencer/validator running, what can I do ?
undefined says I think more people will choose to send messages directly to l1 when the sequencer is dropped or the contract is called across layers.
undefined says We currently have no open decentralized sequencer.
undefined says so basically it is the same as optimism in that if your sequencer stopped, the whole L2 is stalled ?
undefined says We have inbox and if user send tx to inbox by theirself, the network still online.You can still have a full node to get the latest state.
undefined says but how to 'create' the latest state(assuming you mean state of L2) and send it to L1 inbox ?
undefined says say in Block 1(L2), I have 2 ETH. I send 1 to another address, this is a tx that needs to be processed(on L2), without the sequencer, who process this and create the 'latest state' ?
undefined says full node will read inbox's calldate, with those calldata, the full node can continue to calculate on the original state to obtain the latest state.
undefined says yes but who is advancing the state as you said it is either sequencer or validator that can do it and nothing is running. I am only running a 'full-node' which is like a 'read-only' node. and without someone to advance the state, isn't the whole thing stalled ?
undefined says All the node will advance the state, they all compute it.As I said before, full node will keep reading inbox’s calldata and compute them to get the latest state.(Active validator will confirm the state by staking, if other node think the active compute the wrong state, they will challenge.)
undefined says ok, then I get back to my question, who put that calldata on L1(such that all other nodes can read that). It cannot be the end user account which I am like 100%, say the end user is using metamask pointing to my 8547 endpoint to do a simple ETH transfer
undefined says putting the calldata on L1 is to me the equivalent of 'making a new block to include the tx'
undefined says Both sequencer and user can put.(sequencer mode)
undefined says no I said when the sequencer is down.
undefined says and when you said user, I just described, the user is interacting with metamask
undefined says doing simple ETH sending on L2, it is not interacting with L1
undefined says When sequencer is down, user can put it.
undefined says how ?
undefined says they write they own dapp to put it on L1 ?
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f#writeProxyContract
undefined says This inbox contract I sent you last time, there are other functions user can call, not only deposit.
undefined says yes this is just the inbox, how can the user translate their L2 function call, against an L2 contract address into these 'message' ? you are effectively tell me the end user(or dapp) is recreating Arbitrum engine in order to replace the sequencer functionalities.
undefined says then why don't I just run my own sequencer ?
undefined says No, this is not replace.You run a full node is used for you don’t trust other full node’s state, so you can set up a state and compute by yourself to get the latest state.
undefined says Here is how the message delivery: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says I see the sendUnsignedTransaction, is that what is needed if I want to 'execute a L2 transaction' ?
undefined says but if it is unsigned, how would the 'send ETH from address A to B on L2' works as that needs address A to sign the 'L2 transaction' ?
undefined says Inbox.sendL2Message
undefined says yeah, then that is basically I have to recreate/replace the functionality to 'package the data' as blob which would be executed on L2 ?
undefined says and my node(let's say the only node running for L2) would pick this up, execute it and get the latest state ?
undefined says locally
undefined says yes
undefined says This docs is really worth reading: Here is how the message delivery: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says so effectively, I do have to create the messageData(which is basically the L2 execution blob), then why I can't I just run my own sequencer which would be doing this, instead of rewriting the whole thing again ?
undefined says Sequencer is now only holding by the team.
undefined says yes, I can understand that as that controls the order of execution which has a direct impact on the state. But I am talking about a hypothetical scenario where the team said 'we want to move on'(not saying it will happen). This happens say in ethereum where someone want to stay with 'classic'. In that scenario, can't I just run my own 'sequencer'(which effectively is the miner equivalent) ?
undefined says I am purely looking at it from a technical perspective, given that this is about protocol 🙂
undefined says If all node is down(include sequencer and validator),you can play a role as the only part in this network, you can act as a aggregator to help user send tx(aggregator!=sequencer), and you can read tx from inbox to generate the latest state.
undefined says If you are a sequencer, you can do the thing as you said.
undefined says yes but still I need some 'apps'(in the L1 perspective, which function the same as the sequencer) in order to create the messageData and write it to the L1 inbox ?
undefined says if you know the encode of the tx message , you can send by yourself, or you may need a script to help you send tx to inbox.
undefined says which is effectively re-implement the sequencer 🙂
undefined says BTW, how are you controlling only Offchain Lab can run the sequencer ?
undefined says The team have not opened the registration.
undefined says so it is still controlled somewhere in the contract on L1 or L2 ?
undefined says my local node on rinkeby is now fully sync, I can start my testing 🙂
undefined says wow but it takes up 26G resident memory, that is a lot
undefined says caching everything ?
undefined says Yes, but it will come down later.
undefined says the section at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#motivation lays out a lot of issues with `sendL2Message` and excess eth at various steps, but fails to mention what _does_ happen to the excess eth if I still just go ahead and do it...
e.g. say I call `sendL2Message` and overpay for gas, where does the excess eth actually go?
undefined says hi, the function you said is called by aggregator.I think you want to ask is depositETH or createRetryableTicket etc, those funcation are payable function, it will need you pay l2 gas, and if you send excess ETH, it will come to your l2 account.
undefined says nvm, got what you meant
undefined says btw, I also saw that the Inbox contract has all its functions protected by a whitelist, does this mean we can't write custom token bridges currently?
undefined says nvm again, I guess the whitelist is set to 0x0 and is basically disabled (correct me if I'm wrong) 🙂
undefined says For Bridge token, you need call GatewayRouter.outBoundTransfer(), this function do not have whitelist.
undefined says yeah, but I'm essentially asking if I can interact with the Inbox contract directly and write my own custom bridge
I'm guessing the answer is yes, coz of ^ this, the whitelist isn't really enforced currently IIUC
undefined says You mean bridge your own new token?
undefined says The answer is yes, and the contract will calculate your l2 token address for you.(standard way)
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#default-standard-bridging
undefined says when a retryable ticket is cancelled on L2, can L1 somehow figure out that the ticket was cancelled?
or is it purely an L2 thing?
undefined says It is an l2 thing.
undefined says even on L2, how do I query if a particular ticket has been cancelled?
undefined says Here may help you: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbretryabletx
undefined says yeah, saw that, but didn't find a function to query if its cancelled...
undefined says Would it be possible for a single dApp to submit only batches of its transactions into a block?
undefined says Hi, there is an event: canceled you can query to see if it has emitted before.
undefined says I assume you mean L2, this was more or less the same area I asked yesterday and I guess is technically possible but practically not. As currently, everything needs to go through the sequencer.
undefined says hey guys! can anyone point me to resources on your IVG protocol?
undefined says tried looking in the docs but I'd like something more detailed if avail
undefined says You can use your contract to create retryable tickets and call inbox.createRetryableTicket().
undefined says Can I actually build my dapp on Arbitrum without deploying the same contract on L1? That means I only deploy my contracts to Arbitrum and I don't care about Ethereum completely. Would this make sense and any issues if I do it this way (other than not being able to bridge into Ethereum)?
Basically using Arbitrum as though it's another blockchain.
undefined says Of course, you can deploy your contract to arbitrum directly
undefined says that is basically the idea about L2 and also why I asked about the sequencer. We don't want to deal with L1 at all given the price but want to make sure if s*** happens, what is the exit strategy(if there is one).
undefined says I’m aware that I can deploy my contracts directly onto Arbitrum. But what I wonder is if I can only deploy my contract on Arbitrum without deploying on L1. That is to say, using Arbitrum as though it’s a stand-alone blockchain without deploying the counterpart contract on L1 at all. Sure, I will lose the ability to bridge my tokens if I don’t deploy my contract on L1. Assuming if I just don’t care about L1 and I just use Arbitrum as a stand-alone blockchain, would this make sense and is this one of the possible usage with Arbitrum? Are people doing this at all? Any issues if we do this?
undefined says Yes, you can deploy to arbitrum without deploying to ethereum.
undefined says my question is more with whether we could use Arbitrum as though it’s a stand-alone blockchain without having to deploy the sane contract on L1. Meaning I only deploy the contract on Arbitrum and have my dapp running on it only.
undefined says I see. Would it make sense if I only deploy to Arbitrum and running my dapps on Arbitrum as though it’s a stand-alone blockchain? Are people doing this? What impact should I consider if I do it this way?
undefined says Many projects have been doing this as you said, you can enjoy arbitrum as a single blockchain network.
undefined says And there is nothing I should be concerned of if I use Arbitrum as a stand-alone blockchain? Security, usage, etc? Do u happen to know some of the projects that are doing it this way? Just wanna get some references from those projects.
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.one you can find some projects from here.
undefined says the concern is what I mentioned, it is currently 'centralized' and if they decide and say 'we don't want to play this anymore', the chain is effectively stalled. arbitrum currently is better in that it can still be 'read'(optimism I have problem doing that, i.e. running my own 'node')
undefined says this is true for all sidechain/l2 currently though.
undefined says Well, almost every projects on the portal deploys their contract on L1 too. I don’t see any projects deploying only to Arbitrum and use it like an standalone chain. What about concerns if I just use Arbitrum as a stand-alone blockchain? Perfectly fine with no concerns?
undefined says contrary to ethereum mainnet, even if no miner function, I can always just start my own and the chain continue and it is always 'readable'(assuming I have a fully sync node)
undefined says Don’t Arbitrum and OE have calldata on L1? Isn’t that meant for this case?
undefined says they usually need to bridge something from L1 to L2(and with the ability to bridge back) and why they usually have them on both side. But a dapp can run 100% on L2 without L1, so long you find a way to fund your L2 ETH, initially
undefined says Strips finance,  they decide to use arbitrum as their first blockchain network to deploy.
undefined says yes and why I said you can 'read'(running arbitrum node locally) but you cannot 'make block' so tx needs someone else. OE is not even at this point
undefined says I can't start my own 'observer node' for OE, well may be it has changed recently
undefined says Thanks! I will check them out!
undefined says If our sequencer node is down, you can still send tx to l1 inbox, it won’t stall.
undefined says yes but I need to replicate the functionality and why I ask how do I do that from a 'node' context and not re-construct everything. i.e. how to turn my node to be able to send to L1 inbox
undefined says OE doesn’t have call data on L1? I think they do store it on their CTC if I’m not wrong.
undefined says The rollups block just used to confirm the state.
undefined says no they have but I don't know how to start a 'observer node'
undefined says Thanks for this! Let’s me feel more confident about doing it only on L2. 🙂
undefined says I am weighting between these two and remotely watching zkSync 2.0(they claim they are EVM compatible but will see)
undefined says umm... when u say nodes, u are referring to running your own sequencer node I suppose?
undefined says yes
undefined says yea their v2 sounds pretty cool.
undefined says oh yea sadly the sequencer node is permissioned on both Arbitrum or OE yet. Even though we can’t participate as sequencers, I wonder if could at least sync our own full node from the sequencer for our own dapps to query against?
undefined says arbitrum yes. optimism last I check problematic. I haven't revisited it yet
undefined says we don't want to rely on a third party rpc endpoint, for various reasons
undefined says Infura has support for both Aribitrum and OE. So I’m guessing syncing up a full node might be possible because otherwise Infura wouldnt be able to do so?
undefined says you are probably right.
undefined says but the doc was lacking on how to do that a few months back for optimism, would check it out soon
undefined says Yea finding dev info and resources about both Arbitrum and OE can sometimes be difficult.😅
undefined says any way to query it on-chain from other contracts?
undefined says Perhaps there is no such function to call, but you can call cancel to see if it reverts.
undefined says However, this is not a good way.
undefined says Do not recommend, I will ask the team to see if they have any other methods to do this.
undefined says I am sorry we do not have such function to do so, may I ask why you want to query on chain?
undefined says I was thinking if I could send the cancellation back to L1 and reverse tickets (in case they get stuck)
undefined says Perhaps not, It is irreversible.
undefined says I re-read the doc again and this paragraph caught my eye
undefined says Additionally, users always have the option of avoiding reliance on the sequencer altogether by posting transactions directly on-chain themselves (i.e., skipping steps A and B above). In this scenario, their transaction will be queued up for validators to include in an assertion once the sequencer posts its next batch or a protocol enforced time-period elapses (set to 24 hours for mainnet beta), whichever comes first. Users should rarely, if ever, need to go this route to include their transaction, but the recourse to do so ensures that Arbitrum’s censorship resistance properties are ensured even if the sequencer goes offline.
undefined says so on top of me re-construct the messageData(which is basically the L2 tx info, no doc about how), I still need to wait for 'validators' to attest it. Then that comes back to my original question, without sequencer/validator, the chain is still stalled which is what I expect, I can submit but no one to create the 'assertion' ? Then my next question would be, how can I run a validator ? need some form of staking ?
undefined says This docs just means need validator to confirm your state, however, your state is decided once you send tx to the inbox. For example, when you send a tx to inbox, after that, there are 2 nodes compute your state but get a different results(which means there must be a wrong state), so you need to trust a validator stake a state to get(usually validator will stake on the right state, because they will get slashed if they do not be honest),but if you run your own node honest, then you don’t need to rely on a validator to get state.
undefined says but let's say there are no validator, I submit a tx(with the revised state?), some other nodes run it(which results in different state), now what ? this is effectively the same as a 'split' in the ethereum sense ? so we have S1 -> tx1 -> S2/S3/S4, now when a next tx runs, what state it refers ?
undefined says where S2/S3/S4 are the result of node2/3/4
undefined says This is depends on which tx included in inbox first.
undefined says but I am the only one who submit it to the inbox, no ?
undefined says the tx in inbox have sequence also, and the state is decided by that sequence.
undefined says let's say in S1 I have 2 ETH, I submit a tx which said after this I have 1 ETH but I send 2 ETH to someone else. and assume I am the one put that in first, all the math is then wrong ?
undefined says as I create one more ETH out of nothing
undefined says there is no attestation so it is only decided by who goes it first ?
undefined says This tx will be reverted, just as l1.
undefined says reverted by whom ?
undefined says But the tx will be included.
undefined says Reverted by anyone who will compute the state.
undefined says Because they will follow the evm.
undefined says if that is the case, what is the point of validators ?
undefined says Validator just used to confirm the state, because if there is no validator, when state is different, you need choose a node to trust, for normal user, the best choice is trust the state confirmed by validator.
undefined says so you mean if I run my own node, I don't need to care about validator ?
undefined says If you can make sure you are honest.
undefined says of course, I am not cheating myself
undefined says It does, and you can even challenge validator if you think they are wrong.
undefined says Hello, big thanks for the Arbitrum team for a great work they do. Does anyone have any instructions on how to run full blockchain locally? I've read the FAQ and there's seem to only be information regarding node setup. There's a page on the docs section which I monitor for quite some time now, but it does not seem to be updated yet https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain
undefined says You mean run what blockchain? Arbitrum is a rollups network, we are not blockchain because we rely on ethereum blockchain.
undefined says If you want to test, you can use our testnet run on rinkeby.
undefined says I think meaning we can run the rollup on our own private chain.
undefined says We have not write that docs for now, but we will write in the future.
undefined says Once again, comparing with optimism, I can deploy their L1 contracts on our own private chain and then make them the L2 on our own chain. This is essential for development
undefined says There are many things that is very difficult to do using rinkeby
undefined says oh and also the sequencer
undefined says yeah sure, it's clear, just was wondering how to run it fully locally including sequencer and evetything else
undefined says same question here 🙂
undefined says We have that code on GitHub, but we have not written docs yet, in the future we will do.
undefined says Got it, maybe I can figure it out from code itself, some docker is there or?... Can you please give me a link to where on gh I should look?
undefined says A community just use our code to run an arbitrum network on Xdai haha.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs
undefined says so the node can indeed be an aggregator(which I assume send messageData to inbox) or sequencer
undefined says fmt.Printf("\n")
    fmt.Printf("Sample usage:                  arb-node --conf=<filename> \n")
    fmt.Printf("          or:  forwarder node: arb-node --l1.url=<L1 RPC> [optional arguments]\n\n")
    fmt.Printf("          or: aggregator node: arb-node --l1.url=<L1 RPC> --node.type=aggregator [optional arguments] %s\n", cmdhelp.WalletArgsString)
    fmt.Printf("          or:       sequencer: arb-node --l1.url=<L1 RPC> --node.type=sequencer [optional arguments] %s\n", cmdhelp.WalletArgsString)
undefined says are there any hardware recommendations for running my own node?
undefined says anyone knows how to interact with a L1 RPC that requires authentication?
undefined says I sync a full node and based on what I see, it needs quite some memory as it is caching a lot of thing, took 26GB for the fully sync rinkeby, it also needs fast CPU to replay the txs(on a  R5 xlarge it took me a week yet on another bare metal only 3-4 days). also need storage of about 20GB for the DB and bang pretty hard on L1, use up my free tier alchemy for one of the sync node)
undefined says if it is like alchemy/infura, just use the full url which contains the projectid. if it needs header, would need some form of relay/proxy by apache2/nginx
undefined says thanks alot this helps
undefined says Hi 👋
undefined says How can I use Arbitrum to send cryptos with lower gas fees ?
undefined says Are there any examples/templates for bridging a mintable/dynamic supply token on L2 to L1? Docs only describe this for it:
```
If your custom token has the ability to increase its supply (i.e, mint) directly on the L2, and you want the L2-minted tokens be withdrawable back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract, it will probably require its own special gateway. Otherwise, the Generic-Custom Gateway is likely the right solution for you!
```
undefined says if Optimism and Boba have fraud proofs disabled, does that mean that unlike Arbitrum they can submit an invalid state root and there's no way to challenge it currently?
undefined says Hi! I am trying to understand the situations in which transactions are created on ETH L1. I'm struggling to understand this having read "Inside Arbitrum" doc and poking around on Arbiscan/Etherscan. Can anyone point me to useful docs on this? Maybe a "life of a transaction"? I want to see when there are transactions created on L1 (L1=>L2 bridging, or vice-versa), what they contain, and how that is derived from L2 activity. Thanks
undefined says all L2 use L1 as a form of 'storage'. In the case of arbitrum, they are stored in the inbox L1 contract. it is no different than say in RDBMS, log shipping. L1 in this case is only function as data store. Though I think there are also L1 contract that can function as 'on chain prover' (to validatate the stored tx info and state) but that is going to be expensive and only used when being challenged. At least that is how optimism does it, not sure how arbitrum do that yet.
undefined says What is the token for this project?
undefined says Thanks. I am confused because the arb batches are written to L1 via the Sequencer Inbox contract. I was expecting it to happen under the Bridge or Rollup contracts, and the Inbox contracts within Ethereum to handle L1=>L2 calls such as for bridging assets into L2. See https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf07f3499128d7a24642df653deb7faebb70e397fd1cd27e6c68ee241ae538b5c
undefined says Did you try reading the #🧠︱faq that the Arbitrum team put together to answer questions like this?
undefined says what kind of iops for the HDD does it require ?  you running ssd or spinning ?  i build by own stack so i can check what an r5 xl is equiv to also.  thx man
undefined says Hi, does your smart comtract conform IArbToken?
undefined says Hi, you can just bridge your funds to arbitrum, and the gas will be lower than ethereum mainnet. The bridge: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says I will let the team know and update the hardware requirements on the docs.
undefined says Right, arbitrum is the same, this is how optimistic rollup works.
undefined says based on what I see, CPU is more important that storage speed, my bare matal was using a HDD and AWS is gp2 but the bare matal sync faster. Though once sync, it doesn't really matters, this is true for all blockchain, the actual resource requirement is not that high to keep it going. the init sync is what too most time as it needs to replay from genesis. So probably very fast CPU/storage to sync then tarball it and move to any other setup
undefined says for arbitrum, memory is an issue, it is the highest for the blockchain I have tested. even more so than cardano which is known to be memory hog(probably because it is using haskell)
undefined says ok.. cool .  is the validator node setup ready for public testing ?  do i test with testnet or how do most people start ?  I have a ton of hardware and experience maintaining datacenter stacks..  i have a full cab at a local NOC as well with about 20U free and several dell r730 boxes with 256GB RAM and like 40 ish cpu cores.. lol.. so let's spin up some nodes right !!
undefined says is each node going to have a full copy of the chain or does it prune like geth and rely on archival nodes ?  i will read the docs more thoroughly tomorrow but I don't recall seeing this.  you said above 20 gigs - is that all for now ? what kind of specs to future proof it ?  I'll probably just slap a couple of 2tb ssd's in it regardless but if it's 1/100th i maybe can run a few.  thx !
undefined says I meant rinkeby but mainnet shouldn't be too different. hard to say how fast it grows though.
undefined says Hi, is the source code of the NodeInterface contract (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/rpc-utils/nodeinterface) available  on Github?

I'm unable to find it in the repo https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/tree/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin
undefined says Hoping to talk to a team member about choosing Arbitrum for our dApp... I have one technical questions that I have no been able to find an answer to
undefined says Hi, this is just help you to get information about outbox proof, this not an on chain contract.
undefined says Hi, what questions do you have?
undefined says Thinking of how building an off chain CLOB (like dydx) where the users are abstracted away from the blockchain... gasless, and the exchange pays settlement costs... How does that work with an optimistic rollup like Arbitrum?
undefined says Hmm, you mean you don’t want user to interact with the blockchain? But dydx still need user to interact.Sorry I don’t get what your detail meaning.
undefined says users of dYdX, deposit funds to the L2 contract and can trade on dYdX with them in a gasless manner, like a CEX.... 
The CLOB and matching engine are off chain. 

dYdX periodically settles transactions on L1 via starkware starkex.... 

They pay the cost to settle and make money from exchange fees (like a CEX)

The users can issue, modify, cancel limit orders without an on chain transaction, like a CEX
undefined says Got that, currently the arbitrum network is a universal network that everyone can deploy their smart contract on it, you can also write your code and deploy on it. But as for DYDX, they use a single like rollups which just DYDX live on that network, if you also want to use arbitrum like this, you can also build your own arbitrum which our code is open source on github(someone use this and build an arbitrum solution network on Xdai).
undefined says Is there any way to return data from an L2 contract instantly from L1? My understanding is that it requires the ticketing system and separate transactions, but seems surprising if there are no transactions being executed, just pulling data.
undefined says Sorry, we don’t have an official way to get that from l2 instantly.
undefined says Is there an unofficial way? I guess I could create an Infura endpoint to grab L2 data and then set up a Chainlink API to ping that?
undefined says In theory, of course you can do this, but it is not instant.
undefined says I haven't deployed one yet - I'm just interested in what the standard should be for having a mintable token on L2 that can bridge to L1. The docs just say "you might need something other than the generic token gateway if you have a dynamic supply token on L2" but provides no further details.
undefined says You may see from this topic, here will show you the way to deploy a l2 based token and how can you bridge it to l1. https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway
undefined says That doc doesn't describe a recommended way for mintable L2 tokens:
```
If your custom token has the ability to increase its supply (i.e, mint) directly on the L2, and you want the L2-minted tokens be withdrawable back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract, it will probably require its own special gateway. Otherwise, the Generic-Custom Gateway is likely the right solution for you!
```
undefined says It just says you will probably need your own special gateway
undefined says You mean those steps? https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway
undefined says Yes, it says in all *other* cases the generic-custom gateway should work, but not with tokens where the supply increases on L2 instead of L1
undefined says Your token should conform to the minimum IArbToken interface; i.e., it should have bridgeMint and bridgeBurn methods only callable by the L2CustomGateway contract, and the address of its corresponding Ethereum token accessible via l1Address. For an example implementation, see TestArbCustomToken.
undefined says I think that's the wrong way around. You'd need to have bridgeMint/bridgeBurn on the L1 side if the L2 token is the one with the increasing supply (e.g. by LP rewards)
undefined says If you confirm that interface, you can write other code you want and just deploy it.
undefined says In my scenario the L2 token should not be mintable/burnable by the L1 token. Basically the bridge would be inverted (so bridgeMint goes on the L1 token and not L2).
undefined says It would be good to have something like that described in the docs so people can conform to a provided standard instead of write custom solutions for each token where L2 has token emission and L1 is sort of the "wrapped" version
undefined says Oh, I got what your mean, sorry for misunderstanding, I will take a look of this and send the update back to you.
undefined says hi all, quick question for you!  does arbitrum always post call data to the L1? I've been looking at the contracts and it seems like call data is not always posted to the L1 - from what i can see, it only posts tx data to the outbox inside of rollupcore or for challenges inside challenge.sol
undefined says Are there any examples  / reference contracts or architectures for how to programmatically transfer tokens from mainnet to Arbitrum and then execute arbitrary function call(s) on Arbitrum (e..g, swap on Uniswap) all as a single transaction?  Basically, seamless interoperability from mainnet to Arbitrum?  Would it require use of a 3rd-party bridge (e.g., Hop, Connect), and if so, which bridges are top of mind?
undefined says Hi, you can find call data at inbox(0x4Dbd4fc535Ac27206064B68FfCf827b0A60BAB3f) and sequencer inbox(0x4c6f947Ae67F572afa4ae0730947DE7C874F95Ef)
undefined says Hi, you can send your funds from l1 to l2 as a single tx, but this single tx can not include others steps to call other contracts like uniswap, so you need 2 steps to make those tx.And if you bridge your token from l1 to l2, you can use https://bridge.arbitrum.io/.
undefined says How would I do this programmatically (i.e., through a Solidity contract)?  Interested in creating cross-layer composable protocol.  Are there patterns / protocols that are doing this either through the Arbitrum Bridge or through 3rd party bridges that you'd recommend taking a look at?
undefined says You can create a retryable ticket to to this.This is inbox’s function, https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#ethereum-to-arbitrum-retryable-tickets
undefined says How many block confirmations do we need in order t consider that the transaction is final  and cannot be removed because of block reorganization

e.g. in ethereum this number is around 12 block confirmations
undefined says It depends on your definition of finality, lets say for example that 2 parties want to agree that their tx will be correctly completed/executed. 

As soon as the sequencer (or any aggregator, or yourself) posts your tx on chain (and you wait for L1 finality) then everyone knows that it's part of the canonical transaction chain. The data is ordered and available in the L1. Anyone running a node knows that is the correct order of executing the tx in their node.

Then there is the question if this correct order and execution will be enforced by the rollup / dispute resolution protocol.

If the 2 parties trust at least 1 of the validators taking part in the protocol (that they will enforce the correct outcome), then it's safe to assume that the finality takes the time for your batch being posted in the L1 and the time to finality they usually expect in the L1.

We've also got 2 links in our docs that prob articulate these ideas better than I can haha
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/tx_lifecycle
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says Thanks I will check it
undefined says So if I understand correctly - once the transaction is send to the sequencer - we can consider it finalized. 

What happens if Sequencer broadcast a transaction on L1, but blockchain is reorganized on L1 (Ethereum) 

Is the sequencer sending another transaction to L1
undefined says Yes, it will do. Finalize have many degrees on arbitrum, it depends on how you think what stage can be recoginze as finalize.
undefined says more questions from me! what is your average tx size in bytes? any rough estimates?
undefined says Hi, how long does it take to sync the node? My node made some progress but crashed half way with this:
```
{"level":"warn","component":"core","elapsed":30044.722128,"time":"2021-11-30T14:55:11-06:00","caller":"/home/ubuntu/arbitrum/packages/arb-util/core/lookup.go:149","message":"Message delivery taking too long"}   
./arb-node(_Z14sigUsr2Handleri+0x25)[0xeb6515] 
```
undefined says And when I tried to restart it, it got stuck here
```
Seeding cache
Last L2 block saved to database: 1689424
```
undefined says Hi @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs can I bridge ERC20 tokens to Arbitrum from a smart contract? (for example bridging over USDC)
The goal is to transfer tokens to Arbitrum in a decentralized manner (exact rules such as recipient immutable and set in the smart contract).
I don't see any contract calling outboundTransfer, so not sure if this has ever been done
undefined says It’s hard to say average because different tx are huge various, you can estimate your tx on arbiscan by calculating the gas spent on l1 calldata.
undefined says You can call GatewayRouter.outBoundTransfer(),GatewayRouter(0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef)
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs any thoughts on my syncing issue?
undefined says Sorry, I don’t know about this issue, but I will update to you when I get answers from the team.
undefined says Thanks! Do you know roughly how long it takes to fully sync the node?
undefined says It depends on your network, but it won’t take too long since the arbitrum just went live for couple months.
undefined says It took me a week to sync the rinkeby chain on R5 xlarge. Based on my observation, CPU is more important that storage speed and the most important is lots of memory as it keeps a lot in memory. That is also why when you restart it, it is as if it is stalled in that 'Last L2 block saved ...', it is actually 'preparing' for sync.
undefined says I think there needs to be some 'tarballed' db, especially for development say rinkeby to speed up this process
undefined says That's really good to know, thank you.
I started syncing yesterday on mainnet, and I think I'm sync'ed to October transactions now. Still a way to go 😄
undefined says Hi, did you solve this problems? it might have been an issue with your# L1 node connecting to the L2 node?
if your reboot does the sync continue as normal?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs where can I take a look at docs for running a node?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says The sync continued, yes. But I still don't know why it crashed in the first place. So far the syncing has been going fine.
undefined says It may be wrong with your l1 node connection, But it’s fine now that it can run normally
undefined says guys are there any opportunities to stake and generate income standing up a full node ? I have found articles that reference staking but no amounts or details.. thx for info.
undefined says Hey! I am thinking of adding Arbitrum to TxStreet (tx visualizer). What kind of node do I need to run to subscribe to network events, similar to mainnet? Such as...
```
web3.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions' ...
web3.eth.subscribe('newBlockHeaders', ...
```

Is this possible right now?
undefined says have you attempted to use Alchemy or Infura?
undefined says I haven't yet. For mainnet, it was much cheaper to run our own nodes with the amount of rpc calls we do. Maybe it makes more sense to use one of those services for Arbitrum though.
undefined says if you'd like can you DM me? maybe we can get some convo going with our teams 🙂
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs does Alchemy or Infura provide pending transactions? I don't see it in their docs
undefined says not too sure tbh, but im sure if u ask em directly they can you give an answer
undefined says will transaction fees get cheapers when theres more users on Arbitrum?
undefined says I thought the more user the more expensive it should be ? unless you mean less tx on L1 that drag down L1 gas price
undefined says There is a value. When the value is lower than this value, the higher the transaction volume, the cheaper it is. If it is higher than this value, the network will start to be congested and it will become more and more expensive.
undefined says You mean those steps? https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway
undefined says Hmm, sorry I don’t get what your mean.
undefined says I thought the more user the more expensive it should be ? unless you mean less tx on L1 that drag down L1 gas price
undefined says There is a l1 fixed fee, which is a fee used for l1 tx cost(Split equally by all users) except l1 calldata fee(l1 calldata fee + l1 fixed fee = fee pays on l1), what he said is more user can lower down the l1 fixed fee.
undefined says ah the fix cost overhead, in conventional world 🙂
undefined says hello
undefined says Do you know how to get a whitelist
undefined says what？
undefined says Is the caretaker there?
undefined says are we able to move to arbitrum only the tokens listed at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ or there are more ways (more tokens) to it?
undefined says Is there any new development recently
undefined says admin
undefined says 8 dayssss....? what in the world
undefined says oky
undefined says Hi, you can use this script: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts#bridge-a-standard-token
undefined says We will update our network to arbitrum nitro soon it will let the network support wasm and lower the gas fee.
undefined says quick question:

1) where is the sequencer feed documentation?
2) what are the req. to run a node, esp space?
undefined says gm
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#staking

"A block is also implicitly claiming that its older siblings (older blocks with the same predecessor), if there are any, are incorrect. If two blocks are siblings, and the older sibling is correct, then the younger sibling is considered incorrect, even if everything else in the younger sibling is true."
undefined says Does this merely mean that the block is not part of the tree, or can the invalid block be slashed?
undefined says I'm pretty sure they are not, but just want to be more than pretty sure
undefined says Not, also the invalid will be slashed.
undefined says That means you can be slashed due to a race condition? Two honest proposers posting their commitment in earnest
undefined says 1) https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#sequencer-mode 
2) r5d.2xlarge with more than 120 g storage.
undefined says And bahm, one of them gets slashed??
undefined says Anyone who lose the challenge.
undefined says seq. has a port, so ig i can talk to it, what kind of methods does it have? i wanna docs for that
undefined says Same as ethereum: https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API
undefined says whats the diff between rpc/ws vs the sequencer ?
undefined says But there's nothing to challenge
undefined says I'm talking about two completely valid commitments
undefined says That happen to share a parent but commit to a different height
undefined says Sibling, honest, commitments
undefined says How much does a commitment cost right now and how many tx's can it handle? What is the mainnet contract address?
undefined says I will check this with the team.
undefined says It is flexible, here is sequencer inbox address: 0x4c6f947Ae67F572afa4ae0730947DE7C874F95Ef
undefined says Yes I will next week thanks 🙂 Just need to sort some stuff out first
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 
1) can i bind ws and rpc port to 127.0.0.1 instead?
2) dont see the seq. port here, can i add that too (e.g. -p 127.0.0.1:9642:9642)?
undefined says you can learn more about how to use `-p` by looking at general Docker documentation
undefined says i tried using -p localhost:8547:8547 but when i check my ports its exposed to everyone
undefined says man i do not like using docker haha
undefined says use `127.0.0.1`
undefined says i do use 127.0.0.1, doesnt make a diff
undefined says ` docker run --network "host" --rm -d -it -v /arbitrum/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 127.0.0.1:8547:8547 -p 127.0.0.1:8548:8548 -p 127.0.0.1:9642:9642 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.0.0-2b628f8 --l1.url http://127.0.0.1:8545 `
undefined says ^is my starting cmd
undefined says i mean, my firewall prevents access to it, but why isnt it binding to localhost :pepekek:
undefined says https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/2174
undefined says oh lol
undefined says dont wanna change sysctl.conf tbh, firewall blocks it so ig ill just run with it, thanks for the help
undefined says ok last question, how long does syncing usually take?
undefined says depends on the speed of your CPU and storage volume, usually a few days
undefined says Maybe we should promote ecological construction and invest a lot of money
undefined says This is how bsc and plo developed
undefined says on average, how much does it cost to add a new token to the bridge and deploy the token on L2?
undefined says standard 18 decimal erc20, no special behaviors
undefined says ggggg
undefined says hello
undefined says hi
undefined says hello
undefined says Hi @calax , did you solve this? I'm having a similar issue with a MasterChef contract
undefined says hi bro
undefined says Hey guys, what is the best way to estimate how much ETH a user will be paying for a transaction?
On L1 there is just intrinsic + computation cost it can be done by using the `gas` and `gasPrice` in globals
But on Arbitrum, what is best way to estimate?
undefined says You should use eth_estimateGas and getGasPrice and multiple them.
undefined says Just like ethereum mainnet
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hi, is there any documentation for the `sendContractTransaction` when using the eth to arbitrum bridge?
undefined says From what I see in the Inbox contract it's only for L2 to L1 message passing right?
undefined says It's a bit confusing since its an "Inbox" contract but has a few sendL2Message functions
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-eth/bridge/inbox
undefined says It’s from l1 to l2.
undefined says That's not really documentation, just a function signature.
undefined says Not going to deep into the source, the difference I see from the createRetryableTicket is that it automatically gets the maxSubmissionCost via `ArbRetryableTx.getSubmissionPrice`  and reverts if not enough eth is payed, however I don't see it is a payable function.
undefined says and what is the amount param suppose to represent?
undefined says After call `ArbRetryableTx.getSubmissionPrice`  , you need to call `inbox.createRetryableTicket`, this function is payable
undefined says What's the use of `sendContractTransaction` ?
undefined says Here：https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#bridging , we recommend use retryable ticket to send tx because it is more safe if the l2 tx is reverted due to gas lack.
undefined says Okay so only `createRetryableTicket` is recommended for any L1-to-L2 communication included transferring tokens/eth
undefined says I mean in the smart contract. we want to rebate the keeper appropriately.
what we are finding particularly challenging is to estimate the L2 storage expansion cost
undefined says If you want to transfer token, you can read https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/71320feebdbbb77e3cf09bba05995361982ba2b3/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbSys.sol#L79-L83
undefined says You can use this function as a helper to get l2 storage cost.
undefined says Here is the address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses#arbitrum-precompiles-l2-same-on-all-arb-chains
undefined says Oh thanks very much, i think this is what I was looking for
undefined says Can i please get some help with a problem im having im willing to pay 100 usdt 
I am attempting to chang the multi-call on pancake SDK to my new router

The swapExactEthForTokens has 3 new parameters, those being: _factory, initicodehash, lastVal, thousands. The swapExactTokensForEth also adds 3 new parameters, however it gets rid of the “to” parameter.

Im trying to change pancake SDK to do the following Call the functions of the router “getAmountsOut”, “getAmountsOutPancakeV1” and “getAmountsOutWaultswap” via a multicall. The lastVal and thousands should be 9975 and 10000 Once the multicall is done, select the best price and call the “swapExactEthForTokens” or “swapExactTokensForEth”

I cant get it to call properly - what exactly do i change within the SDK - the old pancakeswap router is this: 0x10ED43C718714eb63d5aA57B78B54704E256024E the new router to use is this: 0x45a0DCA705EDeDffd6cE60feB1C8007Ca280a410
undefined says Hello, pancake swap does not live on arbitrum.
undefined says i know i just need help in over all
undefined says can you help ❤️ ?
undefined says I don’t know how pancake work, sorry for that.
undefined says question: the transactions im getting from the code snipped below are all confirmed, how do i get them before they are mined? 
```
const arbitrumProvider = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider("ws://127.0.0.1:8548");
arbitrumProvider.on("pending", async function(_pending) {
  //_pending already confirmed
});
```
undefined says 2nd question: are transactions ordered by gasPrice?
undefined says also, calling `getTransaction(_pending)` results into `null` most of the time
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs tagging u lee since u work on the nodes, tried to dm you but we arent friends :2798_tobeysad:
undefined says There's no mempool, and intentionally no visibility into transactions that haven't been sequenced yet, to prevent frontrunning.
undefined says so ig only sequencers are gonna be able to frontrun? so a bit like avax with the staking thing
undefined says thx
undefined says Now more and more defi projects prefer arb. If ecological construction can be further invested, there are some original ecological star projects, I believe arb will far surpass bsc
undefined says If one was to run a chainlink node on Arbitrum, they would need to run a full validator node?
undefined says hey folks, i'm attempting to write a pseudorandomness generator on arbitrum. existing implementations that work well enough on L1 use block.timestamp and block.blockhash and block.coinbase as inputs to a hashing method. are these block params 1) available on all arbitrum blocks, 2) more exploitable by Arbi's sequencers?
undefined says block.timestamp, block.blockhash, and block.coinbase are all exposed.  Building an RNG based on them isn't totally awful.  The sequencer can influence the result, but if the sequencer is honest, then the result is as useful as the same algorithm would be on L1
undefined says cheers, thanks - if the result is similar to L1 then we should be in good shape
undefined says Is there a way to confirm no visibility into Txs?
undefined says when will the committee based sequencing timing scheduled be released to the community in terms of how arbitrum is thinking about it
undefined says including who can join the committe
undefined says Hi, is there a way to map L1 block numbers to L2 block numbers? I have a contract that shows the L1 block number at which an event was emitted. I need to go and grab that event but I only know the L1 block number and I need the L2 one in order to find the event. I also can't modify the contracts code..
undefined says We currentl have no timeline to open sequencer.
undefined says you can use block.number to get a value close to (but not necessarily exactly) the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction.
undefined says How can I then get the event on L1 using web3js? A Web3 connection requires that I provide a contract address. Is a contract I deploy on Arbitrum available on L1 too? So that I can read events from it.
undefined says 1. https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/web3-eth-contract.html#getpastevents
2. Nope, you need re-deploy a contract to l1, and they don’t share state.
undefined says Is there a timeline to announce the timeline 🙂 not even trying to be cheeky just genuinely interested
undefined says Sorry, we don’t have so, we alaways make a timeline when we are very sure about it, because we don’t like deny.
undefined says But you can run a full node
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says Ah ok thanks. Yes getPastEvents is what I'm using. It works well on L1. But I want to move over to Arbitrum.

The only problem is my contract gives me block.number which is L1 block number. But I need the L2 block number to find the events in front end js code. And I can't modify the contract code because it is audited and don't want to make changes.
undefined says It’s true you guys are great at hitting deadlines so makes sense thank you for responding
undefined says if I may ask a somewhat controversial question: based on the amount of off chain logic for certain zk proof based scaling solutions require as well as the centralized provide role why do you even need a blockchain for those use cases
undefined says Also am I wrong in thinking that the zkproof cryptographic voodoo has more flaws than is marketed (which is this magic thing that just makes sure everything is always secure)
undefined says It would be interesting for you to write down:

1. What off-chain logic is used
2. What flaws you think ZK proof rollups have

Then ask whether those are an issue given the fact that Ethereum provides a mechanism to avoid censorship and deal with liveness failures. Does a ZK solution provide a good user experience with enough security given the inherited security it gains from being an L2?
undefined says You can use ArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber(), here is the interface: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/71320feebdbbb77e3cf09bba05995361982ba2b3/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbSys.sol#L79-L83
undefined says Have you performed this exercise previously 😂
undefined says Yes and I’ve come to the conclusion that, as long as the L1 contract isn’t controlled by anyone (which they currently are for most L2s), the trade offs taken by ZK rollups is a great solution where I get cheap, fast transactions without sacrificing my security. 

You should do the same analysis as part of your question so people know what risks/concerns you see so they can respond to your concerns.
undefined says thanks for this and I will
undefined says Hi,

How can I list transactions that have been confirmed by the sequencer? And what are the chances that some of those transactions are not included in the rollup in L1? I am working on a real-time price chart product and currently, it only shows the price update after the block number is stamped (which is after the L1 rollup has been done). I am wondering that since the tx confirmation in Arbitrum is so fast, so the chart should be as fast as the tx confirmation time.

Getting the txs in the sequencer can also help DEXes to be more precise in token amount calculation. I am not sure what is the current approach that DEXes are using. What would happen if there is a large amount of swap tx in the sequencer that highly impacts token balance in LP? Will other users see this and re-calculate the token amount accordingly?
undefined says Does arbitrum have the same 24.x Kb limit to contract size as mainnet?
undefined says infura down for anyone else?
undefined says hi, does anyone know what maxSubmissionCost refers to? In particular, the parameter in depositEth transactions sent to the Arbitrum: Inbox?
undefined says 
undefined says ty!
undefined says also what is the gas limit for a single tx on arbi?
undefined says Hi, you can get tx from sequencer by directly call our officially rpc, it will return the latest state run by the sequencer, I thought they can not get the latest state by sequencer is because they use other way they think more safety.
undefined says Arbitrum does not have a hard ArbGas limit, and in general an Arbitrum chain can consume many more ArbGas units per second of computation, but we do not recommend you deploy a huge contract.
undefined says SubmissionCost is used to pay l2 for the retryable ticket storage, https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbretryabletx from this docs you can see `getSubmissionPrice` to get it.
undefined says ty
undefined says I'm not sure which channel is appropriate to post this in. https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/918162491429765232
undefined says My question in support channel regarding calldata and AddressTable
undefined says Hello, when you assume this, you have already assumed that the index we use is 160bits (the length of the address is also 160bits), but in fact, the size of the index will be much smaller than this value
undefined says You mean the index of the calldata or the mapping of addresses?  If calldata, is this a more efficient pattern to use, like the ArbiSwap args byte array param? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/Arbiswap_V2_mono/blob/5b7c38ebbc97bf1784c23526b9b75879cd053cdf/packages/other_contracts/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L613
undefined says Hey all, sanity check Q here, I want to build a contract on arbi that given a passed in tokenID, resolves the address of the owner of that tokenID on a specified NFT contract on L1 (for payment splitting purposes), is it possible / is there a convenient way to do this today on-chain?
undefined says The index of address, also the index of address will combine other parameters and then become the calldata on l1.
undefined says Maybe you should use bridge or oracle to achieve this.
undefined says "Gas Used by Transaction" on arbiscan includes the L1 gas, correct?
undefined says In tx page, it does.But in block information page, it doesn’t.
undefined says makes sense, thanks 👍
undefined says Good day. Is there a way to scan an Arbitrum node for L1 blocks? (To see which L1 block corresponds to which L2 block)
undefined says Hi, you mean from l1 to know the current block number of l2?Maybe it hard to do so, may I ask why you want to do this?Maybe we can solve this by another way.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Sort of yes. I have a historical L1 block number and I need to know what the L2 block number was at that time.

I have smart contract code that I can not change because I don't want to send it in for auditing again. That smart contract has a list of proposals that were made (objects with a few variables) that also contains the block number (block.number) at which they were created. Each proposal has additional data stored about it in events that were emitted when they were created. I need to go find those events. But the block number (stored in the proposal object) is the L1 block number and not L2. So I need to know L2 block number in order to get the events on that block. 

I can't modify the solidity code. So I need a way to go from L1 block number to L2 block number.
undefined says Can you use timestamp to estimate that？
undefined says @Laderlappen Do you mean I get the timestamp for the L1 block and then check which block is closest to that timestamp on L2?
undefined says Yes
undefined says And you can alse use l2block number to get l1 number by this（may help you）：when you ask for a tx receipt it always returns you the estimate of the l1BlockNumber
curl -s https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getTransactionReceipt","params": ["0xe1ebb59a858e98b4952ba13d1d6e84b30bbbe79c4dd5ef3c740ad826ce633831"],"id":1}' | grep l1BlockNumber
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Ah alright, thank you for the help!
undefined says Hi, I'm curious about the way Arbitrum works from inside. I've tried to follow up this old guide (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/ape-patch/docs/Local_Blockchain.md) to build up a local chain and got stuck at demo:deploy. Is there a way to build a localchain from scratch or from the forked mainnet currently?
undefined says No, we do not support this now.
undefined says I plan on running my own Arb node so I can send transactions to it. Then execute fast withdraws to L1 for my users. Is this the appropriate plan for a private company with a captured audience on Arbitrum? Do I need to stake my validator to do this?
undefined says Based off of this from the docs >To carry out a tradable exit, a user first initializes a withdrawal; a third party — the liquidity provider — can immediately verify that the withdrawal is valid (i.e., that it will finalize eventually) by validating the Arbitrum chain. The liquidity provider then offers to buy the exit by paying the user on L1.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/withdrawals#tradeable-bridge-exits
undefined says Hi Admin, Need help with bridging an ERC20 from rinkeby to testnet arbitrum.  Thank you.
undefined says There are already many liquidity solutions, and exchanges will join in, maybe you have to consider carefully
undefined says Hi, you mean liquidity withdraw? If so, your bridge need have enough token to liquid, but you can also use 3rd party bridge, which is also fast enough: cbridge, hop and access.
undefined says Bridge a new token? Maybe this can help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts#bridge-a-standard-token
undefined says hi there - i have been trying to educate myself on this topic more so so i can ask more intelligent questions - have you come across any resources that helped inform your view?
undefined says specifically i was trying to investigate your comment that most L2s control the smart contract -> i understand that the ordering service (sequencer) is currently quite centralized across most L2s
undefined says I am having issue with the arb-ts Bridge package. I guess i will try this again. Thanks for the repo link. 👍🏼
undefined says all - i want to run a full node but im not a dev and the current instructions are honestly not in my current skill set.  i run an eth full validator now - no problems - is there anything comparable to that / will there be / that I can spin up and help out the network ?  thx for the help.
undefined says Hi, thanks for that, if you want to run a node for api, you can get an alchemy to run a node, but if you want to take part in the arbitrum network, we currently do not open the validator registration for some reasons.
undefined says There isn’t a single resource, you just have to go read code, look at contracts, and read anything others publish and try to understand the whole. 

The comment on “control the L2” isn’t around who owns the sequencer, but whether or not there is a group that can upgrade the L1 contract that controls the funds. That is the biggest risk for using any L1 contract, including the one that bridges assets to L2s.
undefined says yeah that's what i want to do !!!  i've done all i can do so far in my world ..  bridged $ over.. bought and minted NFT's ..  used sushi swap ..  good stuff.  i am ready to dive into the infrastructure though..
undefined says are the validators all run on chainlink nodes rn ?
undefined says Haha, enjoy it.
undefined says We run validator by ourselves.
undefined says they looking for 3rd parties maybe ?  job opening ?  i have a nice stack at a tier1 data facility.. would be happy to spin up some nodes when the network is ready to start decentrallization efforts..
undefined says i keep reading that full decentralization is the ultimate goal so i would assume at *some* point we should start to beta test actually running the code on outside stacks..  🙂   so here i am !! lol
undefined says Haha, you mean chainlink? I don’t know if they have done so, lol.
undefined says Glad to have you on arbitrum.
undefined says Also, you have a wonderful avatar hahah.
undefined says ya chainlink.  i was looking at maybe spinning up a chainlink node actually.. just kind of expensive and i was doing rocketpool first..  that's my avatar as well - it's a 'rocketeer' - what a great group these guys are.. ive learned an incredible amount since doing this..
undefined says you know rocketpool  /  heard of the system ?  i think its genius.. i am pretty dang fortunate imo to be one of the OG's there.. i think i attached to a really promising protocol.  these guys are bright.. the members are bright..  just a very well thought out and rewarding system they have created ..  and it's brilliantly successful so far in it's first live month .. it's insane..
undefined says next goal of mine is to support l2 projects. that is the way the ecosystem HAS to go .. we will see a proliferation of l2's and a lot of consolidation imo over the next couple of years before the 'winners' metriculate to the top..  we have a lot of UI/UX build out to do as well before mainstream adoptation can take place.. I was trying to explain it all to a non-techie the other day.. it's not an easy task.. i tried to explain that all the complexities will eventually be abstracted away from the end-user.. you'll just use an app - like we use paypal or zelle or venmo right now - and transact with one another.. the back end system for them will be immaterial..  but we know .. we know.. lol !!!!
undefined says anyway have a fantastic day. I need to go do some irl work..!
undefined says Haha, enjoy a fantastic day too!
undefined says Hello everyone.
I am going to deposit ETH from Ethereum to Aribtrum.
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing
I have made the smart contract that sends ETH to arbitrum when the user pays.
It will go on arbitrum testnet if I use inbox.createRetryableTicket function.
But the problem is that I can’t see any ETH on my arbitrum testnet explorer.
Anyone can help me?
undefined says but this risk - as i understand it - isn't unique to L2s, the who controls the L1 contract risk persists independent of where the contract is deployed correct?
undefined says Yes. That’s why I tried to phrase it as:

“That is the biggest risk for using **any L1 contract**, including the one that bridges assets to L2s.”

Anytime you use a contract (in any blockchain) you have to understand if another entity can upgrade it and steal your funds.

It’s important to call that risk out for L2s specifically though since you are always supposed to have access to your funds even if the L2 shuts down, but for upgradable L2 deposit contracts, the network could get shutdown and the owners could upgrade the contract to steal your funds.
undefined says thanks for the context and i appreciate you sharing your views
undefined says i myself spent a ton of time today going through contracts that ive approved and unapproving them as needed 🙂
undefined says hi everyone, is it possible to deploy smart contracts on ethereum mainnet using arbitrum?
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs 
Anyone can help me?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#retryable-transaction-lifecycle

You probabably didn't include enough gas for the transaction to finish, you'll need to redeem the retryable ticket to finish the transaction
undefined says ```
inbox.createRetryableTicket{value: (msg.value / 4)}(
                msg.sender,
                0,
                _maxSubmissionCost,
                msg.sender,
                msg.sender,
                0,
                0,
                "0x"
            );
```
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs This is part of my smart contract.
Could you please take a look what I am wrong with gas?
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs 
Once I deposit ETH from my smart contract to Arbitrum, it's going to Arbitrum's alias address. 
So I can't control deposited ETH on arbitrum. 
Could you please let me know what I am wrong?
undefined says I'm not a solidity developer, so I'm not going to review your code.  Seems like you need to read the documentation, this is how you deposit ETH:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#depositing-eth-via-retryables
undefined says Is there anybody can support me in this community?
undefined says have you tried calling depositEth instead of createRetryableTicket?
undefined says Yes, I tried
undefined says can you provide a transaction number?
undefined says https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x0b60b53b679f779243a63878b37413a3a76576dc58ec81f76b0da9cff6c4207f
undefined says In this transaction, 0.025 eth goes with depositEth function
the another 0.025 eth goes with createRetryableTicket function.
undefined says max submission cost is too low
undefined says The fund is going on the following address on arbitrum.
L2_Alias = L1_Contract_ Address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111
undefined says the maximum submission cost was set too low, so the retryable wasn't created.
undefined says How can I get the current maximum submission cost?
undefined says use bridge.arbitrum.io 😄
undefined says it is open source, so you can see how it does it
undefined says Thanks for your help. I will try to resolve myself. 🙂
undefined says How can I obtain the latest state root of the arbitrum state merkle trie on L1?
undefined says So that I can verify merkle proofs of data in arbitrum’s L2 state using an L1 contract
undefined says Hi, it seems your MaxGas and MaxPrice is 0, if those are 0, the redeem tx won’t run automatically, you need to call this https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbretryabletx , and if you want to let it run immediately after your retryable ticket is created, you need input the Maxgas and MaxPrice, here is how to get it: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/rpc-utils/nodeinterface#estimateretryableticketaddress-sender-uint256-deposit-address-destaddr-uint256-l2callvalue-uint256-maxsubmissioncost-address-excessfeerefundaddress-address-callvaluerefundaddress-uint256-maxgas-uint256-gaspricebid-bytes-data-→-uint256-uint256-external , as for those address on arbitrum, here is the address table:  https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Yes, you can call https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbsys#sendtxtol1address-destination-bytes-calldataforl1-→-uint256-external , but it need 7days to go to l1.
undefined says Here is the latest block state staked by validator(but this maybe a little slow compare to the latest state ordered by sequencer), https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-eth/rollup/rollupcore#laststakeblock-→-uint256-public
undefined says Awesome, thank you Jason!
undefined says Quick question: I am failing to understand how validators are selected to propose rollup blocks. (Is there some sort of consensus mechanism ?)
undefined says Hi, there are 3 types of validators, which is Active Validator, Defensive Validator and Watchtower Validator. Active Validator is a party who makes staked, disputable assertions about the state of the Arbitrum chain, Defensive Validator is a validator that watches the Arbitrum chain and takes action (i.e., stake and challenges) only when and if an invalid assertion occurs. Watchtower Validator is a validator that never stakes / never takes on chain action, who raises the alarm (by whatever off-chain means it chooses) if it witnesses an invalid assertion.
undefined says Thanks, I get that part but which one of the active validators has the right to propose a block ?
undefined says if two active validators make a disputable assumption at the same time which one will be selected ?
undefined says Or is there only one active validator which is Offchain Labs ?
undefined says in which case I don't understand what the incentives are to run a node because the only time you could actually challenge a block is if they made an honest mistake (I wouldn't imagine them acting maliciously)
undefined says thanks bro💪 and as calldata what i should pass? the bytecode of my smart contract?
undefined says What function’s calldata?
undefined says sendTxToL1(address destination, bytes calldataForL1) → uint256 (external)
undefined says No, it’s normal tx’s calldata, you can find on every tx page on etherscan which is called input data.
undefined says It includes the functions name’s hash and your parameters transfer to that function.
undefined says oh ok, so how can i deploy my smart contract? 🥲
undefined says Use hardhat, truffle or remix are ok.
undefined says Sorry for missing your message, currently only offchainlabs run validator, and for your second question, they all will be selected but there will be a challenge between them, and this is 1/n model so the honest validator will always win.
undefined says so i just connect to arbitrum chain and deploy it and it will land on ethereum mainnet? sorry a bit confused
undefined says You can run your own node to get the correct state if you don’t trust others rpc, but your nodes currently can’t be a validator to state.
undefined says You mean call sendTxToL1(address destination, bytes calldataForL1) → uint256 (external) to deploy contract on l1?
undefined says yeah
undefined says You’d better not use this way to deploy contracts, the gas cost will be higher than your direct deploy to l1
undefined says oh 😦 is there any cheaper way?
undefined says i really want to deploy it but it cost a f lot
undefined says its about 1M gas
undefined says its for interacting with a dapp on eth mainnet
undefined says Perhaps there is no cheap way to deploy contracts on l1.
undefined says alr, thanks for help
undefined says Makes sense now ! thanks a lot
undefined says gogo
undefined says Hey guys, I'm wondering if that's necessary for a private Arbitrum network to have all three types of nodes (aggregator, sequencer, forwarder) or I can have just one that suits my functionality?
Thanks
undefined says Do arbitrum transaction topics work the same as mainnet? Im trying to find swaps by checking events, but Im not finding the topic in the logs.

Am I missing something?
undefined says The address aliasing docs [1] note:

```
The Arbitrum protocol's usage of L2 Aliases for L1-to-L2 messages prevents cross-chain exploits that would otherwise be possible if we simply reused L1 contact addresses.
```

Curious about the scenarios that were in mind for this. Is the basic idea that if a L2 contract defines logic around the external contract being a L1 contract that executes a call via a cross-chain tx then without address aliasing in certain scenarios it would be possible to use create2 to deploy the same L1 contract code on L2 at the same address using create2? And then, that new contract could directly call the L2 contract which might result in problems if the L2 contract was expecting that call to be from L1?

undefined says Any idea how transactions in the same block are ordered and what causes them to be in the same block anyway?
undefined says You mean local network? If you don’t have such related test need, you don’t have to run all
undefined says Do you use allEvents to find? Events search from 0 to latest block is probably disabled now.
undefined says Hi, of course, arbitrum is almost Compatible with evm
undefined says Using getLogs which takes a start and end block param as well as an optional list of topics to retrieve. Even if I got all the topics Id still need to know which topic corresponds to a swap. Any way I can find that out?
undefined says You can search the docs of that dapp, they will have such guide.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs would be grateful for your assistance with this q 🙂
undefined says Also trying to understand what is the technical difference between Arbitrum Chain and Arbitrum Rollup?
undefined says I am wondering if I can start up a separate Arbitrum sidechain? At least locally
undefined says I.e. what's the ETA on this part of official docs? https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain
undefined says Hi, we currently do not have timeline for this, when we are ready, we will announce it.
undefined says Hi, random question but does someone know how much gas is used to send a Batch to l1 ?
undefined says Hi, here is etherscan information page: 0x4c6f947Ae67F572afa4ae0730947DE7C874F95Ef
undefined says cool
undefined says I can't find a more technical description of rollups. Links to "learn more" on home page are broken.
I wonder how rollups can achieve any meaningful compression of transactions?
undefined says Here is the docs： https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_basics
undefined says uestion but does someone know how much gas is used to send a Batch to l1 ?
undefined says I can't find a more technical description of rollups. Links to "learn more" on home page are broken.
I wonder how rollups can achieve any meaningful compression of transactions?
undefined says 200k gas on l1
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol#optimizations
undefined says Astroport
undefined says Any idea what this line means: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/c0881b3c325779ba9dcf0c1067d9d28b83de56fe/packages/arb-rpc-node/batcher/batcher.go#L216
undefined says The batcher in general is a component that allows someone to aggregate and post l2 transactions that isn't the sequencer (though they'll only be processed after a delay the same as deposits). It has a simple local mempool implementation and that line is how it randomly grabs things out of its mempool for inclusion. The sequencer uses a separate implementation so doesn't use that code
undefined says Why does the arbitrum exit game take ~a week? If (say) Alice and bob both run validators checking their contract or hire people to do so and believe they can catch false assertions and begin disputes within ~hours, can they just agree on a much shorter exit period?
undefined says Your assumption is that in a better situation, if most of the validators are down or other reasons occur, then we need to have enough time to challenge
undefined says Thanks for the clarity. What causes two or more transactions to end up in the same block? I've noticed this happens when there is a lot of block activity.
undefined says is it theoretically possible that the gas required for a fraud proof is higher than the max block size ?
undefined says No, bisection is efficient & happens over multiple txns
undefined says Yep, completely forgot about that part ...
undefined says Good thinking though 🙂
undefined says hi guys, hope you won't mind my call for participation in developer research. Wallet connect is a cool community and we'd love to have you involved 🙂
undefined says Hi, what can I do to help you.
undefined says .hihi
undefined says Thanks for the clarity. What causes two or more transactions to end up in the same block? I've noticed this happens when there is a lot of block activity. 
async — 今天02:06
undefined says To clarify, there isn’t a period per se.  no blocks are created if no transactions are available.  Blocks are created when a transaction is available, and there may be more than one transaction in a given block if lots of transactions are being posted.
undefined says So a transaction will initiate a block production and if other transactions are fast enough, they can get into the same block?
undefined says I read your piece about ORU and why you think its the present and the future. https://medium.com/offchainlabs/optimistic-rollups-the-present-and-future-of-ethereum-scaling-60fb9067ae87
I just started learning about RU, an I have a hard time understanding, why a fraud proof is better than a cryptographic proof. 
in the post you argued with costs and several other issues. Mainly also the fact, that ORU are live and compared to a theoretical future ZK Roll UP. 
do you have a recommendation, where to read about this more? When ZK roll ups solve their compatibility problem and lower costs, will you change your conclusion? 

would you argue that fraud proofs are in general superior to validity proofs ?
undefined says Just consider that blocks don't matter, they are completely arbitrary
undefined says Hey, guys, I am reading docs for arbitrum developers. I found the price for ArbGas, while it seem like arbgas price is always 0.01 of the estimated L1 gas price on mainnet?
undefined says Hi, when there are many tx on network, the gas price will be higher, but if it not so busy, the gas price is 1/100 of mainnet, which you can get this information from ArbGasInfo.sol(0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006C)
undefined says Hi! The cost disadvantage of ZK rollups is not going to change, for the same reason that eating one apple will always be faster than eating 1000 apples.
The compatibility issues arise because many ZK systems sacrifice compatibility in exchange for reducing their performance disadvantage--they eat 500 pears rather than 1000 apples.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  And the fixed cost of l2 tx is always 4600 l1 gas on mainnet ?
undefined says like for example as a common developer I can be sure a public API won't suddenly be shut down only in web3
this is a huge step forward in my opinion~
undefined says The problem with zk is when it can be launched, and it is nowhere to be seen at the moment.
undefined says At present, the newly launched evm is still a long way from generalization. What the market needs is a generalized solution. I feel that it will be difficult to officially release in the first half of next year.
undefined says It’s also depends on the tx number.
undefined says Yeah, "The base price of an L2 tx is CP/B, where C is the L1 cost required for an aggregator to submit an empty batch, P is the estimated L1 gas price, and (1/B) is the average (1/batchSize)."  written in the developer docs. Do you means it will be CP/B  in the future when arbitrum become busy ,  and it's a fixed number now?
undefined says Yep, contracts w/ the same addresses on the eth and arb would create the problem (in a naive implementation); doesn't even require create2 tho, could just use create on both chain with the same deployer address
undefined says :arbitrum:  very interesting chat!
undefined says How to obtain arbitrum transaction records
undefined says You can view arbiscan.it directly, if you want to obtain by code and you have related tx hash, you can send an rpc request which is `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, if you don’t know the tx hash, you can get it through arbiscan api.
undefined says Does Arbitrum have a solution for the "Random Factor" problem? Chainlink VRF exists for Ethereum, but it doesn't seem to have support for Arbitrum.
undefined says I'm having troubles remove liquidity from a uni v2 LP position? it doesn't show up on https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/v2 . is it supposed to show up?
The LP position is a FRAX/FXS: https://etherscan.io/token/0xe1573b9d29e2183b1af0e743dc2754979a40d237
undefined says Do you use a wrong network?
undefined says Will support chainlink vrf later, for now we don’t support vrf by arbitrum official.
undefined says does arbitrum have nodes with WSS providers so that developers can subscribe to see smart contract events?
undefined says Try infura or alchemy.
undefined says Hey, trying to do something simple where I get the average gas per batch. Was wondering what the difference between SequencerBatchDeliveredFromOrigin and SequencerBatchDelivered are in SequencerInbox.sol. (planning to use getLogs and use getTransactionReceipt to get gasUsed).
undefined says Hi! The cost disadvantage of ZK rollups is not going to change, for the same reason that eating one apple will always be faster than eating 1000 apples.
The compatibility issues arise because many ZK systems sacrifice compatibility in exchange for reducing their performance disadvantage--they eat 500 pears rather than 1000 apples.
undefined says Can someone help me understand how Arbitrum sequencer works? I understand that on L1 Ethereum, you send Eth to an Arbitrum smart contract (portal/gateway). Then Arbitrum confirms and credits you on L2 with equivalent amount. You can now interact with your smart contracts (or others) deployed on Arbitrum L2. When you want to withdraw, it rolls-up to L1.
undefined says Question 1 - Since Ethereum network cannot make API calls or interact with external data, in order to preserve determinism, how does Arbitrum L2 even know that a txs has occured? Using events?
undefined says how does sequencer send this info from L1 to L2?
undefined says Question 2 - who is running these sequencers? Are they centralized? are they staked?
undefined says Hi MOD,  any details for token?
undefined says Yeah, "The base price of an L2 tx is CP/B, where C is the L1 cost required for an aggregator to submit an empty batch, P is the estimated L1 gas price, and (1/B) is the average (1/batchSize)."  written in the developer docs. Do you means it will be CP/B  in the future when arbitrum become busy ,  and it's a fixed number now?
undefined says Hi, for the first question, when you deposit ETH to arbitrum, it will go to arbitrum inbox smart contract and emit an event, then l2 sequencer will read the order your tx on l2 network, then you will receive ETH on l2.
undefined says Currently, offchain labs run sequencer, but if sequencer is down, you can also send your tx to l1 inbox directly, no need to use sequencer.
undefined says When network work is busy, it will change, but most conditions it will stay 4600 gas of l1.
undefined says hello, how can i get the _data field for `outboundTransfer`  on L1GatewayRouter?
tried using getOutboundCalldata, but the bytes do not match
undefined says The verification process for @Plemonade failed, run the command again in a few moments.
undefined says Does Arbitrum have mirroring
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/61c252385d3481168f50b6ee8ff9720d6230c328/packages/arb-ts/src/lib/l1Bridge.ts#L324
undefined says You mean a mirror you can download arbitrum full node from?
undefined says Hi, what can I help you?
undefined says anyone aware of any level 2 statistical comparisons?
undefined says like adoption rates etc
undefined says I've been very impressed w abritrum
undefined says https://l2beat.com
undefined says yes
undefined says I need a mirror you can download arbitrum full node
undefined says can anyone point me to an article that probably describe in layman terms how ETH kept in arbitrum for very long period could be safe for the unforeseeable future? Even until arbitrum bridge cease to exist?
undefined says hey. if zapper says i have tokens in a farm, how do I find it?  it says one of my wallets has about $600 farming $CAKE on BSC, but on pancakeswap it doesn't seem i'm farming anything
undefined says We have snapshot may help you： Mainnet:
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says Here is how arbitrum rollups work：https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbitrum-rollup-protocol
undefined says You can view it on bscscan, and then search your address, you will find your coin.
undefined says Hi all, really noob question here. Please feel free to point me to some docs.

_where/who do the txn fees on Arbitrum go to? Is it distributed across the different types of nodes participating?_
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#fees 😉
undefined says I was following the local dev env setup docs https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart which mentioned Docker, I found the docker images https://hub.docker.com/u/offchainlabs but are there any pointers on how to use them with the pet shop dapp?
undefined says we are not supporting creating local chains right now, easiest to just use the arbitrum chain on rinkeby to deploy pet shop dapp
undefined says good to know, thanks, perhaps add this to the docs?
undefined says Thanks sir! 👍
undefined says apart from https://arbiscan.io/ , do you have any explorers that provide charts and stats on transactions, no, of users etc?
undefined says We have this can also provide those stats: https://explorer.arbitrum.io
undefined says Hi, what can I help you?
undefined says Oh, I got it.
undefined says For L2 —> L1 messaging / interoperability what is the current amount of time needed to send a message? I think I also read, it’s possible to read from the sequencer providing faster semi trustworthy finality?

We need this to provide proof of burn of tokens on L2 to an L1 smart contract. Ideally this would be fast and not take like 7 days
undefined says Hi, currently it need 8 days for a message transfer from l2 to l1.
Sequencer do provide fast finality, but it is l2 state finality, not l2 message transfer to l1 fast finality,. But if you want to provide l1 a fast proof that l2 token has been burned, I would recommend you use oracle to meet the service.
undefined says Thanks for the reply! Any oracle service you can recommend? I the cellar bridge has something like this right?
undefined says You can see if chainlink has this job id or you can set up your project’s own oracle.
undefined says Awesome! Thanks so much
undefined says These are hugely important features together w the fast bridges like HOP. A lot of ppl get detracted from using roll ups because they think everything takes a week from L2 to L1, but there are a ton of solutions just hard to find them for each use case
undefined says Yes, those bridges can provide fast token transfer using liquidity, this is very important for users.
undefined says Thanks for your help! Looking forward to rolling out our first Arb1 Dapp very soon! 🙂
undefined says Np, look forward to hear your good news!
undefined says hi Where to get more information about Arbitrum's decentralised serialiser
hello
undefined says This is related paper(https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf ), but the final plan has not decided yet.
undefined says Thanks so much
undefined says I have a couple of questions:
- What is the difference between a sequencer and an aggregator? 
- I understand a user can just post their L2 tx the L1 inbox, what stops a user from submitting multiple transactions (effectively sequencing / aggregating his own transactions)
- Who currently runs aggregators / sequencers?
- How is the fact that users can submit their own transactions handled by Dapps? Im guessing most just rely on an RPC, but is that the sequencer state or the the inbox state (true state in my understanding) ?
undefined says Chainlink vrf have not supported arbitrum yet.
undefined says Hi, for the first question, sequencer is a node which can give you fast confirmation, while aggregator can not. For the second question, if some congestion or other situations comes to those node, user can submit tx directly into the inbox, which means if arbitrum node can not touch, you can still interact with arbitrum, if ethereum still works, arbitrum works. Currently only offchainlabs run sequencer. The rpc state you get is sequencer state.
undefined says Hi, polygon is a side chain while arbitrum is a rollups network. The safety of rollups network is better than side chain because rollups depend on ethereum mainnet, it’s safety is almost equal to ethereum.
undefined says thanks for the answers (and happy new year!), following up on that, is there any reason other parties can't run a sequencer?
Also, could you dive deeper into the differences between sequencer and aggregator?
undefined says Sequencer is very important to the rollups network, because sequencer will manage state and anti-Mev, so offchainlabs choose to run sequencer own, but in the future, we will have decentralized sequencer, which we have do a further research(such as https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf ).
For the second question, sequencer only run on sequencer mode, if a rollups network is on this mode, the inbox will have inbox(slow inbox) and sequencer inbox(fast inbox), the aggregator can only send tx to slow inbox and can not give user a fast confirmation, because it needs to wait for some blocks until the slow inbox is opened by sequencer and include to the network state. For more details: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#sequencer-mode
undefined says got it, so its not permissionless to run a sequencer now for MEV reasons
undefined says Not only mev reasons.
undefined says What are some other possible reasons?
undefined says Because sequencer has very strong power to the network, before we announce decentralized sequencer, we still run this own.
undefined says Hi, new here. I'm sure this question is asked often...but why this outrageous fee and 7 days to bridge off arbitrum to mainnet? I need to back to my exchange to sell for usd, asap?
undefined says The 7 days wait period is a core Pillar of optimistic rollups. The fee is probably just ethereum gas?
Your best bet is probably to swap with someone on L1 or find a bridge that does that
undefined says My question is how is Offchain labs going to make money? Collecting fees as sequencer? But once that gets decentralised?
undefined says You want me to look for " Someone" to was with on L1? What does that mean? What other bridges are there? I bridged using Your Arb bridge t... can you suggest any other bridges that will not quote a 200,000 gew gas fee?
undefined says * Sawp
undefined says Swap
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.one/
https://www.arbiproject.io/projects
Those two websites have bridge page, you can choose one to transfer your assets.
undefined says As a Retail user,  Experimenting , This " Core Pillar" is an inconvenience relative to other EVM para-chains and L2s.
undefined says Yes, I understand what you think , but we set this is to make sure your funds and the rollups network in a safety state, we do not want to  provider user a unsafe network just because convenience.
You can try 3rd party bridge next time, it won’t take so long.
undefined says Thank you for your Answer ... needs to be more efficient then a Wire transfer from a bank that takes 3 days
undefined says Hmmm so withdrawal from rollup to CEX will also take 7 days?
undefined says Only from Arbitrum to Ethereum using our rollup bridge. There are plenty of third party bridges that work super quickly
undefined says sorry I don't understand why L2 -> CEX doesn't need challenge period. For large withdrawals or several smaller in one block there could be a huge risk
undefined says are you expecting that CEX will run watchtower or something?
undefined says Because the target address you transfer to cex is on l2.
undefined says While you bridge token is transfer to another network.
undefined says Cex is running their full node to check tx.
undefined says Yeah but who can know for sure what is the real balance on L2 before the challange period is over
undefined says I guess this is the canonical answer
undefined says Others network will still be re-org or forked, but cex still do not wait so long to wait it finalized, they just wait for enough block confirmed is ok.
undefined says And if they run their full node, they will know if there is cheating tx on the network, so they do not need to wait for 7days.
undefined says Gas amounts per opcode/data seems to be quite different from Arbitrum than main net or other side chains. I read your gas docs but since the instruction set is so different from a vanilla VM, I find it hard to get an intuitive understanding for how to optimize gas which is important for me as a developer.
https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/1480#discussioncomment-1896406
Are there any rules of thumb? I would imagine that calldata is A LOT more expensive compared to other opcodes than it is on L1 because you need to actually write the calldata to L1 whereas execution is "basically for free"?
undefined says Like a rule of thumb that I eventually understood in Ethereum is: don't use `SSTORE` unless you absolutely have to because it gets you absolutely rekt in gas fees. Now looking at your table there's no `SSTORE` op code and it's not so clear to the pleb dev like myself `wat pay to store 32byte` ?
undefined says then: How does storing 32bytes compare to a just logging 32bytes in an event or passing 32bytes into calldata
undefined says If I submit a transaction now through the slow inbox (and assuming the sequencer delta_blocks is 10 minutes), will its execution be delayed for 10 minutes? (as the indexer would backdate all transactions 10 minutes from now to be earlier than mine in the inbox)
undefined says also related question, what is the difference between a block and a message in the inbox? I understand that a message in the inbox is some computation to be performed (1 or more transactions), but that anyone can submit to it, while to propose blocks you need to stake (how is blocktime determined btw?)
undefined says Is there any document (or code) to demonstrate reading Arbi L2 header from L1 eth?
undefined says Hi, sstore is also expensive on arbitrum, it is 1/10 cost compare to l1. As for calldata cost, if you can reduce your calldata length on l2, the gas cost for calldata on l1 will also be reduced, but we will update arbitrum one to nitro, at that time, the calldata format will be different.
undefined says If you view etherscan’s advanced info page of a tx, you will find there are 4 cost type, execution is one of them.
undefined says 1.Yes
2.the block on arbitrum has 2 types, one is sequencer block, which is proposed by sequencer, when sequencer receive a tx from user or read tx from slow inbox, it will propose, and on arbiscan you see is sequencer block, another type is rollups block, this was proposed by validators, they will stake funds and make a promise that the state is true, others can read from l1’s inbox and re-compute those tx to the get state, if they find validator is cheating, they can challenge.
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0xC12BA48c781F6e392B49Db2E25Cd0c28cD77531A#readProxyContract
undefined says I think I should've asked here first, instead of general
undefined says Are the gas fees paid by the l1 contract arbitrum sequencer in essence the gas fees paid by users of Arbitrum One?
undefined says and a second question: Is there a way to quantify the amount of l2 tx's that are included in a batch?
undefined says Yes, those part is `L1 Fixed Cost` and `L1 Calldata Paid`, which you can see at advanced page of a tx on arbiscan.
undefined says Ah, thanks for sharing, I didn't even notice the advanced tab
undefined says So just so I can make sure that I understand correctly
undefined says https://etherscan.io/tx/0x289c616cd61a1b25293935668de4a265901db91ca17596c19eee339fdbaff772
undefined says this L1 tx here has a tx fee of 0.08 eth
undefined says and that 0.08eth is from a bunch of l2 tx's, right?
undefined says and I can see information about those L2 tx's by looking at the data present in the l1 tax
undefined says And for second question, everytime the batches posted to l1’s gas cost is around 1,200,000, but every single tx’s calldata cost is different, so it’s hard to estimate how many tx are included.
undefined says Yeah, I figured that would be the case, that it would be too hard to estimate
undefined says On arbiscan not etherscan, just like this: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xd2f26b609edb199aa19453a2c0aba531559fb8734ed3a25cea4af5be45ba478a#txninfo
undefined says haha ya, I got that thank you 🙂
undefined says Np.
undefined says so if I wanted to calculate arbitrum one fees over a period of time
undefined says I would look at the fees paid in the l1 sequencer contract, right?
undefined says Use eth_estimateGas is better
undefined says what are the return parameters of this method `getPricesInArbGas` https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/71320feebdbbb77e3cf09bba05995361982ba2b3/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L25
undefined says I intend to get/calculate the L1 fixed fee in Arbgas and L1 calldata total fee charged in Arbgas
undefined says if so, you need call `getPricesInWeiWithAggregator`, the first return is what you need.
undefined says L1 calldata fee in total can not get by this way, you need get the unit fee, and multiply your calldata size.
undefined says Oh, and for the aggregator param, I see a `ArbAggregator.getDefaultAggregator` method that can give me an address. Would that causes any issues if a different aggregator (who is not default) authors the batch.
The use case I'm on is to repay a keeper with fair amount of USDC that they paid for gas. Is it possible for defaultAggregator to have higher fee, while in practice the fee is less? (which would result in keeper getting more USDC than they should)
undefined says Nope, the gas fee is decided by network, and don’t worry if it will be higher.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thanks for answering questions here, that's awesome!
I see a possible frontrunning / MEV opportunity but there's a few sub questions to get there:
1. I can use the L1 delayed inbox to force-include txs into L2 myself (no sequencer needed) but there's a ~10min delay for the normal sequencer to get priority to settle L2 txs on L1. That sequencer priority treatment prevents any rando on L1 from "stealing my highly perishable Uniswap L2 trade" and replace it by their own txs (MEV) which gets force included. Correct?
2. There's a max ~10min time delay between L2 fees being paid to the sequencer and the sequencer paying the L1 fees themselves and that presents an market risk in terms of L1 gas prices to the sequencer, correct?
3. In that case what does the sequencer do in terms of HIGHLY and suddenly increasing L1 base fees (say yet another NFT drop). Does the sequencer absorb the cost to keep the 10min cadence or does it delay L1 settlement and therefore time intervals between L1 anchorings (maybe I made up that word?) are > 10min.
4. In case of the latter, some L1 users could have huge MEV opportunities by replacing profitable L2 txs retrospectively. Correct?
undefined says Where can I see the number of CL price feeds that are currently live?
undefined says https://docs.chain.link/docs/arbitrum-price-feeds/
undefined says Hi everyone,

Sorry for the maybe dumb question, but I struggle with something:
How do I find, on the L1 (therefore ETH) blockchain the transaction that is at the origin of some movement on the L2 blockchain ?

I tried looking for the address on the ETH blockchain, but it does not exist, neither does the address with the alias undone (removing the 0x111100...001111 offset).

As far as I understand, everything that happens on the L2 blockchain is deterministically caused by a move on the L1 blockchain. My question is how can I see the correspondence ?
undefined says Thanks in advance for any pointers.
undefined says I would have liked to give an example but pasting seems disabled (or maybe it's a discord bug on my end)
undefined says Hi, everyone want to submit a tx to l2 has 2 different ways, first is you can send tx calldata directly to l1 inbox, and you can also send tx to sequencer, and it will combine many tx and then send it to sequencer inbox on l1, here is the address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Hi, Arb-os keeps a running average of an L1 gas price estimate. There are multiple L1 actions that add another sample reading to this.
undefined says For examples, it can get the last batches tx gas cost, and then user pay the price of last batches.
undefined says Hi JasonWan, thank you very much. Is there any way, given a L2 transaction, to find the transaction to the inbox on L1 that caused the L2 transaction to happen, or must I sweep through the call data of all the calls to inbox until I find something relevant ?
undefined says I have the same questions for outgoing transactions. Once I find a transaction that burns some WETH on L2, I assume this is because they'll be redeemable on L1. How can I find the call to the outbox that credits those ETH back to an L1 beneficiary ?
undefined says Thanks in advance, I appreciate the help
undefined says After you call arbsys to send message to l1, the ArbOS will gather those messages and merklizes them, then push the tree root to l1 outbox, next time you can get a proof and then call outbox, you will get your token on l1.
undefined says In this case what I would like to do is audit a transaction I did not make. How can I find the call to outbox on L1 given a "burn" transaction on L2 ?
undefined says but (relating to my question 2) that means the sequencer takes a market risk in gas prices, right? So at t0=0 I pay $1 worth of ETH for my L2 tx, immediately after L1 BaseFee goes up 3x and now the sequencer has to pay $3 for inclusion of my tx on L1 (so the total batch is gonna get real pricey) at t1=10min. Would the sequencer just try to wait out this surge in fees or would Offchain Labs just pay the difference and be nice to users?
undefined says Hi, for this question, you need set up a node with a flag, here is the docs: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/releases/tag/v1.0.0
undefined says Hi, I will give you an example, t0-t1 is last sequencer batches, the batches’ gas used on l1 is around 1.2m, the gas price is 80gwei, then if you send a tx to sequencer during t1-t2, however this time the gas price is 120gwei, but the sequencer will only take you 80gwei, then batches the tx to l1, then when t2-t3, the sequencer will take the price on t1-t2, which is 120 Gwei, so there is almost no risk of sequencer. This is an example, on real occasion will be a little different.
undefined says OK, this is super relevant. Thank you very much 🙂
undefined says Np
undefined says ok understood - so the sequencer does take risk but since sometimes it overcharges and sometimes it undercharges it averages out. But still, if (for whatever reason) the sequencer is unable to post a tx for 10 minutes (DoS, out of funds, censorship, whatever works), I could replace a L2 transaction via the direct inbox with my own tx, right? (thinking about taking over someone's profitable Uniswap trade as an example)
undefined says If you can not connect to sequencer, you can still send tx to inbox directly.
undefined says Arbitrum network will always online.
undefined says hi
undefined says Hi, what can I help you?
undefined says Hi, building a dapp and would like to reinforce trust for our users by participating as an honest validator.  What's the process for becoming an approved validator?  Looking at our beta in ~2 months, would general participation be open in March?  Would love to be a part of the network asap!  plz lmk
undefined says can anyone explain why arbi gas fees got cheaper?
undefined says Hi, currently we do not open the validator registration, please note our announcements in the future.
undefined says Hi, arbitrum’s gas will depends on ethereum, if ETH gas fee became cheaper, arbitrum gas will be cheaper too.
undefined says Wen nitro?
undefined says Will announce soon.
undefined says hi, could someone explain why withdrawal to Arbitrum from cex Gate.io cost 0.031 eth, but to ERC20 cost 0.011eth?
undefined says Hi, this is decided by Gate.io, we don’t know about this.
undefined says how much gas is required to deploy a smart contract to arbitrum
undefined says depends on the smart contract fren
undefined says Can't seem to deploy a contract to the testnet - getting "not enough funds for gas" from the rpc even though there is plenty
undefined says an nft smart contract
undefined says it gives me the gas of 0.17 eth
undefined says thought that was a bit much for arbitrum but idk
undefined says How many NFTs r u minting
undefined says Hi, how many gas estimate you got to deploy it?
undefined says I'm using dapp.tools - I can deploy to my local eth testnet.

```
export ETH_GAS=2000000
export ETH_GAS_PRICE=12728576
export ETH_RPC_URL=https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc
```
undefined says https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/seth#seth-send
undefined says Do I need to set ETH_PRIO_FEE to use EIP-1559
undefined says ?
undefined says I only have 0.089 test arb, but that should be enough based on the gas price and gas limit
undefined says This is the contract repo:
https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-solidity
undefined says Are you using a static amount of gas?
undefined says You can use eth_estimateGas
undefined says I think 2m gas maybe not enough to deploy it since arbgas is different from ETH gas.
undefined says okay thanks
undefined says I'll experiment some more
undefined says I got it to work - had to set the gas to 20m
undefined says the error message from the rpc was confusing me
undefined says Here explains why arbgas is different from ETH gas: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas
undefined says I'm using the `getStorageGasAvailable()`, but it returns 0 all the time even if there are some slots being initialized before or after
undefined says Tried this on testnet:
https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0xa38213a3d08aa7db2593826373315e9a40d92b89c20e57a9a01492fa376678e7#eventlog
event index 2 is `Uint(string="getStorageGasAvailable", uint256=0)`
after that there are 2 slot initializations
then event index 28 is `Uint(string="getStorageGasAvailable", uint256=0)`
undefined says My goal is to estimate the following information
L2 Storage Used: 2 slots
L2 Storage Paid: 0.000002392296122722 ETH
How can I get this info in the smart contract? Is there any other method available?
undefined says hi
undefined says Hi, it do return 0 now, will ask team and give you feedback.
undefined says are there any code samples for uniswap v3 on arbitrum?
undefined says Same as mainnet.
undefined says @Denisa ^^
undefined says hey y'all, I have 2 questions regarding the protocol:
1) which entity is doing batching of L2 txs into L1? is it Sequencer or something different? IIUC it is not Validator
2) is it correct to apply term "finality" to Arbitrum's L2 txs? can I say that time-to-finality = withdrawal-delay = 1 week?
undefined says 2') is it possible that non-fraudulent transactions get reorganized?
undefined says Yes just tried again, the method still returns zero even if there are storage initializations.
 https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0xb11926139eddab7c0b7e34948b9498bd7e5f928dc58c6ac4122c9b51e12e1345#ContentPlaceHolder1_collapseContent

```
 function trySstore() public {
    Arbitrum.printStuff();

    assembly {
        sstore(1, 2)
        sstore(3, 2)
    }

    Arbitrum.printStuff();
}
```

console output:
```
log#2  Uint(str="getStorageGasAvailable", val=0) // log index before sstore
log#28 Uint(str="getStorageGasAvailable", val=0) // after sstore
```
undefined says Maybe not the best time to ask, but I'm wondering if we can't turn sequencer mode off for arbitrum in times like this. Having MEV risk and slow finality is still better than being completely down.
undefined says pretty cool how it all works huh..   im learning the model. im a network stack guy, not a dev. what do you do for a living ?
undefined says yea the bankless podcast with the team really turned me on to the possibilities with arbitrum. I'm a data engineer. 6 years ago it was a lot of distributed systems stuff but now it's mostly SQL and making data scientist's stuff work 😢
undefined says you dont enjoy it ?
undefined says Nah not really but that’s for a number of reasons. Some day this crypto stuff will save me 😆
undefined says well... im gonna tell you a secret.. there are so many opportunities right now for big brains.. if you find yourself really passionate about any particular aspect / part of the crypto ecosystem you know you can jump over pretty easily..
undefined says i am forming a crypto consulting business now.  already met with 3 attorneys and flying out to miami to meet some more end of month.   there is an overwhelming thirst for people like you and me who are on the  "inside" of this culture  to bridge the gap to mainstream advisors ..
undefined says gonna dm you an invite to my discord.  if you wanna talk shop stuff lmk.  we probably don't need to have a full on convo here 🙂 . lol
undefined says Hi, 1. currently when send tx to arbitrum rpc node, your tx will be pushed to sequencer, and when sequencer get enough tx, it will send the tx batch to ethereum.
2. As for the finality, you can read this article: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
3. There is no reorganized on arbitrum network, because if there is a honest node on arbitrum, you can always get the correct state.
undefined says Hi, we are working to make sure the sequencer more stability, and if sequencer down, users can still send tx by inbox, so there is no completely down.
undefined says Will give you feedback soon.
undefined says Need a little help here. I moved some USDT into arbitrum and bridged. I checked arbiscan and it's there, but when I connect my wallet on sushiswap, it doesn't display my USDT for swapping. Can anyone help me troubleshoot?
undefined says I'm trying not to get frustrated after paying the fees and it's not displaying like it's suppose to be.
undefined says Hi, can you paste the usdt address on sushiswap? You will see it
undefined says Got it Thanks
undefined says Np.
undefined says 
undefined says So I'm confused about this. Is this correct? Can a state transition of the Arbitrum VM occur without a sequencer running? Or can someone change the state of a smart contract on Arbitrum without a sequencer being online?
undefined says Hi, it’s correct, you have 2 ways to send tx on l2, first is sequencer, second is l1’s inbox contract, when sequencer you can’t touch to, you can choose to send tx to inbox, the state is decided by inbox’s tx, not the sequencer’s vm, because those fullnode can also read from l1’s inbox and sequencer inbox to get tx’s calldata and compute them to get the latest state.
undefined says so if I interact with a contract on Arbitrum using the inbox contract before the sequencer comes back online, my transactions will get confirmed first?
undefined says not sure what you mean by "those full node"?
undefined says Sure.
undefined says Fullnode will maintain the state of l2 and can relay the tx to sequencer.
undefined says that's not really clear to me. Are you saying the full node will actually execute the transaction?
undefined says or do I still need to wait for the sequencer to come back online and then act on the information passed by the full node?
undefined says Maybe this article can help you to understand fullnode: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#full-nodes
undefined says Simple example, let's say I have funds in Aave on Arbitrum. The Arbitrum sequencer suddenly goes offline for an extended period of time. I want to take my funds out of Aave. Can I do that without the sequencer? Or can I just post a request in the inbox and wait for the sequencer to go back online?
undefined says You can send tx to inbox without wait sequencer goes online.
undefined says How does the ordering work if the sequencer comes back online while my regular inbox transaction is getting confirmed? Let's say if I sent a transaction to execute a Uniswap trade using the L1 inbox, but while it is getting confirmed the sequencer comes back and wants to process a trade on the same asset?
undefined says when sequencer come back，it will read l1 inbox and update it’s state.
undefined says Just to be clear, does "send to the inbox" mean "execute and achieve finality"?  Or does it just mean "queue and wait for sequencer to come back"?
undefined says For the sake of discussion, lets assume the sequencer *never* comes back.  Can trades on Arbiswap still happen, achieve finality, and then the proceeds of those trades can be withdrawn to L1?
undefined says > submitting a batch is permissionless, so any user can, say, submit a single transaction "batch" if the need arises; Arbitrum thereby inherits the same censorship resistance as the Ethereum.
Hmm, I vaguely remember the sequencer being permissioned at Arbitrum launch?  Is that incorrect, or has it since *become* permissionless?
undefined says When you send tx to inbox, your tx will be confirmed, because l2 is just a execution layer, it can not decide the state, the state is decide by the tx calldata in inbox, anyone can read from inbox and compute then to get the latest state.
undefined says Right, but for withdraws to happen that state needs to be "published" on L1.
undefined says Sequencer is run by offchainlabs, but we are working on decentralized sequencer, when this is done, sequencer will be permissionless.
undefined says The behavior I'm interested in (and maybe @experience as well) is the behavior *today* (not hypothetical future).
undefined says Lets say the sequencer *today* goes offline and never returns (Offchain labs gets nuked from orbit, or wrench attacked by the USG).  Can people still trade on Arbiswap and withdraw the proceeds of those trades to L1?
undefined says this seems to mean that the transaction doesn't actually gets executed before the sequencer comes back
undefined says Anyone can execute the l1’s tx calldata and get the latest state.
undefined says Of course.
undefined says Yes, but you cannot submit a state update to L1, which is required to withdraw.
undefined says Only the permissioned sequencer (at the moment) can submit that state update, so if it never comes back then you can never withdraw your updated balance.
undefined says Update a validated state is done by validator, not sequencer.
undefined says If you run a honest full node you do not need to wait for the validated state.
undefined says Are "active validator"s permissionless today?
undefined says Docs say
> For the flagship Arbitrum chain, Offchain Labs will run an active validator.
But it isn't clear that anyone can do it today (because what is in the docs doesn't fully align with what is on mainnet).
undefined says Validators have white list to join in.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs This seems to be going more or less in circles :/
undefined says there's a bunch of information given that is confusing and seems somewhat conflicting
undefined says getting the latest state is one thing, but the question is, can anyone actually trigger the state transition without the sequencer (or a whitelisted "active validator") being online?
undefined says The state is decided when tx is in inbox, because anyone can execute it, even if you find validator assert a wrong state, you can ignore them or even challenge it.
undefined says I think the answer to that is no.  IIUC, what matters here are active validators (not the sequencer).  If they are whitelisted, and the whitelisted active validators go offline, then you cannot trade and withdraw to L1 (or pull liquidity and then withdraw to L1).
undefined says that's my understanding too. It seems that the only thing you can actually *do* and *finalize* without an active validator being online is initiate an emergency withdraw of ETH from an EOA on Arbitrum to an EOA on L1
undefined says I was incorrectly under the assumption that sequencers were submitting L1 state updates, but this appears to be incorrect.  It is the active validators that submit L1 state updates.  That being said, they are still permissioned, so the system isn't censorship resistant.
undefined says but I'm confused by what an active validator actually is, and how many active validators there are right now
undefined says Does Arbitrum have emergency ETH (or token?) withdraws?
undefined says An active validator is the person that submits the latest state root to L1.
undefined says and right now there is only Offchain Labs?
undefined says Would have to look at the whitelist presumably.
undefined says Latest state is not decided by validator, but once the tx in inbox is decided, you don’t have to trust the state pushed by validator, this is a 1/n model which is if there is only 1 honest part on the network, the state can always turned to correct by the honest one.
undefined says IIRC, the problem is that active validators can troll the system.  I *believe* that the Arbitrum team believes they can solve that problem somehow, but I don't know if a complete implementation was ever found, or if it was found then if it was implemented.
undefined says You have to trust that there *exists* an honest whitelisted active validator.
undefined says Otherwise no one can publish the latest state and the chain halts (and thus you can't pull liquidity from Arbiswap and such).
undefined says If the whitelist has one address on it, and that address is lost/compelled to do bad things, then it is possible the entire system will grind to a halt (unless Arbitrum team has power to update the whitelist, in which case you have to trust they will do so).
undefined says There is no need to be a validator as anyone can deduce the state
undefined says Doesn't matter for the sake of being able to withdraw to L1.
undefined says If you are OK with your assets being permanently stuck on Arbitrum and never able to be withdrawn, then you are correct I think.  If you have a desire to be able to *eventually* withdraw to L1 (which I think most people do), then you need to trust that there is at least one honest whitelisted active validator, and one honest defensive validator.
undefined says Without the latter, the active validator(s) can lie and steal all the money.  Without the former, the chain can halt.
undefined says Sounds like there is still a misunderstanding. We understand that the state can be determined without being a whitelisted validator. Our question is specifically about processing the state. Specifically, as @Micah  was saying, if there is only 1 whitelisted active validator, and that validator goes offline, can I still withdraw funds from a contract on Arbitrum and/or withdraw to L1?
undefined says I believe the answer is that you can withdraw funds from Arbiswap (or whatever dapp on Arbitrum) but the updated state that is a result of that withdraw would not be published to L1 (because the active validators are offline) and so you would not be able to withdraw the proceeds of that trade to L1.
undefined says I may be wrong here though of course.
undefined says from the point of view of L2 being defined as having the same security as L1, that would be effectively the same as not being able to withdraw
undefined says thank you, fella, exactly what I needed to know
undefined says Hi team, I'm trying to understand which Arbitrum Ethereum contract is responsible for posting rollups back to L1. Is it "Arbitrum: Sequencer" which is posting every few minutes and incurring fees of often > $1,000
OR
is it "Arbitrum: Rollup" which posts every couple of hours and incurs fees of $100-200
undefined says or something else?
undefined says Hi, arbitrum: sequencer inbox can be used to post tx batches.
undefined says is there a reference document with the addresses for testnet + arbitrum router addresses for popular swaps (uni, sushi, pancake, etc.)?
undefined says Here may help you: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says I'm not seeing any of the swaps there; I found sushi on arbitrum mainnet 0x1b02dA8Cb0d097eB8D57A175b88c7D8b47997506 but not testnet
undefined says Or, sorry for misunderstanding, if so, you can go to arbiscan.io, And search, just like this:
undefined says thanks, that worked for arbitrum mainnet but on testnet.arbitrum.io there are no results
undefined says which doesn't make sense because I was able to wrap rinkArbETH to rinkWETH via the UI
undefined says Hi, do you want to find the router address of the swap?
undefined says yes
undefined says in particular for testnet
undefined says If so, maybe you can ask this on uniswap’s discord, I don’t know what is their address.
undefined says Hi, sorry for replying late, you need higher the gas limit, and you can see it.
undefined says Like 5m or 10m.
undefined says hi, the fraud proving window is 8 or so days so if a fraudulent block is found after 7 days, does it mean that potentially 7 days of updates would be cancelled?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says Hi team, what is the formula to calculate the cost of an Arbitrum transaction?
undefined says There are 2 ways:
1.
      l1CalldataPaid +
      l1TransactionPaid +
      l2StoragePaid +
      l2ComputationPaid
2.
      gasUsed * gasPricePaid
undefined says hi, sorry if wrong channel. when the sequencer goes down, is it still possible to post transactions to arbitrum via L1? ie interact with a smart contract to close out a position?
undefined says All withdrawals need to wait for the 7 day challenge period. You can make your desired transaction to withdraw funds through the L1 inbox
undefined says is it only withdrawals which are possible when the sequencer is down?
undefined says good question I would need to check
undefined says Let me ask a question.
Where is the user's account status stored in rollup? Is there an MPT for storing the world state here too?
undefined says Not sure about this, will check it and give you feedback soon.
undefined says Yes you can send a tx to l1 inbox.
undefined says thank you both for the help 🙂
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thx
undefined says Np.
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs is there a proper snapshot?
undefined says The snapshot currently has some issues.
undefined says Hi, the state tree and other 2 tree do exist on arbitrum, but there is a little different from ethereum mainnet due to some special l2 feature. However, we will let it be the same when arbitrum one upgrade to arbitrum nitro.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thank you
undefined says Is this state tree visible to all?
undefined says hey, had a doubt about how long it takes after i register a token on the custom gateway + router for me to be able to deposit it through the arbitrum bridge
undefined says i have 0x3Be5afEa17B5232153103c842e010d550CBd44F deployed on rinkeby with a generic custom gateway + ive registered it on the bridge and router
undefined says but the deposit button on the bridge seems to be greyed out
undefined says Yes, anyone can get the state.
undefined says Hi, you can check your l1 token address by calling `calculateL2TokenAddress` to see if it is 0x0: https://etherscan.io/address/0xcee284f754e854890e311e3280b767f80797180d#readProxyContract
undefined says yeah its 0x0
undefined says but this is on rinkeby
undefined says not on the mainnet deploy
undefined says If so, maybe you haven’t registered successful.
undefined says and it does show up on the bridge properly
undefined says just doesnt let me deposit
undefined says ah this works as well
undefined says If so, try this address: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x917dc9a69F65dC3082D518192cd3725E1Fa96cA2
undefined says yeah its set
undefined says Is your wallet on ethereum rinkeby network?
undefined says yeah
undefined says there anyway i can call deposit directly without going through the bridge ui?
undefined says You can call it through L1 gateway Router directly.
undefined says hey so i did exactly that but even though the outbound transfer went through, nothing came through the gateway on l2
undefined says i have a similar token to this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/test/TestArbCustomToken.sol on l2
undefined says and this is what ive set l2Gateway to: 0x9b014455AcC2Fe90c52803849d0002aeEC184a06
undefined says the tx on l1 is here: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x0ab0f1c7754a9937e2186fbea346ff31d54298a9eca8c1844f673be6ece97871
undefined says there anyway i can see the message being picked up on the l2 side if something does go wrong?
undefined says Hi, it seems you need to claim it by yourself due to your gas price is lower,
undefined says Here is address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
Here is claim way: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbretryabletx#redeembytes32-txid-external
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I have a question. I think our Interactive Proving mechanism is very advanced and requires less data to be uploaded than optimism's mechanism, which saves more on gas fees. But why is the GAS fee of arbitrum more expensive than that of optimism?
undefined says Hi, what you said is fraud proof, this occurs only if they is challenge happens. As for the gas fee, the gas fee on l2 includes 2 parts, one is l1 calldata and fixed fee, another is l2 computation and storage cost,  arbitrum and optimism have the same cost on the first part, but as for the second part, we focus on the security, so we make the fee a little higher to let if someone attack arbitrum should pay more attack cost, however, optimism almost let the second part fee almost equals to 0, so why our fee is a little higher, we think security is very important.
undefined says Arbitrum's L2 execution fee also only accounts for a small part of the overall fee, but the proportion is not as aggressive as theirs, and we will still maintain a certain fee in L2.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Thanks for your answer, I still don't understand.
What does it mean here is the cost of calculation and storage. The calculation is done off chain, the uploaded transaction data are stored in calldata. The difference lies in the off chain calculation a
nd storage state tree consumption? arbitrum consumes more resources in these two parts, so it needs a higher gas fee to compensate.
undefined says :arbichief:
undefined says Where is the state tree stored, on the chain?
undefined says You tx need be computed by sequencer and validators to claim the state.
undefined says Storages by arbitrum nodes.
undefined says This doc  https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas  says "a chain will be allowed to charge users a fee for ArbGas, to compensate the chain's validators for their expenses", the compensating fee comes from gas pool,  and the validators get  exactly how much they spent on  L2 computing and storage,  and the commission fee of validator is from the chain creators,  which is not distributed by smart contract,  am I right?
undefined says There are 2 addresses competing to get tx's in quickly, one addr is consistently a block earlier with less max gas allocated. Is there any reason for this? MEV related, or is there a sequencer process that prevents MEV currently on Arb?
undefined says at the moment the transaction is sent to sequencer is ordered by sequencer controlled by offchainlabs, and the sequencer’s code, the team is exploring Chainlink’s FSS to minimize MEV: https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1469051578971787271?s=21
undefined says Thank you for the information, so it is purely about getting the tx the sequencer the fastest.
undefined says I am trying to get a sense of the scale of the cost to attackers to perform delay attacks. Here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol it is stated that, in the event that the dispute resolution process is needed due to stakes on conflicting DAs, each staker is only involved in one challenge at a time, and moreover that who each staker is paired against for the challenge is just a matter of someone issuing a transaction that points to two stakers not currently in challenges that disagree (rather than there being some sort of random selection process or something). So it seems like in the worst case an attacker could stake one deposit on an incorrect outcome and n deposits on the current outcome using different addresses. Then there will only ever be one challenge at a time, as there is only the one stake that disagrees with the others, so honest participants can’t really get in on a "feeding frenzy". However, the attacker could conceivably pay enough gas so that the incorrect DA is paired against one of her other malicious stakes for n periods in a row, causing the stake with the right answer to nonetheless lose for example by timing out during the interactive verification game. She loses n*(the burned half of the stake + gas), so she averages a cost of stake/2+gas per period of delay she causes. Is that a fair assessment? Or are there details I am missing that make the attack more or less expensive? Thanks!
undefined says is there a way to ensure that two transactions are included in the same block?
undefined says Hi, attacker will never win a challenge no matter how much funds it stakes, because challenge happens on l1, and l1 will recompute that DA point then outcomes the right state, so the attacker will always lose.
undefined says Perhaps not.
undefined says 1
undefined says hi, anyone can tell me how validators get paid for their L2 computing?
undefined says I found this, but no details
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas
undefined says Validators make money by slashing the stakes of their dishonest peers
undefined says Btw re GitHub, rust came out with a new version a few hours ago https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/01/13/Rust-1.58.0.html
undefined says Thanks, Rachel.  got it.   BTW,  Does ArbOS suggest using rust stable version?  I used 1.60.0-nightly server days ago and everything works fine.
undefined says The mini compiler should work on most recent versions of rust. The mexe you build, ArbOS, isn’t a rust program but rather an assembly executable the Arbitrum node software emulates
undefined says I see.  I didn't run the node from Arb master branch yet, but the sequence2 long time ago.   Another question, if all the validators work honestly,  how do we give validators the incentive to take part in?
undefined says First, we must recognize that Arbitrum isn’t like Bitcoin or ether in that we don’t need some majority like 51% to be honest. A singular honest validator is sufficient to secure the system, since it’s grounded in the security of L1 ETH. Hence, you need only believe that someone out there is honest (which can be you). Meeting this goal is easy, as actors like liquidity providers, big platforms, exchanges, offchain labs, etc have an interest in the continued correctness of the rollup. What’s more, capital needn’t be locked up to validate until it’s time to submit a fraud proof against a malicious party, further relaxing the burden on those who may be on the fence regarding setting up an honest validator
undefined says The incentive structure isn’t as in other systems because Arbitrum isn’t *like* other systems. We get the unique L2 advantage of using L1 miners to ground our model.
undefined says yeah, make sense, and the stockholders maybe the validators. And what's more, the consensus comes from both the txs' ordering and txs' verification. and by using  assertion protocol, one honest validator can make sure the correctness of the rollup.  Thanks a billion, Rachel,
undefined says Anytime!
undefined says :sayori: :SCALEIT:
undefined says but how do you ensure the  stake that sequencers put up to create blocks is higher than value of transaction in it?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#fees
undefined says 
undefined says "If the transaction was submitted by an aggregator, ArbOS collects these base fees for L2 tx and L1 calldata, and credits that amount immediately to the aggregator. ArbOS also adds a 15% markup and deposits those funds into the network fee account, to help cover overhead and other chain costs. If the transaction was not submitted by an aggregator, ArbOS collects only the 15% portion and credits that to the network fee account."
undefined says The code I think is here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/arb_os/gasAccounting.mini
undefined says no I mean if a malicious sequencer is going to steal X$ of funds but their stake that'll get slashed is smaller then $X then what?
undefined says In general,  this is why Arb need a fair sequencer like FSS.
undefined says no I mean steal using an invalid transaction, not arb or MEV
undefined says assume the sequencer is malicious
undefined says I think an invalid transaction need right signature from sender,  namely sequencer here, and then the sequencer should be able to spend the money from somebody(end users) or somewhere(like escrow contract), or minting themselves.  I think  neither can be done if a fair sequencer is adopted,  and sorry I really have no idea how such a tx can be created.
undefined says This is what fraud proofs are for. If anyone challenges them, this sequencer will eventually just lose their stake, without ever making $X
undefined says Currently only offchainlabs run sequencer, and the code we use is open source, so there won’t be a steal happen, in the future, we will announce decentralized sequencer, and will use mechanism to protect this.
undefined says I'm curious about details of these mechanisms
undefined says We are still work on decentralized sequencer, will announce when it ready.
undefined says another question:  there are 7 or 8 days for finding fraud proof right. If someone finds it after 6 days, all blocks created in those 6 days need to revert?
undefined says blocks after fraudulent one
undefined says There is no revert on arbitrum, the state is determined when the tx calldata pushed to l1 inbox, the fraud proof is used to challenge a validator when it stake a wrong state. And if there are honest fullnodes on this network, you can always request a right state from them, validator just a part to stake and promise their state is right.
undefined says As far as I know, sequencer doesn't stake.
undefined says hey, had another question regarding the token bridge registrations for custom gateways
undefined says when im calling L1CustomGateway.registerTokenToL2 am i supposed to provide eth to the call
undefined says there is a line in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/test/TestCustomTokenL1.sol that is commented out which has msg.value set
undefined says Hi, you need send your submission fee and l2’s gas fee, get submission price by https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbretryabletx#getsubmissionpriceuint256-calldatasize-→-uint256-uint256-external
undefined says ah i see
undefined says Two malicious stakes could get into a challenge against each other, and then one of them will win that challenge, right? That is what is written here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol "Dispute resolution determines that one of the two disputant parties was incorrect, but we cannot infer that the other party was necessarily correct. Perhaps both parties made errors, or perhaps the two parties were colluding to "cook" the result of the dispute. " Of course, as long as one honest party stakes, the attacker will eventually get into a challenge against an honest party and lose, so the correct state will eventually finalize. 

I'm trying to understand how much it costs the attacker to delay finalization and to what degree that cost is prohibitive. Hypothetically, if someone with a large enough interest in a competing rollup platform could realistically burn enough money to delay finalization for a year, that seems like it would be a problem. As far as I can tell, the version of the attack I sketch above seems to get around the dependence on K in this claim from the above doc "If there are K people staking on the honest side, it will cost the attacker K stakes to buy one dispute period of delay." however, it forces the attacker to win L1 gas wars against other participants, so that may add back in resistance.
undefined says yeah exactly, a competing centralised L1 might just try (and have enough money) to do something like that
undefined says The sequencer only decides the ordering of transactions. It has no ability to censor, lie about who signed what, or make you do anything your tx doesn’t do
undefined says But you need a fraud proof to stop them doing that?
undefined says ArbOS will reject it, not validators
undefined says Sorry I don't remember where ArbOS runs?
undefined says ArbOS is the AVM program the nodes emulate and write fraud proofs for
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os
undefined says Thx. So since fraud hunting period is 7 days, it could take 6 days for fraud to be found right. And that means 6 days worth of txs reverted?
undefined says Nodes instantly know if fraud happened because their copy of ArbOS will produce a different result
undefined says So the 7 days is more like a buffer for arbitration to complete?
undefined says But that’s for fraud. For sequencing, fraud isn’t possible by the sequencer alone because it’s not a validator & ArbOS would reject invalid submissions
undefined says Yes, it’s a worst-case window
undefined says The reason is that we want to ensure ample time for the community to respond should something more serious happen (like a 51% attack on L1 ETH targeting Arbitrum)
undefined says Funny it's still called 51% attack when it's on PoS
undefined says It’s the percentage needed depending on the protocol used. Some cryptos have 67% attacks, others 33%, etc
undefined says I remember the sequencer  does  do `validateTx`,  so  a fraud tx with wrong signature will be rejected before adding to the batch ?
undefined says The sequencer could choose to use an invalid signature, it’ll just get the batch rejected in ArbOS & have no effect
undefined says The sequencer feeds inputs into ArbOS, whose execution validators attest
undefined says Yes, I see.  I used to have an idea to solve this issue, by  using TEE, like Intel SGX,  to run the Sequencer, and  use some efficient consensus algorithm, such as Raft, to achieve high availability.  This idea is built on the assumption that sequencer should work very fast and does not need any BFT-like consensus.
undefined says What I'm trying to say is that there isn't an issue here -- ArbOS won't let the sequencer do something like that
undefined says The sequencer's powers are quite limited. We of course want to decentralize it as we do all trusted things in this network, but its not able to do some of the things people have said it can
undefined says Yeah, I  know the sequencer's functionality.  The "issue" I mentioned is about  how sequencer  to provider the end users with the lower L 1  gas fee by batching transactions to inbox, and keep itself working with the high availability.  Can I ask more details about the design of the decentralized sequencer?  I heard you guys will release it soon.
undefined says https://blog.chain.link/arbitrum-and-chainlink-fair-sequencing-services/
undefined says After a quick look at this doc, https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-fair-sequencing-services-enabling-a-provably-fair-defi-ecosystem/,  " Oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering",  I still have no idea about what exact consensus algorithm the oracle  network use.  The doc discussed about the fairness algorithm, like BFT systems, auction or encrypted tx, and the Aequitas protocols, and finally tell us it's a framework.
undefined says scam
undefined says Hey guys. Anyone knows of a Brownie version of https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/arbitrum/index.html ?
undefined says Hi, what can I help you?
undefined says Wanted to understand how L1 calldata is charged. I just have a function call, calldata is 4 bytes (all non zero bytes). So calldata arbgas should be 4 * 16 = 64. But in practice the calldata cost is much higher, around 1600 arbgas. Is there any intrinsic calldata?
undefined says Hi, you can call this to get the arbgas unit of calldata: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L13
Address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says I'm more interested in how it is calculated? 
Using `getPricesInWeiWithAggregator` to get calldata unit and `getCurrentTxL1GasFees` which exactly matches with what we see on arbitrum's etherscan. Did some trials, with various input data lengths and it doesn't seem obvious to me how that works exactly.
for input data"0x", calldata arbgas == 1600
for input data"0x12", calldata arbgas == 1604
for input data"0x1212", calldata arbgas == 1620
for input data"0x121212", calldata arbgas == 1648
for input data"0x12121212", calldata arbgas == 1664 
following the cost 4 for zero byte and cost 16 for non zero byte. cost for '0x12' should be 1616 and for '0x1212' it should be 1632. It seems some bytes are varying in the 1600 component.
undefined says Hi, I'm not sure that my question belong to which group, I'm preparing bridge token on layer 1 to Arbitrum with "Default Standard Bridging", following the document point out to use this script to initiate bridge https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts#bridge-a-standard-token , question is there is the way to initiate token bridge with hardware wallet? (the script requires private key), or I miss something.
undefined says Hi, you’d better not use your assets address to deploy contract, you can use a new address to do that, it’s the same.
undefined says Ok I got it, thanks, so it doesn't matter what the caller address is right? I mean caller will not get any privilege on new contract, just for paying for the gas fee.
undefined says btw, as I looks into the code, If I try to call to bridge contract directly, only one function that I need to call as below right?
```js
const depositParams = {
  erc20L1Address: l1TokenAddress,
  amount: BigNumber.from(0),
}
await bridge.deposit(depositParams)
```
undefined says ref: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-ts/scripts/deployStandard.ts#L134
undefined says Hi, if you want to bridge a standard token, it’s ok.
undefined says Yes.
undefined says Great! thanks
undefined says The link above is a scam link, please don't click
@hunter | Offchain Labs
undefined says hey if a retryable ticket fails is there any way to check why its failing
undefined says im using the arb-ts bridge interface
undefined says Hi, you can run this to get retryable ticket dashboard: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/retryable-tx-panel
undefined says hey, another question - is there a deterministic way of finding calldata size for a retryable ticket when its not being directly created by your tx and another contract is making it
undefined says Currently we do not support use on chain’s interface to estimate a tx calldata’s size
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Any idea why the calldata arbgas is in this way? Particularly:
- Why calldata cost for empty input data '0x' is non-zero?
- If it has some initial value, i.e. lets assume it is 1600. Then why cost of one non-zero byte is not the initial value + 16 i.e. 1616?
If you can point me to any documentation that explains how calldata cost is calculated it'd be great
undefined says As an example, this is a simple ETH transfer, input data is empty. https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0x7e871708224fb432589dc07e0315fe4dcab8e4bea66358c6ac5d5ffde9588b70#txninfo
Still the L1 Calldata is about 28% of entire transaction cost (when the transaction does not have any calldata)
undefined says Not sure about this, will ask the team and give you feedback.
undefined says Two related questions. Any help much appreciated. (1) Is it possible for rollups to batch side chain transactions? (2) Is it possible for side chain transactions to contain rollup batches? I assume the answer to both of these is *yes* for time-insensitive transactions, but I'm guessing at least the latter will often screw up atomicity/consistency for many important transactions
undefined says Hi, for you first questions, In theory it can do, but side chain has it own consensus algorithm to keep the network honest, rollups is also the function, so there is no need to batch side chain transaction but just use rollups. For the second question, it is also yes, someone just forked arbitrum and deploy it on Xdai.
undefined says Hi all, I'm new to Arbitrum and am still learning blockchain theory. Let's say that a user owns an NFT on ethereum. Is there any way of verifying that NFT ownership on Arbitrum? Like if it was a video game and you owned an eth NFT to play but wanted to make transactions on Arbitrum for that game.
undefined says Hi, if so, you need use oracle to help you do that, because arbitrum and ethereum is different network although arbitrum is the layer2 of ethereum.
undefined says Hi Arbitrum team, would like to ask how does the Binance <> Arbitrum deposit work? Wouldn't depositing into Binance from Arbitrum L2 and subsequently withdraw to ETH L1 effectively skipping the 7 day fault proof process? Would love to learn about the mechanism and the catch behind this, thanks in advance
undefined says Hi, 7 days’ fraud proof window is just to make a tx finalized for the highest level, however there are several level for arbitrum network to finalize, which you can see here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality . Also for examples, bitcoin also needs 6 blocks’ confirmation to finalize a tx, but cex will show your funds on their exchange just in 1 blocks.
undefined says And arbitrum is also a blockchain network, they can leave the eth  which user deposit there and wait for the next time other user’s withdrawal.
undefined says Make sense, thanks for the link Jason! I will read👍🙌
undefined says hi there - quick question: as I develop L2 solidity contract on Arbitrum, is there any way for me to *read* the state, say by calling L1 public view function (rather than sending L1 message)?
undefined says (apology if it's not the right channel to ask - do direct me the right one if any)
undefined says Hi, you can just do this by using oracle, arbitrum and ethereum are 2 different network although arbitrum is built on ethereum.
undefined says understood
undefined says thank you @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is there a rough estimate when the Sequencer will be decentralized? Speaking in context to Geth's team position against EIP-4488 (reduce calldata costs) which argues "However, all existing rollup schemes are either insecure, or not fully trustless. Incentivizing people to use them might be too early because they don’t guarantee the same or similar security as L1." They mention Arbitrum at the end as well.
https://notes.ethereum.org/EH_xVCD8SnaLCEDrXxUyYA?view
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488
I know you probably don't have any timelines, but is it a question of 3 months, 6 months, a year or more than a year?
EDIT: Also, would you say that the inclusion of EIP-4488 would allow the Aribtrum team to focus on decentralizing the rollup instead of (afaik) current efforts of gas optimizations?
undefined says Hi guys, So we have a fully synced arbitrum rinkeby node up and running for a while. For some reason the docker container restarted and now the node seems stuck on: 

`Reloading chain starting with timestamp 1642715851
Seeding cache
Last L2 block saved to database: 8488266
`

It doen't seem to finish this process, anyone ever ran into this issue?
undefined says If you are running high speed NVMe, it'll load in about 15-20 minutes.  If you are running on SSD or hard disk, can take several hours
undefined says improvements are in the works, but no ETA
undefined says Im running on NVMe but its been like this for hours. Normally it would indeed go trough in about 20 minutes. No way to check the progress?
undefined says How much RAM do you have allotted to the docker container, and do you have plenty of drive space?
undefined says I'm guessing the docker container ran out of RAM, so it was killed without a chance of gracefully shutting down.  In that case, rocksdb is probably taking extra time to compact the database and recover everything.
undefined says NVMe drives are not all equal.  I use firecuda NVMe with 7,300MBps and 1,000,000 IOPS, starts in 10-15 minutes
undefined says Hi, can we implement custom logics on arbitrum?
undefined says Arbitrum does not have whitlelist now, everyone can deploy contract on it.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thanks, and also is erc 721 minting possible?
undefined says yes
undefined says I've got a question about how running my own node would interact with the sequencer
undefined says looking to get tx sent as quick as possible, there is a friend of mine who can always get 1 block in front of me.
undefined says please refer to: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#instant-confirmation
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, is there any update on this query?
undefined says thank for you the helpful link, when the docs says this line: 'Clients interact with the sequencer in exactly the same way they would interact with any full node, for example by giving their wallet software a network URL that happens to point to the sequencer.' -- does the main RPC point to the sequencer?
undefined says let me please confirm
undefined says I really appreciate the support, roo!
undefined says ok we confirm `the main RPC point to the sequencer`
undefined says https://discordapp.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/933812980175487036 any answer on this?
undefined says Hi, we are working on decentralized，and here is one of our related research: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/269.pdf , as for the timeline, we currently do not have one, because we always want to make everything done then put an announcement, we dislike delaying.
undefined says Can anyone help with this problem?
undefined says Is there a good way to convert arbgas to estimated L1 gas, given that I know the L1 gas price and all information about the transaction?
undefined says You can use your wallet to speed it up.
undefined says arbgas price is 1/100 of l1 gas price in most cases, but when l2 tx number increases, this will change.
undefined says Anyone have a way to check arbigas using hardhat tests?
undefined says Thanks for the reply. I'm looking for a way to adjust the L2 gas to L1. For example, a typical ether transfer on Arbitrum is around 420,000 arbgas. On Ethereum this would be fixed 21,000. How can I convert (or estimate) the 420,000 to 21,000?
undefined says Hi, this is depends on l1 calldata fee and l1 fixed fee, So the gas cost is floating, it’s hard to simply convert it.
undefined says What if I know the l1 calldata fee and l1 fixed fee at the time of transaction?
undefined says From my understanding, l1 gas used is 4 gas for zero bytes and 16 gas for other bytes in a serialized transaction?
undefined says I think you can just call eth_estimateGas to get a estimate gas, and then you can get the ether amount you need to pay, after this you can convert those ether number to the gas cost you want of l1.
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says i don't think hardhat supports AVM (Arbitrum virtual machine). Even if you do mainnet fork over arbitrum, it uses EVM only.
undefined says hey does someone know when I do an eth_call on a transaction, what timestamp will it use inside the contract function that I'm calling?
undefined says how are you using it, are you using Alchemy or Quicknode?
undefined says you can check QN: https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum/eth_call
undefined says https://moralis.io i use this for node
undefined says let me check something
undefined says thank you
undefined says would be nice to know asap
undefined says so if i add "pending"
undefined says it will use pending timestamps am i right?
undefined says in web3.py like this: web3.eth.call(tx, 'pending')
undefined says Block.timestamp on arbitrum is the around l1 block’s timestamp, which you can see here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Time_in_Arbitrum
undefined says I am getting "too many open files" error when syncing arbitrum (arb-node  process dies) , is the process calling to setrlimit() with RLIMIT_NOFILE parameter upon startup to setup unlimited filedescriptors?
undefined says when compiling from sources I am getting this error:

`arb-avm-cpp/data_storage/src/datastorage.cpp:43:13: error: ‘struct rocksdb::Options’ has no member named ‘allow_data_in_errors’
   43 |     options.allow_data_in_errors = true;
      |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`

checking the sources for RocksDB 6.11 , it doesn't have `allow_data_in_errors` member in the DBOptions struct. What version (of RocksDB) does Arbitrum use?
undefined says I ended up commenting this line of code (the line that was referring to `allow_data_in_errors` and it worked
undefined says how frequent are arbitrum blocks?
undefined says nvm i see the link
undefined says every ~30sec: https://arbiscan.io/blocks
undefined says tyvm
undefined says Arbitrum blocks are created whenever transactions are available, there is not set time between blocks
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says arb-node does not run as root, ulimit needs to be run as root to adjust file descriptor limit before starting arb-node
undefined says rocksdb version 6.20.3
undefined says Hi All, I'm currently investigating what it would take for our Centralised exchange to allow customers to have a on/off-ramp directly to the Arbitrum chain. We currently run our own geth nodes to verify transactions (incoming and outgoing) to credit or debit customers. 

I've read the documentation around setting up an Arb node, but not really sure that would be sufficient to prove that a Transaction pertaining to one of our customer addresses is final on-chain. 

I've also tried to follow a transaction from arbiscan to see how / where it is then finalized on the main ETH chain, but struggling to find that data transfer anywhere. 

A simple example of what I would need to see and verify before crediting a customer on the exchange is:
1) that there is a TX on arb chain that credits that address with x ETH
2) possibly run my own fraud proof on that TX to make sure that the tx is valid
3) wait for the tx to be "finalised" on layer 1 (this is the part im not able to verify manually at the moment)

any help or a point in the right direction would be appreciated
undefined says Hi, as for finalize, there are several degrees which you can see from this article: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality , as usual, you can regard it finalize once the sequencer confirms your tx. Also, sequencer will send tx batch to l1 which you can see here: https://arbiscan.io/batches. And you can also run your own fullnode to validate tx from l1 if you do not believe sequencer.
undefined says Hello, how much tx per block can arbitrum take at peak capacity?
undefined says Currently we handle about the same about of gas per second as Ethereum
undefined says Hi, guys. If i make a withdraw  transaction. Can i cancel it. Didn’t know it tooks 7 days.
undefined says Nope, it is irreversible. If you want to avoid 7-8 days withdraw, you can use 3rd-part bridge next time.
undefined says > arb-node does not run as root, ulimit needs to be run as root to adjust file descriptor limit before
not true, if the policy of the OS allows uprising limits a regular user can do it, I added this code snippet to `arb-node.go` so it can open unlimited amount of files:

`    var rLimit syscall.Rlimit
    rLimit.Max = 999999
    rLimit.Cur = 999999
    errlimit := syscall.Setrlimit(syscall.RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rLimit)
    if errlimit != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error setting rlimit: %v\n",errlimit)
        return
    }`
undefined says Hey @hunter | Offchain Labs , I saw on twitter that you recently deployed an upgrade that reduced the transaction fees. Was there a change of any parameters such as overhead? Or calldata costs? 

I'm trying to make a script that converts ArbGas to L1 gas. For example, an ether transfer is around 400,000 arbgas on arbitrum. I want to convert that number to L1 gas (so 21,000 gas in this case.) It doesn't have to be really accurate. The input data, rlp encoded transaction, l1 gas price and all other parameters of the transaction are known. Do you know if this is possible?

Thanks
undefined says Does Arbitrum's licensing allow us to run our own nodes, or is Offchain Labs the only ones allowed to execute `arbos.mexe`? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/issues/662
undefined says mainly by lowering L1 costs!

have you checked our docs on how fees are calculated?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#fees
undefined says Hi Everyone. I listened to an Arbitrum discussion today on Twitter and decided to look into the docs. I think I understand the distinction between optimistic rollups vs. validity proof rollups, but I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a product like Arbitrum and Polygon (apart from the proof strategy). These are both sidechains, right? This statement from the developer quickstart really puzzled me: "Next, you'll need to deploy an Arbitrum chain on an L1 blockchain" –– is the "chain" implemented as a contract, or as a sidechain network?
undefined says I guess the distinction is the aggregator. In the Polygon case, the RPC node is actually an entirely different sidechain. Whereas in Arbitrum, the node is simply an aggregator that writes to the L1 rollup contract (IIUC)
undefined says Hi, arbitrum is not side chain, it is a optimistic rollups. The chain means rollups chain.
undefined says What does "chain" mean here if it's a contract on L1
undefined says Ah I think I understand. The chain of state root transitions
undefined says Because arbitrum network also has state, and there are 2 chains on arbitrum one, first is sequencer chain, which is maintenance by sequencer used to give user a instant confirmation, for examples, once sequencer get a tx from a user, it will generate a new block as state update, and if sequencer get enough tx, it will batch them to l1. The second is rollups chain, which you can see here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-rollup-chain
undefined says Perfect. Thank you for explaining and sending this link over
undefined says Np
undefined says Maybe a different topic, but reading these docs it's a little unclear to me why optimistic rollups are more scalable than a sidechain with channel / plasma state checkpointing. Both require a network of nodes and both periodically write to L1. Seems like there may be a fundamental gap in my understanding?
undefined says For context I'm comparing / contrasting Arbitrum to Polygon
undefined says Hi, rollups need write calldata to l1, but plasma need not, which is rollups will be more safe than plasma
undefined says hey, I have a question. Is there an official snapshot for a node? A full sync takes a bit long atm
undefined says Hi, sorry for that, our snapshot is outdated, perhaps you need sync it by yourself.
undefined says i think it would be fine if it is outdated, as long as I don't need to sync from 0
undefined says Mainnet:
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says thanks !
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Thx!
undefined says By safety here do you mean less likely to have a potentially compromised centralized authority (e.g. Polygon itself) or do you mean that there's an inherent security risk in L2s that do not store calldata to L1
undefined says Because every l2‘s tx calldata will record on l1, so if l2 node runner cheat the state, others can read from l1’s inbox(used to record l2’s tx calldata) and compute them locally then get the latest correct state.
undefined says That makes sense but this only matters if you're using optimistic rollups, no? For example in Polygon the state is entirely replicated in the sidechain version of the EVM
undefined says Arbitrum uses optimistic rollups
undefined says right, but if another system doesn't use optimistic rollups, it's safety isn't predicated on having l2 tx calldata on l1
undefined says (more of a question than a statement)
undefined says If a blockchain network uses rollups, it’s safety will base on the layer1 network it uses, as for another system, just like side chain, it safety won’t rely on the mian chain.
undefined says Got it
undefined says Thank you again
undefined says Is it possible to read state from L1 contracts inside my contracts on arbitrum? Have read the docs but it still felt a little unclear
undefined says Hi, you can just use oracle to do this.
undefined says do you have any links/documentation/links on this?
undefined says You can search chainlink to see if they have this jobs. Although arbitrum is built on ethereum, they are 2 different network, also need use cross chain or oracle to do this.
undefined says Is it true that due to the data availability problem, the safety in a non-rollup sidechain is inherited strictly by trust in the operator, e.g. not anyone can run a Polygon node –– and in contrast because Arbitrum solves DA with optimistic rollups on L1 + fraud proofs, anyone can be an aggregator, meaning safety comes from the protocol itself and not trust in the operator?
undefined says Been trying to wrap my head around this
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Yes, user’s state is determined once their tx is recorded on l1, not by node operator, node operator just a part to provide a state not create a state like side chain. So the safety comes from l1 and the protocol itself.
undefined says Got it. And in the side chain setup, it's safe to say that we must trust the operator?
undefined says I think trust the network itself will be better, if node operator want to cheat, it needs pay some cost, not once the operator want to cheat then the network will be hacked, however, the side chain’s cost will be much lower than mainnet, so it safety is lower than mainnet.
undefined says hey, if a transaction has 2 retryable tickets, how do i use the arb-ts bridge to redeem both of them
undefined says is there any developer who can help with smartcontracts nft ?
undefined says please check: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says https://notes.ethereum.org/EH_xVCD8SnaLCEDrXxUyYA?view
undefined says Has there been any discussions on this?
undefined says Is there any comparisons between doing an SSTORE on Ethereum vs a storage update on Arbitrum?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#price-for-storage
undefined says I have noticed that tx.l1TransactionPrice / tx.l2ComputationPrice is always equal to 460,000. What does this number represent, is it a special parameter?
undefined says L1TxPrice / l1CalldataPrice = 4000
undefined says L!TransactionoPrice / L2StoragePrice always 2.3
undefined says Can't find anything related in the Arbitrum docs
undefined says "However, all existing rollup schemes are either insecure, or not
fully trustless" from https://notes.ethereum.org/EH_xVCD8SnaLCEDrXxUyYA?view
undefined says is this true? I thought zk sync was both
undefined says question @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs is (and if so why) censorship at the sequencer a different problem than the data availability problem that rollups are meant to solve?
undefined says 
undefined says From Vitalik: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/sgd3zt/a_quick_reminder_of_what_shared_security_means/
undefined says thx!
undefined says this statement on rollups still seems confusing to me. executing the fraud proofs requires data availability and if the rollup sequencer is byzantine for some reason how is it guaranteed that txns are ever making it to the rollup contract
undefined says only thing I can think of is that the rollup compatible wallet is verifying transaction settlements on L1
undefined says also these transaction delays can lead to loss in highly adversarial environments right?
undefined says I am wondering what the best way to run hardhat tests against the avm and not just the evm is. I am trying to have github actions run my contract code on arbitrum against the avm.
undefined says Hey on Arbitrum, what triggers the "invalid transaction nonce" (code -32000) error other than an actual invalid nonce? I know my nonce is fine but I occasionally get that error anyways. I think my gas price is fine, but could be wrong. Does this happen when the gas "speed limit" is reached during congestion?

Sometimes I get that error but the transaction also goes through, but not every time.
undefined says There is a dev-node that behaves similarly to ganache you can use for testing
We don't have documentation or a docker image published with it yet but you can run it as follows:

```
cd arbitrum
yarn install
yarn install:validator
cd packages/arb-rpc-node/cmd/arb-dev-node
go run arb-dev-node.go
```

worth noting that we're not officially supporting this yet, will be live on the docs with easier setup soon
undefined says hm are you using `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc` or a rpc provider like alchemy/infura?
undefined says The sequencer can’t censor because delayed inbox exists, and Arbitrum is a state function of the messages in its L1 inbox, so ETH makes the data available
undefined says @fred I am using https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc as my RPC when this happens
undefined says That can sometimes happen if you submit multiple transactions with the same nonce rapidly in a row.  This issue is on our roadmap to be fixed soonish.
undefined says Hmm, unless web3.py resubmits rapidly under the hood, this is happening even when only submitting once.
I am using send_raw_transaction to send signed transactions directly to https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
I can provide more details if there is anything specific that would help if it isn't a known issue
undefined says It will most likely be fixed in a couple weeks
undefined says In the meantime I'd recommend giving the alchemy RPC a try
https://www.alchemy.com/layer2/arbitrum
undefined says @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs thx! is there a doc on delayed inbox?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says does anyone has the roadmap of arbitrum?
undefined says Currently we are working on the nitro upgrade, we will announce others upgrade when we are ready.
undefined says Ser I thought it was discord nitro for a moment, then I remember arbitrum nitro :facepalmdpx:
undefined says haha
undefined says Will the sequencer change due to nitro?
undefined says Is there an easy way to see which L1 Sequencer Batch your L2 transaction was included in?
undefined says Is there any data around how many challenges have been made and of those how many are successful?
undefined says Sure, the vm will change, so sequencer needs some upgrade
undefined says Would appreciate if there is any information available.
undefined says Got it, sorry for late reply, will forward to you once I got the answers.
undefined says we are working with arbiscan to have this displayed there.
If you are running a node, you can use returnL1InboxBatchInfo from https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/releases/tag/v1.0.0

We are also working on a typescript library to help with that
undefined says Hi, you can check this challenge contract here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ad1dc4ab5475d9f8cd10118c9d28b06f0c8a2d9 , but now, there have not a challenge yet.
undefined says Okay thank you.
undefined says Awesome, thank you. I was wondering is there an arbiscan api call to get "Advance TxInfo". (breakdown of L1 and L2 costs) ty 🙂
undefined says Of course, you can just use eth_getTransactionReceipt to get that, it has feeStats.
undefined says Hey - are there any good resources to learn about the security differences of L1 -> L2 bridges such as arbitrum vs. L1 -> L1 bridges?  In the light of the wormhole indicent want to understand if there is any security difference because of being an L2 or if attack surface is still equally dependent on smart contract risk
undefined says L1 <-> L2 is safer because a true L2 like Arbitrum is a state function of the messages in its L1 inbox. In an L1 <-> L1’ system, additional coordination is needed between two chains since they make progress independently.
undefined says If someone were to try to exploit the Arbitrum bridge contract on Ethereum, would anything on the Arbitrum network prevent that from happening?
undefined says There’s still smart contract risk, but the kinds of contracts for L1 <-> L2 are easier to reason about as they can securely assume coordination. So sure, both have smart contracts, but not all smart contracts are the same
undefined says The L1 contracts must be correct, but like I’m saying the tools available to an L2 make writing and auditing secure bridging code easier
undefined says Hi guys wassup, I'm trying to get the infos on the available liquidity for both tokens in a Uni v3 pool on Arbitrum, anyone can point me to docs on how to do that ? 
I'm just looking for the tokens quantities, not the $ value.
The contract doesn't have any function to retrieve that ( I think ), and TheGraph doesn't seem to index Arbitrum yet.
Many thanks :peepolove:
undefined says I also asked in Uni discord but it's pretty calm there 😄
undefined says Makes sense. The less complex something is, the easier it is to secure
undefined says Exactly. The problem wormhole is trying to solve is very hard, but thankfully when it comes to bridging the L2 model relaxes a lot of requirements
undefined says https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ianlapham/uniswap-arbitrum-one
undefined says I must've missed that :peepofacepalm: thank you so much
undefined says Hi, when sending a message from a L1 contract to a L2 contract: Will `msg.sender` of the L2 transaction be the L1 contract address?

I read that this is not the case with "retryable tickets" (in this case; `msg.sender` on L2 = `L2 Alias`) .
But would it work with "EthBridge"?
undefined says At the moment there is no fee charged for ArbGas but is there any way to estimate the USD or ETH value of it? since there is a "L2 Computational Paid:" in arbiscan
undefined says thanks Rachel this is helpful. I thought this was the case but then felt like I couldn't really articulate why well enough
undefined says Hi, in the case `msg.sender` on l2 is your l1 contract address’ aliasing, you can read this article: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing
undefined says Hi, arbgas is charged now, you can get the price by call eth_gasPrice
undefined says oh great 🙂 Is the doc out of date (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas) or am I misunderstanding what "the fee is set to zero by default in Arbitrum beta" means
undefined says Hi, this means the part which pay to validators is free now.Currently, arbgas include l1 calldata fee, l1 fixed fee, l2 computational fee and l2 storage fee.
undefined says Wen nitro
undefined says We  do not have a timeline, but will announce when we are ready
undefined says This is a scam link, please don't click @hunter | Offchain Labs
undefined says Why does the difference in New Msg Count between batches not match the batch size? e.g Batch Size = 211 but message count of batch minus it's previous is 418 (is MessageCount != Batch Transaction Count and batches include more data?) ty
undefined says Looks like batches can sometimes contain more than 1 message
undefined says 
undefined says is this saying that a transaction can take up multiple messages??
undefined says 
undefined says On arbiscan is there an api call where you can get these individual costs?
undefined says Hello! Does the Arb Rinkeby network support immediate redemption on retryable tickets?
undefined says Long story short, I'm working on a custom contract similar to the Greeter example (using `createRetryableTicket`). I'm fairly convinced that gas and transactions are setup properly, but I can't seem to get the auto redemption to trigger. Redeeming manually with the "retryable-tx-panel" app runs the transaction as expected.
undefined says Perhaps not, I didn’t find this on their docs.
undefined says You can use the “retryable-tx-panel” to see why your auto redeem fails.
undefined says Yes sir! "retryable-tx-panel" works great.

It gives the transaction status: `auto redeem TxResultCode_noGasForAutoRedeem; you can redeem it now`

... but this is why I was wondering if the Arb Rinkeby network was auto redeeming transactions.

I'm sending maxGas>0, gasPriceBid>0, and ether with the transaction, and both my Rinkeby and Arb Rinkeby wallets have balance.
undefined says (just trying to rule out if there's a problem in my scripts/contracts, or on the Arb Rinkeby network)
undefined says Can you create a ticket with your tx hash and some other useful information here? https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/requests/new
undefined says will do, thanks!
undefined says those messages are not only the tx sent from users, but also some rollups things on this network.
undefined says what do the other messages include? ty
undefined says Some system hearbeat msg etc.
undefined says hey guys just a question: I'm streaming pending txns on arbitrum, printing blocknumbers and hashes. Why are those gaps there between blocks?
undefined says like some txns dont appear
undefined says my provider doesnt receive those txns?
undefined says have you tried comparing to the block explorer
undefined says is it tesnet or mainet, and how exactly you are streaming it
undefined says seems like it gets null as response to web3.getTransaction(txHash) for those missing blocks
undefined says so it gets all the hashes but the ones missing are missing because it could not get the tx for them for some reason
undefined says I'm trying different nodes maybe or keep requesting until it gets not null
undefined says because the tx hashes are coorect and txs are confirmed when I check
undefined says hmm strange, is this web3 request per certain account? sounds good let us know how it goes
undefined says hm look now
undefined says 
undefined says I use quicknode for subscribing to pending
undefined says then requesting the received txhashes with a http infura node
undefined says and now no missing
undefined says 
undefined says web3 is websocket, web31 is a https endpoint
undefined says and it seems to get the job done now
undefined says 
undefined says by the way how resource heavy is it to run arbitrum node?
undefined says I'm checking out the guide right now and thought to install it on the same server as my eth node
undefined says hopefully it will be able to manage both
undefined says I ran into this problem trying to install it on two separate machines
undefined says could someone offer some help?
undefined says For AWS, r5d.2xlarge. In addition you need have at least 120GB storage to run it.
undefined says well I've decided to run it on the same server as my eth node
undefined says but I just can't seems to be able to install it
undefined says trying to install new libraries but errors keep popping up
undefined says 
undefined says this is the latest error...
undefined says alright I managed to run it, but seems like my localhost:8545 is refusing the connection to the docker
undefined says 
undefined says Hi, can you check your firewall?
undefined says when I changed localhost to 127.0.0.1:8545
undefined says it started working
undefined says Hey is there gas price API we can use for finding the most accurate gas price needed to submit transactions?
undefined says Does pinging the https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol #getPricesInWei()[0] return the appropriate data?
undefined says Or I guess #getPricesInArbGas()[0]?
undefined says Still curious how I can get these breakdowns by looking on-chain or via an API call. ty 🙂
undefined says have you tried: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/940717358056615997
undefined says calling an rpc method to get gwei
undefined says I haven't tried it but I was under the impression it didn't send the most updated/correct arb gas price?
undefined says it should maybe try: https://rpc.ankr.com/arbitrum
undefined says https://cointool.app/rpcServer/arb
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c6f947ae67f572afa4ae0730947de7c874f95ef

Can I take a TXHash of one of the batches in the sequencer inbox and get all the transaction associated with it on L2?
undefined says dont think oyu need to worry about gas price
undefined says just set more than 10 and you will probably never have problems
undefined says it only takes as much as needed
undefined says not sure how this bid system works but its not like priority fee which can be taken entirely if you set too much
undefined says i closed my arbitrum docker process and it started all over again from 0?
undefined says Hi, we do not have this api, but we are working on this, in the future we will have this function’s api.
undefined says You mean sync block?
undefined says Yeah
undefined says Hi, maybe you didn’t set your docket to use persistent volume, please check this.
undefined says yeah that was it probably
undefined says I changed to native install since
undefined says should be faster
undefined says hello! is the L2 -> L1 message dispute window a full 7 days on the Arb Rinkeby network?
undefined says any ideas about how to fix this error? Its on a debian machine
undefined says you are using an old version of gcc, upgrade to the latest
undefined says 
undefined says how can I do so on this debian machine? It says its latest
undefined says im seeing results where they say its not possible to upgrade on buster
undefined says so i guess I can only do it via docker
undefined says can you help me how can I make the mounted folder persistent?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node has the instructions
undefined says The Docker image is configured to run as non-root UID 1000. This means if you are running in Linux and you are getting permission errors when trying to run the docker image, run this command to allow all users to update the persistent folders
```
mkdir /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet
chmod -fR 777 /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet```
undefined says ah alright sorry
undefined says I thought i had done it
undefined says but let me see
undefined says well when I close the docker and restart it seems to start all over anyway
undefined says even though I did the permissions
undefined says I did it according to the guide
undefined says I just give the permissions and start it with the command in the guide
undefined says am i missing something?
undefined says try running this:
```docker run --rm -it  -v /tmp:/mnt debian```
undefined says from inside the docker image, look in `/mnt` and you should see everything from your `/tmp` directory on your host machine.  You can play around until you get the mounting working
undefined says what can I play around with?
undefined says so the mounting is when I specify a dir before the ":" and i already have given access to that folder
undefined says so it should persist
undefined says make sure you can create files, etc.
undefined says if you are confident it is setup properly, start the arbitrum node following the instructions, and see if anything is created in the directory you mounted.  If nothing is created, something is wrong with the permissions or mounting
undefined says so what else do I have to do besides adding permissions?
undefined says and specifying the folder in the running command
undefined says You'll have to figure that out yourself.  Practice with the plain debian container to make sure you can write files from inside the docker container such that they appear on your host system
undefined says well i found finally a solution without container
undefined says https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61590804/how-to-install-gcc-9-on-debianlatest-docker
undefined says this solves if for anyone trying to do it from a debian buster
undefined says Hi, it’s much more short, only about 1 days.
undefined says Hi, is there a way to send Arbitrum transactions directly to a contract (i.e. similar to etherscan's "contract" functionality) ? Arbiscan doesn't seem to support it yet
undefined says actually, ignore me. it's just that the contract i'm trying to interact with seems to be unverified
undefined says are there any plans to make the syncing process faster?
undefined says it takes like 2-3 days now with a pretty good machine
undefined says syncing up to 5M blocks
undefined says Dear Arbitrum Team & All,

I am collecting these data for a study comparing performances of EVM compatible blockchains.
I have a few questions regarding the Arbitrum blockchain properties in terms of scalability, decentralization, and security.

Could you please provide me with some answers on the below questions:
1.    Scalability: How many transactions per second (TPS) can Arbitrum process?
2.    Decentralization: How many nodes (validators) is there for the Arbitrum blockchain network?
3.    Security: As I can’t find any other metric to measure security; What is the cost to attack the Arbitrum blockchain?

Thank you in advance.
undefined says Hi,
1. The tps of arbitrum depends on ethereum because every tx on l2 its tx calldata will record on l1.
2. Arbitrum is rollups protocol so it is a 1/n model which means only if there is a honest validator on this work and even though others validator are cheater, this network can still be safe.
3. As for the security, the security of l2 is based on l1, because every tx calldata needs to be recorded on l2, and the state is decided once the tx calldata recorded, this is because every honest node can read from l1, and compute those tx calldata and get the correct state.
undefined says Thanks for your answer, much appreciated. See below some comments:
1. Does it mean that the Arbitrum processed TPS is around 14 TPS like Ethereum? That seems very low. I thought Arbitrum had about 40k TPS
2. Thanks for your comment. Do you know where I can find the number of validators on Arbitrum?
3. I believe this means Arbitrum is as secure as Ethereum? i.e. the cost of attacking Arbitrum is about the same as attacking Ethereum?
undefined says Hi, 
1. Nope, the tps on l1 is 14 is because ethereum will execute those tx, however, for rollups, only need record tx calldata on l1 and execute it off chain, this will huge increase tps.
2. Currently offchainlabs run the validators but we will open it later.
3. Arbitrum’s security is very close to ethereum( because hackers might hack our sequencers, but due to users can still send tx via l1 directly so it’s not so serious) and is much higher than side chain or plasma scales method.
undefined says Been diving deep into the security issues of the Verifiers Dilemma… it’s still very much over my head but the concept hits home … how is the optimistic roll up landscape changing in order to maintain the incentive to verify
undefined says Also using “security issues” lightly as its mere theoretical in nature
undefined says Hi, I will share you those two articles: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html
https://www.mechanism.capital/rollups-introduction/
undefined says ty ty my friend
undefined says Only one honest validator is needed for an optimistic rollup to succeed, so an incentive argument has a bar about as low as it can get — only 1 actor needs to be incentivized to enforce correctness
undefined says See, this is how I interpreted it as well. But I am enamored still the amount of articles I found talking about this “verifiers dilemma” … it seemed so much simpler than the logistics they were using on a non-issue …
undefined says How much lower can the bar get 🤣
undefined says The verifier’s dilemma would be more persuasive if, say, 2/3rds were needed for correctness. A common misconception about optimistic L2’s is that the validators play the same role as those you see in alt L1’s. L2 validators need only provide the input to the contracts on L1, which are secured by Ethereum’s miners
undefined says I suppose if one designed a system that didn’t need validation at all, but such a system wouldn’t be able to do much haha
undefined says Thank you for your responses, I appreciate them a lot. I have been looking into building on Arbitrium. I love the ability to speak to the team.
undefined says Thanks for the interesting discussion, it’s always fun
undefined says :sayori: :SCALEIT:
undefined says Hey  guys! Hopefully this is the  place to  clear some questions I have about  gas fee (arbGas) in Arbitrum ecosystem:
1. Since this is EVM compatible - will estimateGas() from ethersJs will still work? I am guessing it will give me gas needed, but not quite arbGas - is there an easy way to translate between the two?(reference: https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-estimateGas)
2.  Will .getFeeData() of Ethere JS will work ? I understand that Arbitrum uses EIP-1559 style auctions , but the validator gas right now is set to 0, so maxFeePerGas is what we will be looking for, maxPriorityFeePerGas will be 0,  (refernce: https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-getFeeData)
undefined says Hey guys
undefined says trying to understand how to get the actual gas price that a transaction used from the transaction object
undefined says 
undefined says This property
undefined says when I use web3.getTransaction or from web3.getTransactionReceipt is the gasPrice which is 1 GWEI, but how do I find the real gas price paid?
undefined says This is the transaction object for example, can't seem to find this info
undefined says Hi, 
1. Of course, all the eth json-rpc support on arbitrum. If you want to get arbgas by call signer.getGasPrice() with ethersjs or call eth_gasPrice directly using json-rpc.
2. Not sure how will ethersjs process this, but You can just call `signers.getGasPrice()` .
undefined says Hi, if you call eth_getTransactionReceipt, you will get it from feeStats.prices, there are 4 area mapping to different part.
undefined says so my node was syncing nicely up until some point
undefined says and now im getting this error
undefined says 
undefined says am i screwed an gonna have to restart it?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Where can I find this number?
undefined says ohhh I think I found it
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/win-confetti-celebration-gif-7374480
undefined says Arbitrum does not have a world state tree, only avm state, so how does it keep accounts?
undefined says the current version relies on arb-os for storing this state, so its actually laid out a bit differently. it is still merkle trees but the way you store and traverse them is different.
with nitro we will be using geth and this storage layout
undefined says it means that Arbitrum has the same storage layout as ethereum?
undefined says for nitro
undefined says Yes, by using geth.
undefined says nitro will implement EVM equivalence?
undefined says Will nitro still maintain Interactive Proving?
undefined says Yes, We are now also evm compatible.
undefined says When will the team issue the token
undefined says Is the number of messages contained in a block limited by the total amount of block gas and block generation period? What is the general number of messages contained in a block now?
undefined says The above "block" refer to "rollup block"
undefined says Does the rollup block specify a minimum number of messages to contain?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says If you mean rollup block, you can see it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/Node.sol , every time validator make an assertion, it will create a new node like this.
undefined says Hey everyone, where can I find the cause of this error: `MinArbGasForContractTx`? Can't find it in the github repo
undefined says I get this when using `eth_estimateGas` on a contract call
undefined says Hello, The doc mentions about the `Tradeable bridge exits` in this section(https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/withdrawals#tradeable-bridge-exits)   but I couldn't find the associated contracts. I also find `L1SignedLiquidityProvider` mentioned in the doc but couldn't find the contracts https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/99311fee186ab1ea164063870821b151b7ad4d4d/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/tokenbridge/misc/L1SignedLiquidityProvider.md
When could we expect these contracts to be available?
undefined says Maybe this will help you https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts#bridge-a-standard-token
undefined says Hi, you mean you get this error when calling `eth_estimateGas` or use the feedback value as gas to call the contract and get this error?
undefined says Hi, this is used by 3rd part bridge who provide the liquidity fast withdraw.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I understand that this is used for 3rd party bridge for providing fast withdraw but the github is missing the solidity file while the documentation mentions about the same. 
Should the implementation be done by the third party or is there an existing implementation that could be used?
undefined says Not sure if others use this solution,  but we will have a tutorial about this later.
undefined says any ideas?
this is the error im getting: "error":"error opening monitor: failed to initialize storage with mexe '/root/.arbitrum/mainnet.arb1.mexe', possibly corrupt database or incorrect L1 node?"
undefined says after syncing for 2 days
undefined says it just stops
undefined says this is the second time and i can do nothing about it
undefined says any idea on when the tutorial would be published? I was planning on using it for the fast withdraw with a liquidity pool
undefined says Sure, will be published.
undefined says Can you restart it correctly?
undefined says i try to run it again and gives me the same error
undefined says i guess i can delete the latest entry in the db?
undefined says is there a way somehow I can go back?
undefined says I realized its the manifests its using to know where it is
undefined says and the latest seems corrupt
undefined says last working one is 021452.sst and the manifest is pointing to 021453
undefined says or is there somewhere where i can download all these db entries
undefined says so i dont have to sync
undefined says You're running locally? @bigboybilly
undefined says I had to increase open file limit for native node. That was the only issue I ran into. I have mine running on ubuntu, the error was more specified. The mainnet.arb1.mexe was the one that gave me problems too until I increased the open file limit.
undefined says if you go into `CURRENT` it will show you the manifest it is pointing to.
undefined says yes i went into current
undefined says and yes I'm trying to run it locally
undefined says what command did you run that fixed it?
undefined says https://tecadmin.net/increase-open-files-limit-ubuntu/
undefined says i think mine is actually doomed now
undefined says i cant point it back to 1 before
undefined says I didn't have to restart my db
undefined says since there are no older manifests
undefined says and current manifest doesnt seem to work
undefined says I'm running another sync on another machine and there I got the too many open files error
undefined says but tried some commands and still cant start
undefined says https://docs.revenera.com/fnci6132/Content/helplibrary/Setting_the_Open_File_Limit__Linux_Unix_.html
undefined says oh nice the ulimit -n fixed it for the other machine
undefined says but im not sure what i can do with the other where it says it's "corrupt"
undefined says latest is 021452 and manifest is 021453
undefined says if i set it to 52 in the CURRENT the manifest will say it doesnt exist
undefined says `failed to initialize storage` is usually a permissions issue
undefined says or at worst a drive issue
undefined says hmm actually it might be fine now
undefined says lol
undefined says by setting ulimit there as well
undefined says i thought it had bigger problems
undefined says since the error wasnt directly the "too many open files"
undefined says good 🙂 I'm glad it worked
undefined says yeah me too
undefined says thanks a lot
undefined says saved me from mental breakdown
undefined says definitely 👍
undefined says i feel like it would take less time to just download the whole db
undefined says not sure if that is a workable solution
undefined says i just see it can start from any checkpoint
undefined says so why not have the whole 100 GB somewhere like a snapshot
undefined says it takes 4-5 days on machine which has pretty nice hardware and also syncing on local eth node
undefined says Yeah it took me a bit. About 3 days not counting the geth node.
undefined says im just gonna save the whole folder for myself if it manages to sync
undefined says download 100Gb takes a few hours only
undefined says what is the current size when fully synced?
undefined says That's exactly what I did. Saved it to a drive
undefined says yeah honestly its just stupid right now
undefined says the db folder is 75.4 gigs currently
undefined says if someone just put it somewhere available for download
undefined says oh nice then im close
undefined says at 57Gb
undefined says ill be done tomorrow
undefined says @Big Ben (will Never DM you) on your node is the pending transactions subscription working?
undefined says i saw some public arb nodes where it was diabled
undefined says I don't see pending no
undefined says I can see errors
undefined says how can you monitor new txs then?
undefined says I think I am misunderstanding your question. I can see all the txs that are sent or reverted.
undefined says I will be setting one up for testnet soon. I've been spending more time studying solidity once I had this running last week tbh
undefined says ahh i see
undefined says well ill see tomorrow anyway
undefined says Anyone know how these L1, L2 values are calculated?
undefined says Is there a good way to estimate gas on arbitrum? for how much storage of lets say text the length of a tweet would be
undefined says ArbOS: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbos_formats#logs
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs
undefined says Oh I see! How can I get access to those log data values? Ty
undefined says Where it says "Logs"
undefined says I tried grabbing the tx_receipt of transaction (0xf224bba102dcada7d9a6665e955dff3f4003411248e00cfaa988383ee7593137) using infura arbitrum node but I can't see the "fee information for the transaction, a 4-tuple consisting of" to get the breakdown of L1/L2 costs.
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/942054635735220244
undefined says nice thanks
undefined says I am running a local node and I am wondering how transactions are submitted to the blockchain. It seems that they are always sent to the public rpc node rather than to the p2p layer. Is there even a p2p layer? I can't seem to find any config related to this (like max number of peers, etc). 

I think this is the relevant config

      --node.forwarder.submitter-address string                        address of the node that will submit your transaction to the chain
      --node.forwarder.target string                                   url of another node to send transactions through

        "forwarder": {
            "rpc-mode": "full",
            "submitter-address": "",
            "target": "https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"
        }

I am a bit surprised by this. Do all nodes submit transactions to a single server? 😮
undefined says When running netstat I do not see any p2p connections related to Arbitrum. I don't even know what port is used for this. For Ethereum L1 I see a lot of geth connections on 30303 (as expected).
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance It is all still centralized unless you have been whitelisted to test a validator. In beta aka running with training wheels.
undefined says > Execution is deterministic -- which means that the chain’s behavior is uniquely determined by the contents of its inbox. Because of this, the result of your transaction is knowable as soon as your transaction has been put in the inbox. Any Arbitrum node will be able to tell you the result. (And you can run an Arbitrum node yourself if you want.)
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says Have you figure out what the Block size limit / target is?
If it's dynamically calculate then how is it calculate?
undefined says Thanks for the info. At this moment I can clearly see that some of my transactions are being censored. In certain situations they never make it to the chain (not even a fail). Are there more sequencers I can include to avoid this? Is there something I can change in the config?

When will Arbitrum be decentralized?
undefined says On the "final" release once they take the beta label off. I don't have a time frame or any insider info other than soon. I just spend most of my free time learning as much about Arbitrum as I can and helping in any way. I believe in Ed and the amazing team he has put together :arbheart:
undefined says I've been into ETH for many years this scaling solution makes the most sense. There's a lot of good info in #📺︱youtube
undefined says https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/ethereum-layer-2-rollup-debate-optimism-starkware-arbitrum-and-zksync/ This is amazing as well
undefined says Hi, I noticed that almost all of the blocks contain only 1 transaction. And occasionally when a block contains more than 1, the transactions are not ordered by gas price.
Is this intended behavior?
undefined says If so, where can I read more about it? Thank you.
undefined says Hi, currently the tx is ordered by first come first serve
undefined says Will it increase the number of transactions in a block if demand goes up?
undefined says Yes
undefined says If it's first come first serve, what's the purpose of the gas price?
undefined says If uncomfirmed tx number is heavy, it will depends on gas price the users pay.
undefined says Thank you.
undefined says Wondering if any one knows a good  API to extract token holder information on Arbitrum
undefined says you mean just addresses etc ?
undefined says you could use this https://arbiscan.io/apis#accounts
undefined says I can't get the ABI or access the contract to sushiswap LP tokens on arbitrum
undefined says many of the contracts are not present, I know I'm missing something but I don't know what it is
undefined says it is simply that the contracts are not published and you can't get the ABI ?
undefined says or is there a workaround ?
undefined says If you know the command parameters, you can use an ABI from an identical v2 LP contract or just create an ABI for the commands you need
undefined says if you don't know the function parameters, then there is not much you can do w/ an unpublished contract
undefined says understood, thanks
undefined says do you know why on the arbitrum sushiswap contract I can manually fetch the getpair method of an LP pair but on my code I get 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 even tho I'm fetching the factory contract ABI correctly ? 
note that this program is made to run on many chains, and arbitrum is the only one that doesn't get me the pair address it's weird
undefined says even a little hint would help
undefined says I know I'm doing something wrong here but I don't know what 😄
undefined says is this on the v2 factory contract?
undefined says it's this V2 : https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc35dadb65012ec5796536bd9864ed8773abc74c4#code
undefined says this is a dumb quesion but are farm pairs registered  in the factory ?
undefined says I'm assuming I'm checking farm pairs, because I see no pools on sushiswap in arbitrum ... it's just blank
undefined says so I'm guiding myself by farm pairs
undefined says hopefully this helps you, the sushiswap v2 address is 0xc35DADB65012eC5796536bD9864eD8773aBc74C4 on arbitrum
undefined says looks published 👍
undefined says I see you are a fellow dopex nft holder?
undefined says yeah 🙂 sup bro
undefined says was at Dopex and now at Jones as well
undefined says so yes this is the contract I have been using .. it's weird. I will just keep debugging until I find out why
undefined says I'm getting a local arbitrum node and doing some work
undefined says Hi, the rpc node you called is your node or other rpc?
undefined says It's my own node and i just found out why this was happening .... It's simply that i am still indexing and it's on 2021 now. So obviously I needed to look for a pair that was there since the start. As soon as I tried with weth / usdc it worked ... Sorry for the inconvenience but it's late here
undefined says Thanks the halp
undefined says Glad to hear this！
undefined says Does submitting a Disputable Assertion generate a new rollup block ?
undefined says Nope, here is the code: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1e13bb8cf5f44c4c7fc585797336eaae3935113c#code , it should use 2 existing node(which is rollups block).
undefined says it mean that the dispute will create two nodes, and then the rollup block will contain both nodes?
undefined says Nope, if 2 nodes have the same father node, which is they have different state claimed, so someone can have a DA of those 2 nodes.
undefined says One thing I'm curious about is why is the arbgas used in a block different from the aggregate arbgas used of the transaction in that block. 

(e.g https://arbiscan.io/block/6238408 block 6238408 used 331k arbgas but the tx in it used 944k arbgas)
undefined says The gas in block information only contain l2 gas cost, but the gas on tx page contain both l1 and l2 cost.
undefined says So the complete process is that any verifier can create a new rollup block(A). If other verifiers think the rollup block(A) is wrong, they can create the rollup block(B) they think is correct, and challenge the rollup block(A) through DA.
undefined says Yes
undefined says Is Arbitrum's power to generate new blocks controlled by Sequencer when the Sequencer module is turned on?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs do you know if there is a way to get an IPC socket on a node ?
undefined says I need to get the max possible speed indexing and trying to adjust things now
undefined says nvm, just tested the websocket and it's not a matter of this, but more about the time that takes to read a block locally
undefined says guess the only way read blocks fast is parallel reads
undefined says Hi @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, it was suggested that I check in with you about this issue I'm running into with the bridge: 

https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/765654444825641001/943205058642853919
undefined says Hi, currently we run our own sequencer, but in the future, we will have decentralized sequencer.
undefined says Hi, what greeting contract did you use? Because I saw the byte code is different from our tutorials’.
undefined says Can you share with me your code? You can open a ticket and attach your code, then please give me the ticket number.
undefined says Yes, that would be helpful, thanks!
undefined says Does anyone know how to use etherscan-api npm module with arbiscan?
undefined says Looks like it's not supported based on the docs, so maybe it needs a patch?
```
// apikey, network, timeout
var api = require('etherscan-api').init('YourApiKey','rinkeby'. '3000');
```
undefined says you can configure different ethereum testnets, like ropsten, rinkeby, etc, but I don't see a way to use a different but compatible service, like arbiscan.
undefined says Did you use the api key from arbiscan?
undefined says no, with etherscan I used the etherscan api key. But I'd like to search arbiscan. I got it to work by forking the etherscan-api npm module and adding arbiscan to the testnet options, like this:
```
diff --git a/lib/get-request.js b/lib/get-request.js
index c81c37b..c72fbf6 100644
--- a/lib/get-request.js
+++ b/lib/get-request.js
@@ -18,6 +18,8 @@ const TESTNET_API_URL_MAP = {
   ropsten: 'https://api-ropsten.etherscan.io',
   kovan: 'https://api-kovan.etherscan.io',
   rinkeby: 'https://api-rinkeby.etherscan.io',
+  arbitrum: 'https://api.arbiscan.io',
+  arbitrumTestnet: 'https://api-testnet.arbiscan.io',
   homestead: 'https://api.etherscan.io'
 };
```
then you can call it like
```
// apikey, network, timeout
var api = require('etherscan-api').init(ARBISCAN_API_KEY,'arbiscanTestnet'. '3000');
```
undefined says arbiscan has it own key, if you want to search arbiscan, I recommend you to register one arbiscan account and use that key.
undefined says I understand that, thanks. That wasn't the issue. I'm talking about using the etherscan-api npm module instead of doing normal http api requests to etherscan, and it doesn't work with arbitrum unless you make the changes above.
undefined says Got it, I will let etherscan team know this, thanks!
undefined says Sounds good. The etherscan-api npm package is useful because it decodes logs for you. It would be useful to developers for arbitrum to support a branch of this module or else get a change like this one accepted to the main etherscan-api package.
undefined says Hi Jason, here is my ticket ID: 789264
undefined says There are enough moving pieces where it probably just makes sense to give you repo read access, so please let me know which github account to add.
undefined says if a contract uses the L1GatewayRouter to bridge an ERC20 token, the credit-back address set in `createRetryableTicket` is not the same as the conract itself
undefined says The excess ETH is refunded and if there is a mirrored contract on L2 with the appropriate functions ... well it can't access the funds since ... well lol the funds were credited to it's aliased address
undefined says what's the recommended way of getting around this issue
undefined says Can you provide your l1 tx hash? You can provide your tx hash here: https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/requests/new , after you submit, please let me know and give me your ticket number.
undefined says Hello, everyone. I am new here.
undefined says I am a phd student.
undefined says I have a question that in the official document this page is empty. https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/local_blockchain
undefined says The content should be about how to deploy Arbitrum in the local testnet.
undefined says Are segfaults normal when syncing a node? 😆
undefined says Hi, we currently do not support local testnet, but this page will come back when we support.
undefined says Could you please share your errors’ log?
undefined says ok
undefined says Info price L2DAO please
undefined says Hmm, don’t get what your mean.
undefined says 
undefined says How much 446 L2DAO?
undefined says Layer2Dao was not issued by us, not sure about this, please go to their discord and ask.
undefined says Wow the bar must be really high for PhD students these days
undefined says PhD, what is that? a new p2e game??
undefined says Hey quick question idk if this is the right place to ask.  ```JAVASCRIPT
IOutbox outbox = IOutbox(inbox.bridge().activeOutbox());
address l2Sender = outbox.l2ToL1Sender();
require(l2Sender == l2Target, "Greeting only updateable by L2");```
undefined says In one of the example contracts this is how they check if it is the correct "ARB" Contract calling the ETH Contract Function. Surely you can just do (msg.sender == l2target)?
undefined says Just asking to avoid the instance, where a contract address on L1 ends up with the same address as the L2 Contract, i've got deployed.
undefined says Hi, thanks for your advice, but we set l2Sender here is because this function is called by outbox, if you use msg.sender, it won’t execute successfully.
undefined says Well it executes perfectly fine, If you just change it to msg.sender? So idk what you mean
undefined says Also whoever the dev of your arbitrium examples is has also put up a pull-request for it https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/pull/46/commits/9262e7cf29994baf92c91852645d00d14b724965. So no. If you just use msg.sender, it works normally. Thats why I'm asking about the issue of a hash collision with L2 Address and Another contract on L1, that could then interact with you contract and pass the require
undefined says 
undefined says Ultimately, I just wanna know. how you guys avoid the situation of a L1 Contract having the same address as the L2 Contract . We assume here the calling contract, is set as a variable in your L1 Contract. Which is fine, in theory only the L2 Contract should be able to call it, because its address is hard coded. Obviously tho if a L1 Contract has the same address as your set L2 Contract. There is a security risk, of the L1 Contract with the same address just being able to call the function, and passing the require
undefined says Surely you can directly call this without outbox.sol. But if you send a call from l2, your tx on l1 need triggered by outbox.sol, which is here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Outbox.sol#L148 , if by this way, your tx will revert if use msg.sender, and this function is written to test l2 to l1 tx, so we should use outbox way.
undefined says We have address aliasing for this: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing
undefined says Yeah i've seen that, Ill test one more time to be extra sure before I message again
undefined says I've read literally all of the documentation, over the past month. Currently building a NFT bridge so just been deep in the docs. Currently doing the security aspect of the contract. So i'll message back, when I test again. Ty for the replies btw c:
undefined says Nice to hear that, Np.
undefined says I am trying to understand the `proveContinuedExecution` function in `arbitrum/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/challenge/Challenge.sol`. In which scenario will this function be called? Link and screenshot for convenience. https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e67da09b916627a2774c44ea6b322b2a5545f090/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/challenge/Challenge.sol#L212
undefined says Hey Styx, awesome to hear you're working on a NFT bridge.
That commit on the PR was incorrect (so it got closed instead of merged). I'd suggest you look at the updated version here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/pull/49
undefined says and curious to hear about your NFT bridge approach 🙂 DMs open
undefined says The reason for that is that the dissection happens over gas which doesn't necessarily translate into a single opcode executed (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-real-dissection-protocol)
So for example, if for some reason the execution of an opcode lies in the boundary of the different arbgas segments you still need to be able to prove that.
In this specific case you're proving that execution continued to the next boundary
undefined says The `proveContinuedExecution` method has a `_currentWin()` at the end. Why is the other player losing if we are only proving that execution continued to the next boundary? Did the other player not provide a proper set of `_chainHashes` in the previous call to `bisectExecution`?
undefined says yup
the idea is that the challengers both agree on the starting point of execution, but they disagree on the result. this means somewhere inbetween they started disagreeing about execution. they are dissecting to find the point at which they stop agreeing from.
so you are dissecting to find this upper point, and in this case the losing player had said it was up to this gas segment, but you are proving that execution went beyond that. so you win
undefined says Hi 👋🏼 
What is the block gas limit / target of Arbitrum?
undefined says Hi, block gas limit on arbitrum is different, instead we use gas limit per second, currently is 120k gas limit per second.
undefined says Thank you for the respond.
That is super low. Are you sure?
Even Ethereum is 1M gas per sec.
undefined says 
undefined says we measure gas in arbitrum using different units, arbgas
undefined says at the start mainnet beta the system handled roughly the same amount of gas per second as ethereum. 
we are increasing this limit slowly as we go, we are at about 50% more gas than ethereum mainnet now
undefined says I am looking through this https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-ts/scripts/deployStandard.ts  and I cannot find the solidity code for the generic ERC20 L2 proxy
undefined says It seems like tons and tons of bridged ERC20s on arbitrum are not verified on arbiscan and they all have identical bytecode
undefined says Lets get them verified. How  ?  what is the solidity source ?
undefined says EXAMPLES:

I asssume it is the generic L2 bridge proxy token.  What is the source ??
undefined says i found one hint... 'This contract was created by the contract code at 0x3fe38087a94903a9d946fa1915e1772fe611000f'
undefined says but that still isnt helping me too much
undefined says because that contract is ALSO unverified lmao
undefined says 💀
undefined says infura down for anyone else? their status page says no problems
undefined says Are you sure it's Infura? I think it's Aribturm.

undefined says looks like its back working again
undefined says Hey fred, Ty for the reply. I'll reach out in dms c:
undefined says Is there anyone I could talk to about the rpc rate limits?
undefined says Hi, do you mean when you use eth_call there is a limit? If you are running a node, there is a flag may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/releases/tag/v1.1.0
undefined says Hi, currently the arbiscan has some issues of those contract created by `create2`, the standard bridged token is created by this way, so currently there is no way to verify it, but every standard token on arbiscan has a bridged token flag which may help you.
undefined says What is the maximum size of the data payload per tx on Arbitrum? I ran into an issue where my tx was failing because I was calling a function in my contract with too many elements on the `update(bytes[] calldata _foo, address[] calldata _bar)` params.
How do I properly calculate the max amount of elements I can add to the call?
undefined says is there a statistical website showing how many unique active addresses are there on Arbitrum chain per day? (not total unique, but unique per day)
undefined says Currently Nansen supports this.
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/chart/tx and dune analytics
undefined says Hello, I've a project of 2D PFP NFTs on Ethereum and I would like to allow holders of these NFTs to be able to mint a 3D version on Arbitrum.  Is it possible to point to the Ethereum contract from a contract deployed on Arbitrum to allow Ethereum Holders to mint their 3D version on Arbitrum?  Thanks in advance :) 


TL;DR
Is there a way to prove ownership of an NFT on L1 via L2?
undefined says dev question here
undefined says is there any way to know the L1 block at which one L2 transaction has happened? we need to match L2 actions to L1 timestamps for some cross chain reasons
undefined says @JonasMtzgr
undefined says i think you should be able to paste whatever your token address is on L1
undefined says on our bridge
undefined says and have it bridged to L2
undefined says so it should be alot easier than that diagram you showed.
undefined says Thanks for taking the time!
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says I tried that, but got an error that the token wasn't bridged yet
undefined says With pointer to those docs
undefined says hmm
undefined says can you send me the etherscan address
undefined says Yes! One sec
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2d9519A8692De6E47fb9aFCECd67737c288737F
undefined says that's what I get.
undefined says ahh okay I see yeah that makes sense.
undefined says based on the docs, this script seems to be the easiest way to deploy: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts#bridge-a-standard-token
undefined says I can definitely relay your feedback to our devs though
undefined says which is not a complete dealbreaker ofc, but it requires me to download a huge repo that takes 10+min to download, store a copy of my private key on my local machine and give it to a script that I would probably have to read carefully first. Plus the explanation of this crucial step is limited to two paragraphs in a github readme of a sub-sub-subfolder of your repo. That doesn't scream battle tested infrastructure :/

Compare this to the optimism experience https://community.optimism.io/docs/guides/token-dev/#, which is literally just etherscan and metamask, two pieces of infrastructure I and millions of others already trust, explained nicely with screenshots.
undefined says I'd appreciate that!
undefined says definitely hear your concerns here - not a dev myself but improving the experience for both devs & users is key to a flourishing ecosystem!!
undefined says thank you 🙂 totally agree, that's why I reached out. The L2 user+dev experience has the potential to be 100x better than L1, and for optimism it may already be somewhat better, but Arbitrum just isn't there yet unfortunately
undefined says yeah already let my team know - and feel free to let us know when you launch here 😉
undefined says will do! probably just take another week. We're https://opencontracts.io
undefined says oooo
undefined says this is awesome
undefined says yeah def post in #🔨︱ecosystem-builder-announcements when you guys launch
undefined says Hi, you need use oracle to do this. Because l1 and l2 is different network.
undefined says Hi, if you want to know this inside contract, you can directly use `block.number`, if you want to know this via json-rpc, you can send `eth_getTransactionReceipt` request, you will see this at l1BlockNumber field.
undefined says how do I use the fraud proofs?
undefined says It is all still centralized unless you have been whitelisted to test a validator. In beta aka running with training wheels.
only whitelisted validators are enabled right now, there will be an announcement on discord when the ability to run validators is opened up
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
undefined says I can understand, you want to be a validator or a node?
undefined says yes I want to be whitelisted to be a validator node
undefined says how do I be whitelisted
undefined says Sorry, I haven't checked the information about the whitelist, and it may not be open yet. But please refer to the team's reply. @hunter | Offchain Labs @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 

Please be patient, I will continue to review relevant information, please be patient, team members or community members who know the situation, will recover. grateful
undefined says Ok I will wait for bfresh
undefined says Thanks for waiting, I'm also consulting other people and looking for more information.
I am also constantly learning, hoping to help users and build Arbitrum more.
undefined says Thank u for helping u are very nice mart
undefined says My pleasure.
undefined says Through various sources, I have reviewed, studied, researched and read carefully on the #🧠︱faq  channel. I provide the following information on how to become a validator.
You can check the information in the #🧠︱faq  channel from article 12-17, from which we can learn that the validator whitelist has not been released to the public for the time being and has not yet been launched.

In the meantime the validator information can be found in this quote.
"That said, given that Arbitrum is still a new, cutting edge, and complex system, we currently maintain various levels of control over the system while still in this early Beta phase; this includes contract upgradeability, the ability to pause the system, validator whitelisting, and token bridge whitelisting."

Also read the article "Fraud Proofs: How Validators Keep Arbitrum Honest", there are three types of validators, which you can learn more about. We can exchange and learn from each other.

undefined says More research tomorrow, I have to rest now, good night.:arbinauthelmet:
undefined says Hi, as @Mart (will NEVER DM you) said, validator has not opened registration yet, above this, rollups’ security is 1/n model rather than 51% model, which means although there are n-1 cheating validator(assume n is the total number of validators), if there is 1 honest validator, the honest one will always win the fraud proof challenge due to the challenge is executed on ethereum l1, so there is no need to run so many validators because it will waste the network resources. And there is also a critical node part on network, which is sequencer, because it will decide the tx order and the instant confirmation, and we will have a decentralized version of it in the future, you might like this, welcome to follow.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
undefined says Question - on bridge.arbitrum.io - why is the UI such that I have to enter the token address and then press return? It was far-from-obvious when using the bridge earlier, and required a workaround in our project's documentation: https://github.com/livepeer/docs/pull/165 cc. @adamsoffer.
undefined says You are referring to this place, right?
undefined says I think there should be three lists here. As long as the Arbitrum network is deployed, it should be possible to choose from Arbed Uniswap, Gemini, and CMC List. It's just that the three lists have not been opened yet.
It can only support the addition of contract addresses first. Sorry, it may be inaccurate, please refer to the information of the team members. @chrishobcroft
undefined says I am merely talking about the user interface implementation.

Right now, in order to configure an unlisted token, I follow this process:

1. Open bridge.arbitrum.io
2. Login (connect wallet)
3. Click the "Token" button
4. Enter token contract address
***5. PRESS RETURN***
6. See the token appear.

Attached is the view after step 4, which ought to display the token without an additional keystroke. It is step 5 which I believe is poor user experience and could be improved by _not_ requiring the user press return key.
undefined says Thanks for the detailed description, I get it. You want to enter the contract address, the token situation will be displayed automatically, instead of pressing Enter.
undefined says Many things are still in the making. Please be patient if it isn’t 100% how you would like, ARB team working on it.
undefined says Thanks for the suggestion, I also took it down and submitted it to management and the team. @chrishobcroft
undefined says Thanks for your suggestion, we believe arbitrum will get better and better
undefined says Hi, the token will automatically appear if your token is in the token list that you have selected. But now, there are some issues on the token list selection, but we will fix it after this weekend.
undefined says Hi, users can send tx to sequencer, and if the sequencer accept this tx, the tx will be executed by sequencer then give the instant outcome to the users. As for permissionless sequencer, we are now working on decentralized sequencer, but now it’s not permissionless.
undefined says All arbitrum nodes (including sequencer and validators) execute all transactions.  This is why anyone using a trusted RPC node is certain of the current chain state.  All nodes double check that execution matches the sequencer, and will stop with fatal error if there is any disagreement.
undefined says If sequencer dies between (1) and (2), next time when sequencer restart, it will batch those tx to l1 first, and then accept new tx from users.
undefined says Actually, (3) is made by validators rather than sequencer(they are 2 different type node), validators will assert a state and stake some token for this, if nobody challenge it’s asserted state or it win all the challenge after fraud proof window, it will have some reward, however, if it lose the challenge during the fraud proof windows, it will lost the stated funds.
undefined says If sequencer can carry with a state claimed, it power is too strong, if it choose to cheat, the affect will be supper bad, we do not want to see that.
undefined says Is this the Arbitrum emax is on now
undefined says Saw alot on twitter that emax is now on layer2 arbitrum
undefined says The reward comes from the cheating validators’ slashed token and also the network fee.
undefined says Please follow arbitrum's twitter or emax's twitter for related news, I am not sure about this.
undefined says Detailed introduction：https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says Does Arbitrum use ETH for staking?
undefined says Or it's not needed as there is only one sequencer rn?
undefined says Validators stake, not sequencers. 
You can read the link content and screenshot content.
https://medium.com/offchainlabs/fraud-proofs-and-validators-how-you-or-anyone-can-keep-arbitrum-honest-d68add3f6c5d
undefined says how does the sequencer get punished in case of fraud if they don't stake? (assuming in the future the sequencer is permissionless)
undefined says If an active validator commits fraud, the active validator will lose the staked funds. You can read the link below about the case where the sequencer doesn't work.
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
undefined says 
undefined says I think you should separate sequencer and validator, they are not the same concept
undefined says The sequencer is a special Arbitrum full node which is, under normal conditions, responsible for submitting users’ transactions into the L2 system. In principle, a chain’s sequencer can take different forms; as Arbitrum One currently stands, the sequencer is simply centralized; eventually, the sequencer will consist of a distributed committee of independent parties which come to consensus.
undefined says right and these parties are identified beforehand or anyone can participate as a sequencer?
undefined says The sequencer is a specially designated full node, which is given limited power to control the ordering of transactions. This allows the sequencer to guarantee the results of user transactions immediately, without needing to wait for anything to happen on Ethereum
undefined says Sequencer won‘t stake, only validators can stake the state. Sequencer only the part to batch users’ tx and give the users instant confirmation.
undefined says 👍 👍
undefined says Currently offchain labs hold the sequencer, but it will be permissionless when we upgrade sequencer to decentralized version.
undefined says When will the decentralized version go live?
undefined says We currently do not have a tl for this, when we are ready, we will have an announcement.
undefined says Understood, thanks
undefined says can you please share how the decentralized sequencer version will work?
undefined says This is how the sequencer works.

undefined says Hello, I have some questions regarding `transferExitAndCall` method in `L1ArbitrumExtendedGateway`. I'm implementing a simple fast exit protocol with a liquidity pool to facilitate fast withdrawal from Arbitrum to Ethereum. 
1. Is there a way to test the exits without waiting for the minimum challenge period in testnet?
2. Would it be possible to point me towards an example use of the `transferExitAndCall` method?
3. Is there a recommended way to check if the exit has been triggered? Also what would be the outcome of `transferExitAndCall` if the exit is already triggered? 
Thank you!

undefined says hi guys, im wondering do the validators propose the rollup block into the l1 rollup contract? is there any fees required for this process?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_basics
undefined says sorry, what i mean is since the rollup contract and its friends in the EthBridge track the states of the proposed rollup blocks, is it achieved by the caller (validator) to transfer the states into the contract?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Friends, you can wait for a team member to answer you:offchain:
undefined says thanks ser
undefined says Hi, validators will propose rollups block(which also called rollups node), here is the main contract for validators to do that: 0x4442a659aaa27eEDdf0A5d6eF7659290E92F678C , and rollups contract here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xC12BA48c781F6e392B49Db2E25Cd0c28cD77531A#readProxyContract
undefined says thanks bro
undefined says Np
undefined says Hey all - im ready to deploy a contract to Arbitrum One, anyone know a way to estimate gas before I deploy?
undefined says Hi, do you use hardhat? You can use hardhat-gas-reporter which is a plug-in can help you with that.
undefined says Thanks for the reply! I do use hardhat and have hardhat-gas-reporter installed, I can see the average gas consumption to deploy my contract would be 2165623  units of gas, on mainnet I'd do 2165623  (gas units) * (gas price per unit - from GasStation) to get the gas fee in gwei but I have no idea how to get gas price per unit for Arbitrum?
undefined says Right, if so, you can use estimateGas and the data args with your contract’s byte code data.
undefined says Your a legend, thank you ser, estimateGas from the contract factory gave me what I need
undefined says Np.
undefined says The IP address located in US.
undefined says Hi, is there anyway I can get all transactions within a period for a specific token (basically the export csv functionality without the 5k limit) with the api or otherwise?
undefined says Don’t know if there is a public api for this, maybe you can try to search if the graph have such a sub graph.
undefined says What do you mean by graph?
undefined says https://thegraph.com , but not sure if there is a such one.
undefined says I'll try looking around there, thanks!

I think I found a hacky way to maybe do it using event logs. One basic question though, is there a way to get the 'quantity' value from these?
undefined says I think it has to do with the data field, can't figure out how to determine the decimal point though

So when converting to decimal: 
(`0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c30731cec03200000`) -> 520000000000000000000 
Supposed to be 520

(`0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007ef761777df52f9093`) -> 2342115413470380789907
Supposed to be 2342.115413470380789907
undefined says I feel like I'm missing something, but how do you determine where the decimal point is to get the correct quantity from the hex value in `data`
undefined says If you use ethersjs or web3js, there are some api for you to do this, such as in web3js, you can call `fromWei` method.
undefined says oh boy, was hoping to avoid that. Thanks for the info though, I'll try them out!
undefined says did not get your point, can you explain more?
undefined says The only information I know is located in US, not sure which state.
undefined says You don't have to use another library. Just divide the value by 10^18 and you'll have the decimal in the right spot.
undefined says Oh dang, thank you! Didn't realise it was consistent
undefined says We may not be able to provide more detailed information
undefined says hi guys, just wanna know is the sequencer a sort of the aggregator?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
undefined says thanks ser, so the sequencer submits transactions in batches just as the aggregator right?
undefined says I don't think so
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_basics
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says 
undefined says It is recommended to read the documentation carefully first, and you will have a comprehensive understanding.
undefined says ok thanks bro
undefined says Since it takes about 10 minutes until transaction data is posted in the L1 Sequencer Inbox, which means the price of gas can fluctuate in that period, what happens if you overpay or underpay for a transaction?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs  please del it 👆
undefined says maybe have what you want：https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#full-nodes
undefined says This statement in the whitepaper reads ```The creator of a VM designates a set of managers
for the VM. The Arbitrum protocol provides an any-trust
guarantee: any one honest manager can force the VM to
behave according to the VM’s code...``` The manager(s) (which I'm assuming is an actor (human)) ensures the trust of the VM code? why is that necessary or essential?
undefined says The manager can be a validator or even a full node. For validators, because rollups is a 1/n model which the honest validators will always win due to the proof happens on ethereum, so 1 honest validator is enough even others n-1 validators are attackers. And for any fullnode, it can choose not to trust sequencer or even validators, it can just read l1 inbox’s l2 tx calldata and execute them, if it is honest, it will get the correct state, so it doesn’t need to trust any others.
undefined says Hey how much data in like GB goes thru arbitrum, including anything I’d need to replay and validate anything that happened on chain?
undefined says Hey guys, does arbitrum use `block.basefee` and `tx.gasprice` in the same way as Ethereum? I have a contract that requires a transaction's gasprice to be within a range of its block's basefee and am wondering if that will work without changes on Arbitrum as well.
undefined says The database is around 100GB right now
undefined says Arbitrum gas price works a bit different than mainnet. There are no block.basefee and tx.gasprice return the gas bid of the tx. Note that gas bid of a tx is the maximum gas price the signer is willing to pay, but not the actual gas price charged. https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/solidity_support
undefined says how fast does it grow?
undefined says Is there anything that lets us return gas fee that's actually used by the transaction?
undefined says Hey guys! Is there a way to get -almost- instant confirmation on cross-messages from L1 to L2?

After checking the docs and tutorials, the L1 tx would go to the Sequencer's Inbox but it could still take up to 10 minutes for a confirmation.

I read that when submitting txs on L2 you have instant confirmation if you use the Sequencer instead of an aggregator so I was wondering if there's a similar process the other way around. Thanks!
undefined says You can call `gasleft()` to get how much gas you have used, and you can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L13 to get gas price, and here is the address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Hi, if you want to send l1-l2 tx, there is no such way to give you an instant confirmation, because l1 and l2 are actual 2 different blockchain network, the txn goes to sequencer can get instant confirmation is because this is not cross layer txn, just l2 txn.
undefined says It depends on your storage performance, if you use high speed NVMe, it only takes 3-4 days, but if you use others, it may take more than 1 week.
undefined says No I mean like
undefined says How much bigger does the database get every day
undefined says around 20gb/month，but it still depends on the user activities.
undefined says ok cool thank you
undefined says http://research.arbitrum.io/
undefined says I'll join the discussion tomorrow, thanks to the team for the research forum.
undefined says Glad to hear it!
undefined says Hi, I am not able to understand how the protocol decides which node will generate the next Arbitrum block. Can someone please explain? Another question: Since arbitrum does not have a native token, how is the team planning to make money?
undefined says Perfect. Thank you!
undefined says About how Arbitrum makes money: 
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#fees

For which node to validate the block, you can refer to the following link: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#full-nodes
undefined says Hi, I'm doing research on different bridges - I wonder if Arbitrum bridge pose an upper limit on the amount of token you can transfer?
undefined says also i wonder what's the validation method does Arbitrum use for "transaction events". I've read from the document that mentions using "Gateway" to facilitate cross chain transfer. I wonder what exactly is a gateway and what's its difference from "light client & relayers"?
undefined says I think there should be no limit
undefined says Gateway : Pairs of contracts (one on L1, one on L2) that implement a particular type of cross chain asset bridging.
undefined says Here is a detailed introduction to the Arbitrum Bridge, I think it   can  help you https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets
undefined says Much appreciated for your answer!
undefined says you are welcome😆
undefined says Also do you have any idea on how the bridge deploys asset on the target chain - like whether it needs permission or not?
undefined says I've glance through the document and couldn't really find relevant info :p
undefined says Everyone can bridge token from l1 to l2, it’s permissionless, and the official bridge uses lock-mint way to bridge your assets, not liquidity way.
undefined says I seee. so what you mean is that if it requires a liquidity pool it might need a certain permission for the token to be deployed?
undefined says What I mean is we are not liquidity way so you need not afraid there is an upper bound for you to transfer your assets.
undefined says There are also some 3rd part liquidity bridges allow you to transfer assets(they have the upper bound limit), but they can provide fast transaction and no need to wait 7-8 days.
undefined says Yes that I understand. I think I'm asking a different question - like can someone just bridge "any" token to the target chain. If I were to bridge a new token, do I need to go through  an application - to request for permission?
undefined says take Synapse for example - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsHV4nIO23E-IHL8nu1qCOz2rGcPvbJQCgWubUVRME9uboLg/viewform
undefined says Our official bridge can just use to transfer assets between ethereum and arbitrum, there is no permission you need request, but you need run a script first and then the UI can allow you to transfer.
undefined says Got it. Really helpful. Thank you!
undefined says Happy to help!
undefined says Hey admin, I want to conribute to the arbitrum contracts. Who can I contract for any query?
undefined says Hi, If you have any optimizations to our contract, please feel free to make a pr on our github: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/
undefined says Or if you find bugs, you can request for a bounty here: https://immunefi.com/bounty/arbitrum/
undefined says Cool. tx
undefined says hi, just used arbitrum bridge for the first time. on arbiscan it‘s now showing the eth i transferred as balance under the same public address as on mainnet - so far so good. however under transactions arbiscan shows, that my eth was transferred from this address to another address „Arbitrum: ArbRetryableTx“. What is this transfer, why was it done? And if the Eth was transferred away from my address to this address, why does my address still show the eth as balance on arbiscan?
undefined says 
undefined says hope that makes any sense what i wrote 🙂 grateful for help!
undefined says it's correct you can find it on L2 in your wallet, please check your address under Arbitrum network
undefined says thanks yeah it’s there
undefined says but what is this transaction in the bottom of the screenshot?
undefined says what is this recipient ArbRetryableTx?
undefined says could you please share the transaction ID

undefined says https://metamask.app.link/send/0x645761BB5aE21CF4c0703D4db6fE899CCd0BBC70@1?value=1e18
undefined says Same here.  Also, I don't see the balance shown on Arbiscan in my Brave wallet which still shows zero AETH balance, so I can not send my AETH anywhere. Is it an issue or there is some time that needs to pass for AETH to be shown in my wallet? I can see my AETH balance from Zerion, but can not send anyway.
undefined says @Roody Here may help you: 
0x00...6e is a special built-in contract ArbRetryableTx.  when you bridge stuff from L1 it gets picked up by that.

For more details, please inquire:

undefined says Why do withdrawals take 8days to process? I was under the impression that the fraud proof dispute period started when my transaction was submitted to the layer-1
undefined says i.e. - I should be able to withdraw about a week after I made my transaction. Not a week after I try to withdraw
undefined says hey @hunter | Offchain Labs ! Just noticed that my cry for help was heard by the devs, and the token bride now supports automatically bridging standard erc20s. Much better experience! Please let the devs know that their work and swift action is highly appreciated!
undefined says actually, I don't think it worked. It looks like all transactions went through, but the new token address just isn't getting calculated. It seems that this set of contracts might represent the token on Arbitrum: 
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0611cfc667129d6e4b49c92c37184262acddafbc, at least it links to a token tracker page that has the correct token name, with max supply equalling the supply deposited into Arbitrum. But where is the contract with the actual erc20 logic?
undefined says Thank you. Suddenly today everything works fine. Now I can see AETH balance and I successfully sent my AETH to another address 🙂
undefined says The wallet was updated, but today suddenly everything works fine and the job was successfully done.
undefined says Hi, those bridged token is created by cloneable way, and this is an upgradable contract, if you want to know the actual of standard bridged token, you can see it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/StandardArbERC20.sol
undefined says Hi, the reason why you need around 8 days is there is a waiting queue and the validators male stake also need some times, so it will a little longer than 7 days.
undefined says Lemme get back to you on this fren, asking internally
undefined says https://etherscan.io/token/0xa2d9519a8692de6e47fb9afcecd67737c288737f#readContract
undefined says you would just have to click on the token tracker itself
undefined says via the link you gave me
undefined says What are the requirements to run a node?
undefined says Thanks @hunter | Offchain Labs ! It did work, at least the protocol runs correctly. What confused me was that the arbitrum contract at the arbitrum token address doesn't have an erc20 interface - instead, it seems to use fallbacks to 'pretend' like it does. Could you confirm with the devs if/why that is the case? Would like to have a good mental model for it before I tell our users to trust it
undefined says you can refer to the  tutorial : https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says For AWS, r5d.2xlarge is recommended .
undefined says We recently switched to z1d instances, lower latency NVMe allows booting from fully synced database around 10-15 minutes
undefined says ok thank you for all your answers
undefined says Hi, I've been sync'ing my local node for a few days, the latest arbi block looks to be ~7811253, but my node just passed that block num. `{"level":"info","component":"txdb","start":"7928892","count":2...` what does the start value represent if not the block num?
undefined says The version you are running outputs the log number
undefined says ok, is there a way to determine where I am at in the sync? I am just trying to get an ETA until fully synced
undefined says You can compare the `eth_blockNumber` returned from your rpc with the actual block number.
undefined says Hey everyone, I really like the research website!

I recently read this post: https://research.arbitrum.io/t/l2-compute-gas-pricing/22 and the ideas there totally make sense. 

However, I have another question: how do you charge users for the pubdata bytes? 

The price for L1 calldata may not really correlate with the L2 speed limit usage. I am really interested in how L2 arbgas price is formed and how the system makes sure that the operator is never undepaid in highly volatiel L1 gas market. Thanks!
undefined says Regarding Arbgas, the content of the link should help you.
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas
Thanks very much for your support of Arbitrum https://research.arbitrum.io/ , which is a good way to get technical exchanges.
undefined says It’s because all tokens bridged through our standard bridge use the same smart contract code (it’s deployed through our factory)
undefined says The article mostly describes managing of ArbGas related to execution, but not publishing the public data on-chain (which is actually most of the computation)
undefined says The load speed of my z1d instance is only 50MB/s, it consumes 1.5 hour to load. Is your db 100GB+ or pruned?
undefined says Old speed doesn’t matter as much as latency
undefined says And it doesn’t matter if database is archive or pruned, only the latest snapshot is loaded on startup.
undefined says My development machine has Seagate 4TB FireCuda 530 PCIe Gen4, and it takes 10-15 minutes to start
undefined says Did you manually mount the NVMe drive?  The z1d instance does not automatically mount it
undefined says But you said z1d also has such speed while z1d is shared instead of dedicated.
undefined says Yes, I manually mount the NVMe
undefined says And you confirmed that the database is being stored on the nvme partition?
undefined says Yes, loading speed on gp3 EBS is only 10MB/s
undefined says Maybe you can use `htop` to observe the loading speed on your z1d next time.
undefined says Hi guys
undefined says Where can i find information about Arbitrum validator node?
undefined says Currently offchainlabs run the validators. 
validation hasn't been open yet! stay tuned fren.
undefined says I got it. Thank bro!
undefined says hey, how do we enable tracing? I've tried passing in `--node.rpc.tracing.enable=True"` to the latest offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.2.1-baf03bb but i'm getting `unknown flag: --node.rpc.tracing.enable`
undefined says Hi, we are not currently supporting it in this latest version, but you can use it on arbiscan. We might have it available in the next release.
undefined says Is the process of deploying smart contracts to Arbitrum the same as every other EVM -combatable blockchain? I'm considering deploying my protocol native to Arbitrum instead of ETH mainnet
undefined says Hi，it is same as others evm chains, but gas cost is different, here explains why: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas
undefined says ORUs are awesome, I took quite a bit of time to study them. Does Offchain labs do hackathons, grants, or incubator programs?
undefined says Hackathons: https://www.notion.so/Prizes-Scaling-Ethereum-1d3a6c2966dd4d8fa679d78890f2f8a6#13c4d3a0308e4f11a0779119993f8b00

Grants, or incubator programs, arbitrum don't currently offer grants though.
undefined says Hello there, I’m trying to write a contract to use L1 gateway router to deposit ERC20 token to Arbitrum. L1 gateway will send deposit message to `Inbox` contract, with refund addresses (excess fee, call value) set to `msg.sender`, which is a contract in my situation. 

And I find that `Inbox` contract will transform refund addresses to L2 alias when they are contracts, as the code showing in the below link:

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e98d14873dd77513b569771f47b5e05b72402c5e/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L334-L343

How could I access those ETH refunded to L2 alias address for my L1 contract? Thanks!
undefined says The greeter tutorial https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter may help you with retryable messages and address-aliasing.
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing
undefined says Thanks for the doc and example, they are quite helpful.

I see the following section in the doc but could not find further details about what's the path for L1 contract to recover the funds. Do you have any suggestion? I have ETH stuck in the L2 alias address 🥲

```
... if the provided beneficiary or credit-back-address is an L1 contract address, the address will be converted to its address alias, providing a path for the L1 contract to recover the funds.
```
undefined says You could try `ArbRetryableTx.redeem(redemption-txn-id)` as stated in the next paragraph. https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/arbretryabletx
undefined says Thank you so much for the guidance. I will try it out 💪
undefined says 1. What hardware does the current sequencer run on? 
2. With decentralized sequencers, can we expect similar hardware requirements?
3. How does Arbitrum One expect to compete with L2 solutions like zk Porter that can porcess 30,000+ TPS where arbitrum one can process only 2000 TPS (correct me if i'm wrong)

Please note : question number 3 is related to a single composable layer (aka do not include AnyTrust Chains)
undefined says The sequencer is run by the team, and third-party sequencers are not currently supported.
undefined says Thanks for your reply. 
Yes I understand that but my question is - what hardware does the sequencer run on? 

Is it solana level or rasberry pie level or somwhere in the middle?
undefined says I hope this document can help you：https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
undefined says You can refer to the node configuration, but please take the team member's reply as the correct answer
undefined says In the future, Arbitrum will be further upgraded: Arbitrum Nitro, TPS will be greatly improved
undefined says Thanks for the link to the article. I have already read this article. 

But again, this does not answer my questions. Looking forward to replies from the team
undefined says Arbitrum nitro does not improve throughput that comes anywhere near zk-porter. Nitro will still be limited by geth.
undefined says I will copy paste the message again, so that someone from the team can confirm. I would appreciate exact answers to my questions
undefined says 1. What hardware does the current sequencer run on? 
2. With decentralized sequencers, can we expect similar hardware requirements?
3. How does Arbitrum One expect to compete with L2 solutions like zk Porter that can porcess 30,000+ TPS where arbitrum one can process only 2000 TPS (correct me if i'm wrong)

Here are some hardware references
undefined says Roll-ups as a scaling solution are incredibly powerful

While we've reached capacity limits for many L1s, the limits for roll-ups have barely been tested

arbitrum，with the highest theoretical max TPS
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks for your replies Mobang. 

In terms of hardware requirement - noted. Thanks for pointing me to that 

In terms of the TPS mentioned here as 40,000 is very misleading as shown in this thread between Haseeb and Polyna 

https://twitter.com/hosseeb/status/1499813360489025538
undefined says And correct me if I'm wrong, those numbers have since been removed
undefined says Regarding the arbitrum nitro upgrade,
1 Fees will drop. 
2 Throughput will increase. We can handle more transaction volume without causing network congestion and rising fees
3 will be further compatible with many tools used by developers today. This allows for better interaction with existing chains and technologies.
undefined says In addition to the upgrade brought by nitro. Vitalik Buterin said that Rollups can bring Ethereum 2.0 TPS to 100k TPS, which proves that there is a lot of room for improvement in the future, isn't it great? Do you agree with Vitalik Buterin?
undefined says Finally, as the Offchain Labs team claims, Arbitrum is not just an optimism rollup solution, they will introduce other scaling solutions based on zero knowledge proofs, and will continue to refine the Arbitrum One op roll 2 solution ❤️
undefined says I agree with everything you said about arbitrum nitro

Regarding what Vitalik said - He is right of course. But he was adding up all the TPS for all rollups combined. Not for a single composable layer.

"Arbitrum will build zk tech" - Fair enough
undefined says @Mobang （will NEVER DM you） are you from the Arbitrum team?
undefined says Sir, I am just a community volunteer, I hope you can have a pleasant experience in the arbitrum community and respond in a timely manner
undefined says sir,could i use Arbitrum in Cent OS ?
undefined says Sorry, I am not very clear about this, I suggest you consult the Cent OS community.
undefined says You mean you want to deploy an arbitrum node on cent OS?
undefined says yes
undefined says If your architecture is x86/x64, of course you can, we use docker to run our node.
undefined says cent os x64
undefined says You can follow this guide: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says OK. I'm installing Arbitrum.
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Np.
undefined says Looking into running either an aggregator or archival node on mainnet; haven't been able to find any useful documentation on node configuration for setting this up. Are there any useful links besides https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node for this? Or at least like, a mock config file with comments for various config params?
undefined says Was hoping there'd be documentation for this somewhere in the official docs but I can't seem to dig any up
undefined says Is there any way to estimate arbgas using hardhat/ethers of daptools which both give mainnet gas estimates in testing without having to deploy @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says `eth_estimategas` with the contract byte code gives an estimate
undefined says Where and how do u do that? What toolkit and what part of the process
undefined says And it’s arbgas?
undefined says https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter
undefined says But it’s eth Gas not arb Gas no?
undefined says @StrategicHash we’re building optimistic technologies because we believe they are fundamentally more scalable & decentralized https://medium.com/offchainlabs/optimistic-rollups-the-present-and-future-of-ethereum-scaling-60fb9067ae87

undefined says This docs can guide you to run an archive node, just as describe, you need run node with `--node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000` .
undefined says These are the only two argument changes needed between an
 archive node and relayer/repeater?
undefined says I've been working with geth and avax recently so please forgive me for being uh 

Pessimistic?'
undefined says Yes, if you need any other options, you can also add them.
undefined says _if only they were documented_
undefined says I’m talking about estimating (arbitrum) gas for particular function calls not deployment @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Thanks
undefined says You can deploy it to testnet, and test the function call on testnet, it’s supper easy to do this.
undefined says yeah i was saying without deployment. Like a test by test gas output in the CI when running like you can do on for mainnet application testing with hardhat or dapptools
undefined says Hello! I'm from the Lido integration team, and we are researching the best option to bridge our tokens to Arbitrum. At first, looks like it will be enough for us to use the standard ERC20 gateway, but in the future, it might require adding new logic to the token on the Arbitrum side. So, we are considering two options: using standard `L1/L2ERC20Gateway` or developing a completely custom gateway. Will be great if you help with some questions:
1) Is it possible to upgrade the default implementation of the tokens deployed by the `L2ERC20Gateway`, by request from our side, to add some additional logic to L2Token?
2) What is the process for registration token's gateways via the trustful method `L1GatewayRouter.setGateways()` method?
Thank you!
undefined says Hi, we are trying to read logs from some old transactions (< 1M in block number), and noticed the API becomes very slow. Is there an option on the node that can speed up log filtering on old transactions? Thank you.
undefined says By log I mean event
undefined says This question, I think, can only wait for the answer from the team members.
undefined says Hi, if you want to upgrade your erc20 token in the future, i will recommend you use the custom way to deploy your token with eip1967 way. In custom way, you can deploy your token first and then register to the gateway, here is the examples: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging , but remember you need implement our IArbToken interface like this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/custom-token-bridging/contracts/L2Token.sol . And before you register to the mainnet, you should test it on our rinkeby testnet first.
undefined says If so, I don’t think there is such a way to do this, because hardhat hasn’t 100% supported AVM yet.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Any chance you know the answer to my question? Much appreciated
undefined says That’s what I thought. Is there anyway to do standard eth Gas metrics using something like hardhat and convert those numbers to arbgas? Thanks for ur time
undefined says Maybe you need to reduce the number of logs asking at a time.
undefined says I don’t know if there is such a way to do this since hardhat is not 100% support avm.
undefined says Thanks for your response, @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs. We considered an option to use `CustomGateway`, but in our case, it will require users to wrap tokens before the transfer cause our token is not upgradable on L1 and doesn't implement the `IArbToken` interface. Additional wrapping is not good from the UX perspective, and we would like to avoid it. Looks like the best option for us is a gateway developed by ourselves and integrated into the token bridge, as it has done for DAI and Livepeer tokens. Can we use such an option? As I understood, this will allow us to implement bridging without additional wrapping and take control of the L2 token proxy with the ability to upgrade implementation in the future by ourselves. Also, it brings some benefits, like the ability to implement pausing for L1 to L2 transfers, which we probably would like to have.
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs ,I met this problem when installing Arbitrum on the Cent OS. Could you help me ?
undefined says Though Arbitrum whitepaper request MAC OS or Ubuntu , it claims that if you install necessary dependencies, you can run Arbitrum on other OS.
undefined says We recommend you to run arbitrum through docker setup: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node , this could be better.
undefined says Got it, I will communicate with team about this.
undefined says Your mean is that i could not install Arbitrum locally? And I have the other question,if I run arbitrum through docker,could I use for my private chain ?(I need to do experience test)
undefined says I just saw you skip some steps such as yarn build. If you want to run your own local arbitrum network, we currently do not support such a tutorial for this.
undefined says emmm，i finished those steps including setting native setup instructions, but i still could run 'yarn install:validator'.
undefined says Did you run this through yum? https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation#native-setup-instructions
undefined says Yes, I installed it step by step from whitepaper.
undefined says I set native setup instructions with Fedora shell.
undefined says And I run those shell fluently.
undefined says Got it, I need check with the node engineer, since I am not familiar with node, will get back once I have checked.
undefined says Hi, this may due to you outdated git, you can try to update your git install. Also you can comment-out l24-l26 here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e98d14873dd77513b569771f47b5e05b72402c5e/packages/arb-avm-cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L24-L26
undefined says if you comment out lines in CMakeLists.txt you run the chance of using incorrect file versions, so not recommended.  We unfortunately cannot provide support for every OS/distribution because there are too many variations.  Running inside docker does not prevent you from doing anything, you just need to expose the ports properly.
undefined says Ok, thanks for @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs and @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs .I have tried these solutions  to do, but it still could not solute my problem. I am trying to use docker to run arbitrum, thanks for your help!
undefined says Excuses me, when I deploy the contract，I have a question that  is the contract actually deployed on layer1 or layer2?
undefined says And my second question is how could I deploy a contract on Arbitrum? I read the white paper, there is an example of deploying dapp-pet-shop, but I don't understand how he wants to deploy? Does he want me to download the project from github, then modify the configuration file by myself, and finally deploy it to  layer1 ?  // https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/demo-dapp-pet-shop
undefined says If you have free time, please give me answer! Thank you !
undefined says I think i have soluted this problem.
undefined says is there any information available about the physical arbitrum sequencer? Like if I wanted to colocate my node with it (or put it geographically as close as possible)
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
According to the link, there is no physical sequencer content.
undefined says According to the details of the sequencer
undefined says It is a full node, there should only be node devices, and there is no physical sequencer.
undefined says I was reading about the cross chain functionality and have a question, is there a way to read data from L1 on arbitrum without waiting for the dispute period? For example I am just trying to verify an owner of an ERC721 on L1 from arbitrum
undefined says I didn’t see any read only examples in the doc
undefined says Hi, you can just use oracle to read this, although arbitrum built on ethereum, they are 2 different network.
undefined says Ok, I wasn’t sure if the cross chain functionality had a different behavior than other chains. Thank you.
undefined says Hello, I don't know in which channel to ask this question: I'm part of the moonbeam development team (a layer 1 ethereum like on the polkadot ecosystem), we are currently studying all the layer 2 solutions we could use to scale our network.
Do you think it would be possible for us to deploy an arbitrum chain on our blokchain, and if so, does it require specific developments ?
I understand that Arbitrum is currently only deployed on the ethereum network, so I'm wondering how ready or not the code is to be deployed on other layer 1.
undefined says As far as I know, Arbitrum should not be deployed on other chains
undefined says because Arbitrum is an off-chain scaling solution for Ethereum, and it is still under development.
undefined says But you can also reach out to a team member to exchange more information.
undefined says >The sequencer is a special Arbitrum full node

where is this special full node located?
undefined says I assume it has to be located in the meatspace?
undefined says Our code is open source, someone also used our code to deploy a layer2 network on Xdai. But I am not sure how they did this.
undefined says Sequencer can give user immediate confirmation because it can order the tx and then push it to l1. The fullnode doesn’t have this function, they can only push the tx to l1 without knowing the order or relay the tx to sequencer.
undefined says yea. but the sequencer is a full node with special permissions, right? Like a server in a data center running a full node + sequencer code and pushing the TXs? I just wanna know where it is so I can put my node near it
undefined says Yup. 
Sorry due to some security concerns we cannot tell you the location of the sequencer.
undefined says well I mean I'm just gonna reverse engineer it 🤷‍♂️
undefined says obscurity just gives those who have the resources/ability to figure out where it is an edge
undefined says Hey do you wanna send me a DM? We can talk further there
undefined says > Execution is deterministic -- which means that the chain’s behavior is uniquely determined by the contents of its inbox. Because of this, the result of your transaction is knowable as soon as your transaction has been put in the inbox. Any Arbitrum node will be able to tell you the result. (And you can run an Arbitrum node yourself if you want.)
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-big-picture
undefined says hey guys im currently researching arbitrum right now and i have some questions. 
-whats the incentive to run a full node? mostly im confused about the fact that users can just send transactions to a sequencer which can provide a transaction's true result while a full node can only predict a transactions result will be.
-why would users ever send transactions to a full node over a sequencer?
undefined says Hello dear Arbitrum peeps. I’ve been told you guys do excellent devrel, and as an aspiring devrel person i’d like to ask one of you a few questions so i can grow as a professional and ultimately make the crypto space better. Who might i best reach out to privately?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/censorship_resistance
undefined says It is recommended to read the above first
undefined says You can ask your questions on this #📬︱support  channel and a team member will reply
undefined says Thank you so much for your recognition and support of Arbitrum. You are also very welcome to participate in the development of Arbitrum
undefined says You can also read more information on technical development. #🔗︱links
undefined says thanks for that. seems like using a full node instead of a sequencer for submitting transactions is more of an exception. not a very common way to submit transactions as there are big trade offs to submitting transactions to a full node. why would someone want to run a full node if most transactions are just routed through the sequencer?
undefined says There is a difference between a sorter and a node
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_basics
undefined says It is still recommended to read the documentation information first, you will know more and more complete information.
undefined says 3rd party node can provider faster response time to non-mutating `eth_call` and with higher rate-limit; there are no protocol level incentive to run full node
undefined says cool thanks
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs would you happen to have a second to help me understand contract deployment costs for mainnet? I'm using estimateGas as you mention here https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/948886161294753792 but I can't figure out how to get to the full fee for deployment @xiaoming（will never DM you）
undefined says https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1507393279037480984
undefined says hey guys, BlockVision just supported Arbitrum with a wide range of APIs and a comprehensive development toolkit. Try it out at blockvision.org and start building on Arbitrum now👷
undefined says Did you figure this out? Having the same sorta problem fren
undefined says Did you get the gas needed from eth_estimateGas feedback? When you get it, you can call `eth_gasPrice`, and then multiply those two, you will get what you want.
undefined says Can you provide some details of the problems you met?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs this is my script:
`
async function main() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
    "https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/APIKEY"
  );

  const gasPrice = (await provider.getGasPrice()).toNumber();
  console.log("GAS PRICE", gasPrice, "wei");
  const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("Traits");
  const data = Contract.getDeployTransaction().data;

  const gasEstimate = (
    await provider.estimateGas({
      data: data,
    })
  ).toNumber();

  console.log("Contract Gas Limit Estimate", gasEstimate);
}
`
undefined says and this is the output from running, but I'm not sure how to use these numbers to get an actual ETH cost:
`
No need to generate any newer typings.
GAS PRICE 568448751 wei
Contract Gas Limit Estimate 24654555`
undefined says Hi, use `gasPrice` * `gasEstimate`.
undefined says so that would be: 14014850996210804 wei =>  0.014014850996210804 ETH?
undefined says Yup
undefined says When I sum this up across all of my contracts, the sum total is `Total Costs: 64337308239942056 wei => 0.064337308239942056 ETH` however, my deployment quickly ran out of funds for gas when the wallet had .16ETH in it. Is there a chance I'm missing something?
undefined says when I try and deploy one of the contracts in Remix IDE, the gas limit is **83772508**
undefined says Have you sent that tx? If so, can you share with me your tx hash?
undefined says I'm having a hard time finding the correct tx because my deployment script creates many contracts during its execution and it failed halfway. I have an example of a simple contract that is showing me different gas estimates between REMIX and my script above if that would help @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Remix estimates 83772508, estimateGas returns 56530
undefined says for instance this transaction:  https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x47284de1e6a38b327ff010fe6c7ad083059b4a0ec2f3db29e7c7bf23aff67109

The gasEstimate in my script is: 24,654,555
When it was deployed, the gas limit was: 55,847,213

When it was deployed, the gas price was .44 and the total cost was 0.02241344895896 ETH
However, with gas at 0.536669138 (right now), the total cost estimate is 0.01323133877962359 ETH
undefined says Did you separate run gasEstimate and contract deployment? I guess is your solidity compiler version is different between those 2 steps, and cause the byte code different. Please make sure you use the same compiler version, also you can run them in the same script. Above this, next time you can use our testnet to deploy first, so you won’t waste your ethers.
undefined says the gas price is different on the testnet, but can I use the gas estimates from the testnet to determine what the mainnet gas estimate would be?
undefined says What I mean is your can run those steps on testnet first, if they run successfully, you can run it again on mainnet. Sometimes the gas cost will be different from testnet and mainnet, because the gas cost will be cheaper if this bytecode has been deployed on the same network before.
undefined says oh, my main concern is determining exactly how much to fund my wallet with without running out since the scripts aren't idempotent (I'd like them to be but it would take a good amt of time now)
undefined says confirmed theyre both using the same compiler version 0.8.7
undefined says Also, you need to add `from` in your script. Just checked on my side, it works.
undefined says oh maybe that's the issue? let me try
undefined says adding from to the estimateGas calls throws an out of gas exception
undefined says Did you add it to this script?
undefined says Yes that’s the one
undefined says 
undefined says Does your `from` address have enough funds to deploy this contract? If not, the call will revert. You can try this rpc: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says oh, it will revert even just for the estimateGas call?
undefined says i wonder if that's why the remix estimates are so high too
undefined says Yup, try use this rpc I gave to you instead.
undefined says Heyo, trying to make a web3 call for a contract to mainnet and getting an odd timeout error every so often. The code was working for me all week and now has had this issue, not sure if its arbitrum related but any help would be appreciated.
undefined says oh, these numbers are much more believable! I guess I'm just realizing that the from address is important here, that's definitely news to me
undefined says Congrats！
undefined says thanks so much for your help and patience, I hope i'm much closer to getting this over the finish line now
undefined says Happy to help
undefined says You can change another rpc to try this.
undefined says Will decentralizing the sequencer reduce throughput?
undefined says Btw you can use three apostrophes to format code
```
// like so
func () -> uint { 0 }
```
undefined says 
undefined says I think it should have no effect.
undefined says Hi everyone! Hope you are doing great! 😄 (I hope to be in the right channel)

I’m currently involved in an academic research project (actually my first one, in the field of Software Engineering) covering the so called “3rd Generation Blockchains” with the aim of defining a general framework for the evaluation of these technologies with regards to security, scalability and decentralization. 

After a long brainstorming phase with my Research Supervisor, we’ve chosen Arbitrum to represent the category of “Optimistic Rollups”.

I’m trying to retrieve as much data as I can, but I’m having a bit of problems in finding out information about sequencers and aggregators. Here’s my problem: is there a way to retrieve data (via APIs or other resources) of available sequencer(s) and aggregator(s) and the associated transactions volumes? Also, it’s not clear to me how many of these nodes are actually there.

Any information or advice would be really useful.
Thank you in advance.
undefined says Hi, the sequencer currently run by offchainlabs, aggregator is another node type, anyone can be aggregator. However, we don’t have such a tool to see how many aggregators or fullnode on this network.
undefined says had some incredibly weird stuff going on just now -- `go install ./cmd/arb-node` results in a faulty binary in `~/go/bin/arb-node` that would cause a sigsegv on any normal start
undefined says `go run ./cmd/arb-node` -- no issues
undefined says and the weirdest of all -- `go build ./cmd/arb-node` produces a binary that works just fine
undefined says so yeah i guess i'll just leave it here, in case anyone else runs into the same issue next time
undefined says (`go install ./cmd/arb-node` produces a binary that works just fine on another computer, and as far as i can tell they're both using the same rocksdb and go versions, etc)
undefined says interesting I actually hit this exact bug earlier, thought my box is corrupted and didn't investigate, ty for flagging
undefined says Oh I see, thank you for the kind reply. So, just for the sake of knowledge, the fact that there's no such tool is because of a technical limitation or just because you are not interested in developing it?
undefined says you can sort of identify aggregator if they posted batch to the delayed inbox on L1
there are no way to count aggregator/relayer node otherwise since they are not part of the consensus
undefined says Yeah I was thinking about that option, thank you very much.
undefined says Hi, I'm running a full node per https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node. However, when I send a transaction to it, I receive an error message "{ "code": -32603, "data":{"code": -32000, "message": "forbidden sender address" }".  This error never happens in Google. Any idea how to fix this error? Thanks a lot.
undefined says which network is your l1 node connected to and are both l1 and l2 node sync to the latest block?
undefined says thanks for your answer. my full node is connected to an ethereum l1. the l1 is fully synced.my l2 full node, I'm not sure. how to check this?
undefined says the last console message is "Last checkpoint gas used: 96539135203, L1 block: 12795246, L2 block: 86925"
undefined says looks like your L2 node is behind
you can lookup the latest block in https://arbiscan.io/
and compare it to the `eth_getBlock` from your l2 rpc
undefined says I see, maybe it takes longer to sync my L2 full node than expected.  I'll wait then. how of curiosity, what's the required disk space for an arbitrum full node? can it work in some kind of "pruned" mode? thanks.
undefined says by default it is pruned, it require ~120gb right now and ~20gb per month
undefined says ok, thanks a lot.
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs , I'm a dev building on Arbitrum, I DM'd you about some weird gas consumption and `ExecutionRanOutOfGas` errors I'm seeing. Looking through chat history seemed like you were the right person. Would be super super grateful if you could help or direct me to the right person who could 🙏
undefined says Got it
undefined says question - When a fraud proof is validated and the batch is rolled back containing an invalid state transition what happens to the batches published after it with ttransactions
like if batch #119 is declared invalid cause of a bad tx what happens to my totally legit transaction in batch #120, does that get rolled back too?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says The content in this link can help you
undefined says Ty
undefined says Hi, once your tx was recorded to l1, your tx won’t be rolled back if you run a own honesty node or the node you trust is honest. This is because every node can read the l1’s inbox and get tx calldata of l2, then re-compute it and get the latest state, you don’t need to trust the validators, you can just trust your honesty node’s state, that’s ok. If validators is challenged and lose the fraud proof, it only affect this validator’s state.
undefined says Do validators not communicate to establish consensus then among them all
undefined says Or is it like there can be different groups of nodes all establishing their own consensus in various "committee-like" groups
undefined says I guess I'm trying to figure out how they manage to handle producing blocks quickly enough while also establishing consensus and prevention of state growth to unmanageable levels
undefined says Like what exactly makes arbitrum much more scalable than l1 nodes
undefined says https://medium.com/offchainlabs/fraud-proofs-and-validators-how-you-or-anyone-can-keep-arbitrum-honest-d68add3f6c5d
undefined says For information on validator consensus, see the article above.
undefined says Sounds like it's just saying validators still transmit blocks to each other like on l1 to establish consensus of the state like normal
undefined says But because unlike l1 where there's slots and selection of random validators it's easy to just process transactions fast and optimistically and start transmitting whenever to other validators
undefined says Validators submit block directly to l1, here is how to submit a new rollup block(also called node): https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L525
undefined says Sure but like confirmations times rn are like 2 seconds clearly they're not submitting transactions to l1 every 3 second. I guess it's that a batch contains transactions from multiple different sequential blocks?
undefined says Hi
undefined says Quick question
undefined says Can I bridge from Arbitrum to Ethereum, but use a different address then the one I'm using?
undefined says The blocks you see from arbiscan is not rollups block, it’s sequencer block, this type blocks are generated by sequencer.
undefined says Can I send tokens to another address, kinda like transferFrom,
undefined says but bridgeFrom I guess would be the anology
undefined says You can do this with our official bridge, but you can just write script to do this, we do not support this on our bridge UI, here is the contract you need to call: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbSys.sol#L27
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thanks. What's the address of that smart-contract
undefined says or is that specific for each token?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says How frequent is block.number and block.timestamp variables updated on arbitrum mainnet? On testnet we did some trials, it seems to updated about every 15 seconds.
undefined says We emitted block.number and block.timestamp from events, the block number shown by arbiscan is 10716355 while in the event the block number is emitted as 10423556. Why is this difference?
https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0x92a51b1bde96f673722dcc10308175b690a2bdc45047fa5ff3fa63ddbbfee63f
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs what's the bridge address for USDC?
undefined says you can check here https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs whats the contract for doing this with a token
undefined says `sendTxToL1`
undefined says ?
undefined says why is it `payable`?
undefined says and will the receiving address need to a transaction on L1 to receive the tokens?
undefined says If so, you need use l2GatewayRouter:    https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2GatewayRouter.sol , the address you can see here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Yup, you need send a claim tx.
undefined says As for `sendTxToL1`, I recommend you to read this docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#arbitrum-to-ethereum
undefined says I have a few questions, and would like to confirm if my understanding is correct:
1. apart from sequencer, all other nodes' state is derived by running all the txs in the inbox in the order they appear
2. sequencer gets and executes all the tx in FIFO basis and every tx is executed or rejected instantly. it has its own state, not all of these txs that sequencer executes and confirms would be on the chain yet. sequencer publishes all the txs that went directly to the sequencer periodically back to the chain
3. sequencer can execute all the txs without publishing on the chain because it has special power over ordering, it is possible for the txs to go directly on chain but they will be the "delayed" inbox, i.e. the sequencer will interleave these txs in its ordering with a delay of 10 minutes
4. nodes that we run are forwarder nodes, they forward everything they get to the sequencer.
5. do forwarder nodes relay all the requests to the sequencer to get and query the latest state? or is forwarder node always behind by the delay at which the new state root gets published on the chain?
6. currently there is only one sequencer that offchainlabs runs and the ordering is FIFO?
7. There is no p2p gossipping within arbitrum as such, everything is derived from the tx posted on l1 and current chain state
undefined says What you are saying is mostly correct except there is a feed of each transaction produced by the sequencer over websocket that non-sequencer nodes can subscribe to to. I’m not at my computer yet this morning but look for feed options on the node
undefined says So secondary nodes can stay up to date with the sequencer without waiting for it to post batches to the L1 inbox contract
undefined says i see, so does it mean that a fully sync node can actually disconnect from the l1 rpc and continue to be in sync because of the updates from the feed?
undefined says It is best to stay connected to the L1 in case you miss a message somehow or there is a reorg
undefined says When a new batch is posted to the L1 inbox the node will check that matches what it saw from the feed. If it’s different it will take the state from L1 as the truth
undefined says makes sense, so does it mean the l1 rpc isn't called all that frequently?
undefined says okay i guess its getting called at least once every batch
undefined says I don’t have the metrics handy right now. The inbox tracking component looks for events on the L1 inbox
undefined says another question i have is how much of the rpc gets proxied on forwarder nodes to the target / sequencer? is it only sendTransaction since the state is also maintained and synced locally anyway?
undefined says iirc it’s only mutating transactions
undefined says alright, thanks
undefined says We have plans around decentralizing the sequencer for some time after Nitro
undefined says so i assume all state on forwarder nodes should be the same as sequencers with whatever latency the feed introduces?
undefined says Yes
undefined says yeah i have skimmed through FSS oracle from chainlink, although i am not sure how it gets integrated, guessing the txs that sequencer is posting on the sequencer inbox would get sequenced / ordered on chain using the FSS oracle
undefined says however, the order known and controlled by the single centralized sequencer is what gives instant soft confirmations and predictable state, so how will arbitrum's state root run ahead as it does currently with periodic posting back of state roots to l1
undefined says Great questions, I’m not sure how much I can talk about yet publicly
undefined says haha, looking forward to it whenever its shipped
undefined says have there been any presentations / talks around the arbitrum architecture and how all the l1 contracts and the l2 system work together?
undefined says This docs may help you: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says Hi, running a full node won’t give incentives, but running validators will, however, we currently do not open the registration on validators.
undefined says is the feed you refer to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed ?
undefined says Feed is automatically used, you don’t have to do anything
undefined says thanks for the message. So a full node will never be incentivized? Is there any rough timeline on when validator registration will be open or what the selection process will be?
undefined says and will there be staking/collateral requirements for validators?
undefined says For the same reason that mainnet ethereum nodes are not incentivized.
Information on validators will be published when ready.
undefined says Righto
undefined says Where can i read more about L2SubTypes
```go

Transaction Hash


My address
0x7FE58A5C1d84100D217956C741eC092FB55c98F2

I transferred usdt from arb chain to ETH chain via stargate, but eventually eth chain didn't receive usdt.
Usdt shows that it ended up at this address 0xb6cfcf89a7b22988bfc96632ac2a9d6dab60d641
undefined says is it about  layerzero's issue
undefined says Sorry, don’t know how they handle the funds transfer, you may ask stargate in their discord, this may help you.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs sir, do you know if there is a computational gas limit for a single transaction?
undefined says thx
undefined says 2.5m computational gas per tx.
undefined says Hi everyone! Quick question.

Is there a way to estimate the total transaction cost between Arbitrum Rinkeby and Arbitrum One?

Basically, I'm working with a custom contract on Arb Rinkeby and trying to figure out how much a transaction will cost once deployed to Arb One (without having to deploy it)
undefined says For example:
undefined says Hi, you can use `eth_estimateGas` with your contract’s bytecode and from address.
undefined says Hmmm, unless I'm understanding this incorrectly - it doesn't seem like that would work.

An `eth_estimateGas` call returns costs on the current network. Aren't the gas prices different between Arb Rinkeby and Arb One?
undefined says If you want to get gas price, you can call `eth_gasPrice`
undefined says Okay, I understand. Thanks!
undefined says Hey everyone, does anybody know how i can accomplish random number with solidity on Arbitrum like for example Chainlinks VRF. I would just use this but it appears they don't support Arbitrum atm. Would appreciate any resources or feedback
undefined says What’s the max TPS? Some researchers are saying 4,500, others are saying 40,000
undefined says Im currently trying to accomplish cross-chain messaging to bring randomess from L1 to L2. Any engineer that has done this before can help me out with some feedback or references. Im currently reading here https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages to get familiar with cross-chain messaging but am wondering if this is the best/only way to go about randomness within smart contracts on Arbitrum? Would appreciate feedback 🙏🏽 thanks
undefined says Haven‘t heard others vrf support arbitrum, sorry about that.
undefined says tps is actually meaningless, because different transactions have different processing difficulties.  Of course, we now can limit the computational gas limit to 120k/s.
undefined says Can someone answer this question? Its kind if critical for devs. Is gas charged for SLOAD?
undefined says SLOADs are charged in Arbitrum, although not exactly in the way how evm charge
Using immutable is still cheaper in runtime, although the deployment cost can be more expensive due to the increased contract size (which is charged in both l1 and l2)
undefined says I believe that's the only only way before we get Chainlink VRF
undefined says Remember you still need to call `eth_estimateGas` again on Arb1 rpc because gas usage will change based on gas price
undefined says Given that call data seems to be the main driver of gas. Would you recommend to ignoring SLOADs and other typical EVM gas optimization?
undefined says For me, I do not care about the deployment cost.
undefined says You still need to care the storage cost, which is also a high cost in your tx.
undefined says I won't recommend you to ignore them
undefined says Hard to really know how to optimize gas without a table for storage cost in ArbGas.
undefined says Do you have any examples or articles about storage cost?
undefined says I don't think so, yet
you can check the storage cost in Advanced TxInfo of Arbiscan e.g. https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xbe4eea418f93c0a2a44e6c2b3d9c763827943f01be333eeb8de83267e32d7214#txninfo
but that's the SSTOREs cost, SLOADs are charged in L2 Computational cost
undefined says Thanks. I was not aware of that tab. What is in L2 Storage then?
undefined says SSTOREs
undefined says Ok. It seems from looking at multiple txs that L1 Calldata is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger. It seems to me storage gas cost can be neglected. What am I missing? Are you thinking about the future when calldata costs are cheaper?
undefined says Ok, my bad
undefined says L2 Storage is larger in your example.
undefined says But that's because it dos 379 SSTORES... which I assume is not very standard.
undefined says Yea I get that. Is there a block gas limit? And are transactions using the same scaled gas as EVM (21,000 base)?
undefined says We have a computational gas cost for each tx which is 2.4m arbgas. Because we don’t have a fixed block time, so you don’t need to use block gas limit to think about the tps limit. For each tx, we don’t have such a scaled gas, but each tx needs to pay l1 calldata cost and l1 fixed cost.
undefined says Thanks for the explanation. Could you explain what the L1 “fixed cost” is?
undefined says This docs will help you：https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#prices-for-l2-tx-and-l1-calldata , cost for each l2 tx here in docs is the fixed cost.
undefined says thank you ser
undefined says So if I sent a transaction to the delayed inbox at 1pm, and you send a transaction to a sequencer changing the same state/account of the contract at 2pm, how do I know that my earlier transaction (though delayed) will come before your 2pm transaction?
undefined says For example, if I take out the last $1,000 USDC available on AAVE at 1pm and it’s routed to the delayed inbox, and you try to take out the same $1,000 left on USDC pool on AAVE at 2pm…with an honest sequencer, will they read the state from their own inbox and delayed inbox when ordering TXs? Or will validators read the timestamps to then confirm the delayed transaction happened before the sequences transaction, thus reverting the 2pm TX
undefined says it will use the state when the sequence include your tx
undefined says It will change the state when the sequence includes my TX ~24 hours later?
undefined says Will the 2nd TX say “confirmed” even tho it would get rolled back when TX 1 gets confirmed 24 hours later? Plz correct me if I’m wrong
undefined says assuming sequencer does not misbehave, your l1->l2 tx won't take 24 hours, it would take a few minute for the sequencer to include
undefined says but yes your l2 tx can revert
undefined says And if the transactions are entirely on AAVE within Arbitrum?
undefined says All L2, but one gets sequenced and the other is sent to delayed inbox
undefined says l2 rpc or delayed inbox, both have to be processed by the sequencer
undefined says if your L1 delayed inbox tx get confirmed, it only mean the sequencer must include your transaction within a certain period of time, it doesn't guarantee your l2 tx will success
undefined says in case it revert, a retryable ticket will be created for for you to retry https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says Hello all! I have a question regarding the bisection protocol and the resulting one-step proof. It's not quite clear to me how presenting a single execution step proves that the VM is at a state-hash Z from a previous state-hash Y. 

Let's say I'm the challenger and I disagree with the asserted state-hash Z, because I disagree with the single execution step in question. Is there a way to verify what the single operation step is supposed to be? 

Any insights would be greatly appreciated!
undefined says If you are a challenger and disagree with asserted hash Z, and if Z has n steps of execution, the staker will post m claims of size N/m. And then they will compare each claim and continue to cut them, until find the single execution they don’t disagree. Then they will post this execution to l1, l1 will execute it and then we will know who is the winner of this challenge.
undefined says so they find the exact single step of execution that is in contention, correct? when the single-step proof is posted on-chain to be verified, I understand the single operation takes the previous state hash-Y to the asserted state-hash Z. My question is that how does anyone know if that operation is the correct operation that is supposed to occur?
undefined says if I'm a malicious asserter and I assert an incorrect state-hash Z, for my proof, I present an operation that is not the correct operation, and it would take the accepted state-hash Y to a a maliciously asserted state-hash Z. How does the smart contracts on-chain ensure that the single operation provided by the one-step proof is the correct one?
undefined says is it because at any point, the state hash includes the next operation? so that the provided op code in a single-step proof can be verified to be correct operation?
undefined says Every txn’a calldata is recorded on l1, so everyone can read it and execute in their local environment, which means every execution is public, you don’t need to worry about one step which is edited or hidden by validators.
undefined says I think I'm referring to something different? separate from the transactions that occur on chain, the validators running the arbitrum VM asserts new states in order to advance the state of the VM, correct?
undefined says When someone challenges the assertion, there's a bisection protocol that occurs, the two parties narrow down the point of contention to a single execution step of the VM. Then the asserter provides a one-step proof in order to verify their asserted state is correct. My question is how does everyone agree on what the single operation step (for the one-step proof) should be? Thanks for your help!
undefined says Others can re-execute this tx and to see if there is a difference between validators and their local state, if there is a difference, others can make a challenge to this, is this what you want?
undefined says Validators are not involved in advancing the state of the VM in L2.  The only purpose of the validators is to assert the L2 chainstate on L1. Any disputes happen on L1.  This is part of the reason why there is a delay when withdrawing from L2 to L1 using the arbitrum bridge, is to account for possible disputes.

The sequencer publishes the order of transactions, and every L2 node executes those transactions, and knows the current state of the VM.  There are no disputes in L2.  This is why third party bridges can process withdrawals fast, because they run their own nodes, so they know the current state of the L2 chain.
undefined says Yeah that makes sense, i'm referring to the process of asserting the L2 chainstate on L1.  My question is regarding the the one-step proof that is needed, if there is any dispute between any 2 parties.
undefined says both parties start with a specific transaction where they agree on the chainstate hash before the transaction, and disagree on the hash after.  The bisection happens to narrow it down such that they agree on the machine state hash before a single instruction, but disagree on the hash after.  That state is sent to L1 smart contract, which determines the correct hash
undefined says Right, I think I understand that the single instruction is used to show how the agreed upon chainstate hash-Y becomes the disagreed upon hash after. My question is why does the challenger have to agree on what that single instruction should be?
undefined says is there a way to verify what that single instruction should should be?
undefined says Each validator generates a hash at the beginning of a transaction and at the end of a transaction.  The hashes match at the beginning, but do not match at the end.  One of the validators is doing something incorrect, but the transaction is a black box.  That is why the bisection is necessary.  Each validator knows what its own execution is, but does not know what execution the other validator did to arrive at a different answer
undefined says ahh i'm so sorry i'm not articulating well. In the context of the one-step proof, a single instruction is presented by the asserter as proof. If the asserter is malicious, can they not submit a single instruction, that is the incorrect operation that will "prove" their incorrect assertion?
undefined says my question is only in the context of the proof itself, I understand how the rest of the system works. The documentation describes the process of arriving to a single instruction after the bisection protocol, this instruction along with the preconditions is supposed to prove the assertion.
undefined says This is executing the chain, there is no submitting of arbitrary instruction, just selecting a particular instruction of the chain execution
undefined says is there a method in which that enforced? it seems like every statehash includes the next instruction operation to be executed, I assume this is how the system enforces this constraint? So that the instruction submitted in the one-step proof is used to generate the hash of the previously accepted state, which verifies that the instruction is the correct operation to be checked? Is that it? I'm just not clear.
undefined says Hi, when user send a tx to sequencer, the sequencer will confirm the user’s tx immediately and generate the new state, this state generated by sequencer is what you get from the standard rpc node or arbiscan, also, user can run their own node to read l1’s information and execute them and get the latest state. And validators won’t forward the state, they just stake the state what they think is right. After validators stake a state, there is a 7 days fraud proof window, during this period, if no one challenge this state, then those tx which included in this state will be finalized, l1 needn’t execute it, it will optimistic accept this state.
undefined says Seems like the bisection protocol selects a particular execution point, which is the statehash in question. The particular execution point is different from the actual instruction that needs to be executed? I'm not clear how it selects a particular instruction that needs to be executed, when the protocol just narrows down the specific statehash from the merkel root
undefined says How should you go about getting the L2 blockhash? `blockhash(IArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber())` doesn't appear to work.
undefined says The program codepoint is part of the state, so the hash will disagree with other opcodes
undefined says Which instruction the machine is next to execute is part of the machine’s state, so you can’t lie about the next step
undefined says Checking with team, will give you answers when I have feedback.
undefined says I have updated the doc to reflect the correct behavior
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/commit/e3a645428a55d2d3088e7b597cf7fc734e63966a?short_path=8f1ddba#diff-8f1ddba1db40aa6e217360c070f1cc3bd77ccf1a7d211a4ef3a4d82819efeae0
undefined says and there are currently no way to get the L2 blockhash  
but for most purpose blockhash(block.number) should be good
undefined says There are some special features for reducing call data size (and therefore costs) for smart contract transactions on Arbitrum: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/special_features Are these going to be worthwhile after Nitro launches, or will better call data compression in Nitro make them unnecessary?
undefined says thank you Rachel! that makes sense
undefined says Good question :nodders:
undefined says these can still be worthwhile
undefined says Hey, I couldn't find any info on this so I'm asking here. How does the data availability look like on Arbitrum? I suppose there are archive nodes in place, however I would love to get some kind of confirmation on this. I'm debating whether relying on availability of logs produced in a past year from the asking point is good strategy or whether I should change my approach.
undefined says Hi, arbitrum choose Ethereum as its DA, which is if you don’t trust the data that the sequencer or others full node provide to you, you can read ethereum’s contract calldata and resume them to l2’s calldata, then you can re-execute them until you get the latest state.
undefined says Oh yeah, that makes sense. What about the data offered through the Offchain Labs public RPC endpoint? Are the nodes behind it going to offer full data since the genesis block for the time being or are you planning to change it at one point in the future?
undefined says The public RPC endpoints are not archive nodes, but there are many node providers you can use https://portal.arbitrum.io or you can run your own node https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says Huh, then I think I'm missing something here. If they are just full nodes, which means they store only the state of recent N blocks, then how was I able to query `eth_getLogs` and get log from 85th block through Offchain Labs public RPC endpoint?
undefined says Logs do not require archive nodes, just like mainnet
undefined says Are there any resources for estimating the cost of deploying contracts onto Arbitrum? I don’t have the contracts written yet but want to get an idea of the cost

undefined says Hmm I don't see that number on the explorer. For example I know that for current Arbitrum version the computational gas limit for one transaction is 2.4m or 2.5m, and I wonder if it will be increased for Nitro
undefined says up to 20m computational gas limit per tx.
undefined says wow great, thank you

undefined says ikr, wei for gas price haha
undefined says Is there a contract that emits an event when the gasPrice changes? Or some other way to subscribe to gasPrice changes?
undefined says Hi, gas price is always floating, so there is no need to subscribe the gas price changes. But if you want to know what the price is you can call this contract: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L17 , and the address table is here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses . If you want to know the gas price off chain, you can also do the same way or just call eth_gasPrice.
undefined says Ah, got it. Thanks!
undefined says Thanks for the reply. 

Do you have some numbers on the max TPS arbitrum can do now vs in the future with Danksharding and EIP 4844?
undefined says I want to run a full node. I see the node is running normally, but why is the data directory so small?

`docker run --rm -it -v /home/arbitrum/.arbitrum/mainnet:/home/arbitrum/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.3.0-d994f7d --l1.url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxx`

`arbitrum@arbitrum-1:~/.arbitrum$ du -sh *
4.0K    mainnet`
undefined says Hi, you can check your docker volume.
undefined says Lay2 has 70g data. Is the  arbitrum data stored in this place? Can I modify it to the user directory?

`root@arbitrum-1:/var/lib/docker# du -sh *
70G     overlay2`
undefined says It is currently larger than 70g, you are still syncing it. You can set it using docker settings.
undefined says Ok thanks a lot.
undefined says Hey everyone im trying to build a game on Arbitrum but need randomness. Since chainlink vrf doesn't support arbitrum yet can anyone reccommend or advise me with some resources on how i can build my own in order to use randomnesss on arbitrum? How can i build my own VRF? I found out that $MAGIC has their own built in Randomizer smart contract that provides random numbers based on a commit/reveal patter for example i request a random number pay gas then wait a couple seconds or minutes and then call the revealRandomNumber function which is free and it checks if the requestId is ready for reveal and if so then reveals the random number but im wondering if i can built my own where i can request a random number and it returns one without having to wait 
Would appreciate any feedback
undefined says Thank you very much
undefined says JasonWan I want to run a full node. I see the node is running normally, but why is the data directory so small?
undefined says gm
undefined says please send gm to #☕︱gm  channel, thank you
undefined says Hi, you can build your own random number contract, also, you can call vrf on l1 and use bridge to transfer that number to l2.
undefined says Hi, you can check your current block number, I think you are still syncing so it storage is not so large.
undefined says Yea this would be expensive but this is an option thank you.
undefined says I saw offchain labs docs section about l1 to l2 messaging and it was great 👍
undefined says is it possible for a contract on Arbitrum to read a contract's state on L1? 
similarily, can a contract on L1 read the state of a contract on Arbitrum?
undefined says L1 and l2 are actually 2 different networks, you need use cross chain tools or oracle to do this.
undefined says yeah they're separate. are there any examples of cross chain tools for reading state on L1 from arbitrum (and vice versa)?
undefined says You can find some oracle tools from this website: https://portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says You are not persisting the correct path, database is stored inside /home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet
undefined says 👋 Are there any snapshots that can be downloaded to bootstrap a node or do I need to sync from scratch? What's the recommended approach? Thanks
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/962710612469760021
undefined says I synced mine from scratch
undefined says May be best to follow the guide https://developer.arbitrum.io/docs/running_node
undefined says Hi, in the protocol implementation, one staker can only stake in one node to compete in one challenge. Why is it designed in this way? Is it to make the implementation easier?
undefined says My understanding is not the case, you can refer to the documentation for details
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#staking
undefined says goog morning
undefined says Is there an rpc endpoint that is regular http, not https?
undefined says Thank you for the resource! The docs make sense!
However, I am trying to understand how it works at the lowest level possible. So I looked at the code that how can a challenge be created `createChalleng` in `AbsRollupUserFacet`.
It says the stakers joining a challenge need to stake on the same parent.
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/afa60b9ab2f8645fb292251d74f2adb42ecde047/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/facets/RollupUser.sol#L274

Also, I search for the working Arbitrum contracts on Eth mainnet and cannot find the staking transactions
https://etherscan.io/address/0xc12ba48c781f6e392b49db2e25cd0c28cd77531a (this should be the proxy of `RollupBase`)
https://etherscan.io/address/0x00C51F63a2D906510cb2C802C0A30589bA75D942 (this should be the `AbsRollupUserFacet` that is in charge of staking management)
Should I look for them (the staking transactions) elsewhere or there is actually no staking for now?
undefined says Staking transactions should be found on the Arbitrum. For specific technical details, you can consult @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs .
undefined says Should't the staking txs be on L1 (by this I mean not in the virtual L2 contracts)? Because this is the security part of the protocol.
Thanks, I'll wait!
undefined says The root state will be published on ETHBridge. my understanding is that both assertion and staking are in Arbitrum, maybe I misunderstood. You can refer to this part of the documentation: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-ethbridge
undefined says It says the roll-up protocol should be in eth-bridge, and I also see the function implementations as well (both in the github code base and on etherscan)
undefined says Staking for a validator isn't available publicly yet if that is what you are asking
undefined says So the security assumption for Abitrum is currently PoA and you are migrating it to the real protocol in the near future, is this correct?
undefined says Offchain labs hosts the validators while Arbitrum is in beta. On full release this option will be publicly available yes.
undefined says Because interactive proofs guarantee that as long as there is an honest verifier, the result is guaranteed to be correct.
undefined says At present, although the team maintains the verification node, it is still running the interactive proof, which can still ensure the security of Arbitrum.
undefined says Yeah, I understand the protocol at least in a high level, but if the verifier role is not permission-less, it is still kinda PoA. (because I can always exclude a player if I want to)
undefined says But I believe the Arbitrum team 🙂
undefined says According to the 12th Q&A of the #🧠︱faq  channel, permissionless validation will be open soon, along with information on staking requirements.
undefined says This method is  adopted to ensure the absolute security of the decentralized solution.
undefined says Welcome to become a validator of Arbitrum in the future😁 .
undefined says Regarding the technical details, I find a problem.

Consider the case where S0 S1 S2 the correct state commitments (or say DAs)
```
S0 S1 S2
   S1'S2'
```
but all/or some verifiers move their stake to the right most leave (the node that means "S2 is correct")
According to the rule in the link (all stakers have to stake on S1), it seems S1 can not be confirmed....

undefined says Question 1:
Would it be "not recommended" if devs build their own bridge for NFT, and just register that gateway with Arbitrum routers?
I am thinking since the ARbitrum router should be pretty agnostic, simply points to the right gateway. I can just depploy my own L1 NFT contract, canonical L2 NFT contract, then my own customL1Gayteway for 721 and customL2Gateway. Then just call "setGateway" in L1GatewayRouter?

undefined says 👍
undefined says question:

I want to build a game on-chain for the holders of my NFT collection (on ethereum mainnet).

To make things cheaper I would love to deploy this on arbitrum. To play the game the user needs to prove that it owns the NFT on ethereum. Is this possible or does the user need to bridge their NFTs to arbitrum too (which is kind of a pain).
undefined says hi why did u set all proposals to 3 days... i was on holliday... so i couldnt participate on anyone :/// it isnt DAO then....
undefined says Are you talking about the vote the other day?
undefined says If yes, it doesn't affect next month's activity, don't worry!
undefined says Hey guys! Does anyone know how to generate the txID from within a smart contract for retrying failed L2 tickets? 

`Inbox` mentions `keccak256(requestID, uint(0)` but the args need to be encoded before hashing them, and adding `encode` nor `encodePacked` produces a valid txID.
undefined says 
undefined says Anyone know if you can withdraw to Arbitrum on FTX.us or Binance.us?
undefined says Yes you can on both exchanges.  I use the global versions though. Binance supports only from 0.1 eth
undefined says Thank you. There may be a problem with my node. I'm looking for the reason
undefined says Hi, you can write a contract on l1 which used to prove one address have such a nft, and then create retryable ticket to your l2’s contract, this would work, but you need to wait about 10 minutes. Here is an example: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter.
undefined says Would you know this one by any chance @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs ? 😅
undefined says I know there’s a helper method in the sdk for that but I need to do it using a sc
undefined says I've got a question regarding the communication system between L1 & L2 (arbitrum). is it necessary to verify the messages coming from L1, from within L2? What I mean by that is that L2 outputs are verified on L1, so is there a similar process that needs to occur the opposite direction.

 Or would this not be important as all finality occurs on L1 anyways, so the correct L1 messages are always verified on the settlement layer.
undefined says Hi, you can calculate this by keccak256(keccak256(ArbchainId, inbox-sequence-number), uint(0) ), however, it’s not so easy to get inbox-sequence-number on l2, so I recommend you do this use your scripts by arb-sdk.
undefined says Hi, after users send a l1-to-l2 tx, arbitrum network will read the logs on l1 and create retryable ticket, you can read more here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#ethereum-to-arbitrum-retryable-tickets
undefined says how long the withdrawal from arbitrum's testnet to rinkeby takes?

undefined says Once an Arbitrum chain state has been finalized and committed onto L1, is there a way to retrieve the information from an Eth block?

What I mean is, if we know the block number that a chain's state has been committed to, can we get back the chain state (hash/messages/app state) by decoding the information from within the block?
undefined says You should use abi interface to encode them first. This is just an example.
undefined says please refer to :https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-ethbridge
undefined says is there a mechanism for dealing with finalized blocks that are invalid? this would not happen in practice as the challenge period would give sufficient time for honest validators to challenge invalid assertions, but in the case that an invalid block got through.
undefined says is there a method to deal with rolling back previous blocks?
undefined says Even if we rollback L2 state we cannot rollback L1 (e.g. withdrawal)
undefined says I restart node with snapshot. After an hour, there was no new logs  output. Is this normal?

undefined says It still doesn't produce a valid txId. 

`keccak256(abi.encodePacked(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(uint(421611), inboxNum_)), uint(0)));` 

I tried with `encode` as well, using mainnet and testnet chainIds, but it's the same result
undefined says And I'm getting the inbox seq num as the return value from `createRetryableTicket` which works without issues
undefined says I'm deliberately failing the L2 ticket by submitting it with a low `maxGas` so I can manually redeem it afterwards

When I let the ticket run with enough gas, it auto-redeems without issues, so the problem is not in the inbox seq num I'm passing to `keccak256`
undefined says Sorry for the back-to-back guys. 

Is there another technically possible reason why an L2 ticket auto-redeem would be fail that's not related to gas and that's not detailed here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#retryable-transaction-lifecycle ?
undefined says That section covers other reasons like L2 acc balance, addresses, bytes data, etc.
undefined says 1. gas price 2. gas limit 3. acct balance 4. l2 tx revert
undefined says I supposed these are possible options, correct? If so, what do you mean by the 4th one: l2 tx revert?
undefined says Why would the l2 tx revert?
undefined says same answer as why would any tx revert
undefined says Execution. Perfect!
undefined says the link you sent should have covered it all
undefined says Awesome. Thanks for the answer, Gzeon
undefined says whats the purpose of rolling back L2 state without rolling back L1 state?
undefined says We cannot rollback L1, so it doesn't make sense for us to rollback confirmed L2 states
undefined says Hello,I have an question, if the confirm block and reject block has the same predecessor confirmed block, they have same block number or different block numbers?
undefined says Hi, for rollups block, they have different block number, this number is recorded on smart contract and increased automatically, so you don’t need to care about if there exists the same rollups block number.
undefined says But in ethereum, they have same block number, how can I get the answer?Because I didn't see it in white paper
undefined says Hi guys, is there statistics about what is the block size of Arbitrum, Optimism?
undefined says Ethereum is layer1. For l2 the rollups block is recorded on l1.
undefined says In Ethereum, they reject block and confirmed Block has the same block number, Arbitrum has the same mechanism as Eth?
undefined says Is there any example or the answer for the block number confirmed and rejected has the same predecessor confirmed block?
undefined says Not the difference for Layer1 or layer2,only say Arbitrum, if the lastest block number is 91,the confiremd block and reject block has the same parent is 92 and 93 , or is all 92?
undefined says Arbitrum one has two types of block, one is sequencer block, another is rollups block. The sequencer block is what you see on arbiscan, currently only sequencer propose the sequencer block, So there will be no conflicting blocks. But for rollups block, this is recorded in l1 smart contract’s state, and when new block proposed, the block number will increase automatically.
undefined says If you mean rollups block, it will be 92 and 93.
undefined says I mean blocks in Arbscan
undefined says Hi, rather than block size, you can see the tx execution gas limit on l2, currently for arbitrum one is 120k per second.
undefined says The blocks on arbiscan is proposed by sequencer, and there is only one sequencer on this network, so there will not be conflicting blocks. Also, if it does conflict, it will be all 92.
undefined says Ok, what is sequencer block record?
undefined says Tx information.
undefined says So the Arbscan only record the block who run in sequence mode?
undefined says Arbiscan is designed for arbitrum one network and arbitrum rinkeby network. Those two are sequencer mode.
undefined says Ok，so arbitrum one has no option to close the sequencer?
undefined says You can learn more about sequencer mode here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#sequencer-mode
undefined says Yeah, I have read the doc, but find no answer for this question?
undefined says Arbitrum one can still keep running without sequencer.
undefined says So you mean Arbitrum one can run without sequencer, but arbscan only record sequencer mode, that means there will be some data in arbitrum one not record in arbscan?
undefined says Nope, arbiscan has it own full node to read the network data. When sequencer downs, they can still read it directly on l1.
undefined says Sequencer mode is a plus choice that can give users a instant confirmation.
undefined says Yeah,but I wonder to know what is difference between the sequence block and rollup block, the sequence block is generated by node on sequence mode, and rollup block are all in blocks generated in Arb? And Arbscan record rollup block and sequencer block for Arbitrum one?
undefined says The sequencer block is generated only by sequencer, not the others node on sequencer mode. The rollups block is proposed by validators, they propose this to stake the state which they think is right. The rollups block you can see them on l1’s contract state.
undefined says You can see rollups block(also called rollups node) here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xC12BA48c781F6e392B49Db2E25Cd0c28cD77531A#readProxyContract
undefined says Thanks for you reply, so the Arbscan is only the sequence blocks of Arbitrum one and rinkeby?
undefined says Yup.
undefined says Good job, thanks for you help
undefined says Happy to hep
undefined says hi there, is there a timeout limit when bridging from arbitrum to etherum for claiming the tx?
undefined says No time limit.
undefined says so no chance to revert a bridge tx if its already claimable on ethereum? ^^
undefined says Nope.
undefined says aight thanks:)
undefined says Anything on this? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Are Arbitrum validators backed by ETH? Is that what you put "at stake"?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says Hi, the sequence-number need you to bitflip it. Which can be done by https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/c1f257d444cf9ec42366bd44f2fdbd46e4e4ec7f/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L141
undefined says Are there changes being made to the infrastructure today?
undefined says This is typescript. Is there a way to get the txId to be used in the precompile on Solidity?
undefined says You can re-code them to solidity. Also, because you need let the l2’s contract know what the sequence number is, this is also a call to l2 contract. So I recommend you do this off chain directly.
undefined says What changes?
undefined says Sorry. Was something on my end acting up
undefined says Hi, does anyone know if it is possible to send a batch of transactions at the same time, so that they'll be included in blocks one by one without other transactions get included between mine transactions
undefined says Hi,I don’t think it is possible, for ethereum mainnet, the tx order does not depend on first come first serve, but depends on the gas price and other things. For arbitrum, although for now we use fcfs, you can't guarantee that the sequencer will not insert other people's messages when it accepts your batch txs .
undefined says Got it, thanks a lot! On ethereum you can make use of flashbots to achieve that, so I was just wondering if there is something similar on Arbitrum
undefined says Currently only sequencer has the power to order the tx, don’t think if there is another way.
undefined says You should be able to actually. Json rpc supports batch sends
undefined says Just send an array of transactions and they should be included in order without gaps if sent as a json array as arbitrum is fifo
undefined says Looking at the source of the arbitrum code, it adds a lock when receiving transactions until finished processing which prevents other transactions from processing
undefined says So is MEV possible on arb
undefined says The sequencer is fifo and therefore doesn’t prioritize based on fees
undefined says Is the only way to get testnet ETH on arbitrum testnet is to get eth on rinkeby then bridge to arbitrum testnet?
undefined says Yes, this is a method, you can also get it through other test coins on Rinkeby by swap on dex such as uniswap.
undefined says try this faucet：https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/
undefined says Sometimes the Paradigm faucet doesn't have enough or runs out. Feel free to DM if you need more.
undefined says Hi, anyone has a link for the hardware requirements of running a node?
undefined says Question:

I understand that rollup transactions are secured by L1. What if I deploy a smart contract on Arbitrum that communicates with another contract on Arbitrum (L2 to L2), will that also be secured by L1 or only transactions that are L1 to L2 or L2 to L1?
undefined says If a dapp never needs to deposit from L1 or withdraw to L1, and lives entirely on Arbitrum, does that mean that in-essence it just uses Arbitrum as a sidechain? Or is all of the dapp's transactions still secured on L1 via rollup?
undefined says Arbitrum is a strict state function of its L1 inbox. `L2 => L2` messages must be generated deterministically from an L1 inbox item. Hence, all activity happening on Arbitrum is secured by L1, which puts Arbitrum in another class fully distinct from alt L1's and sidechains
undefined says For AWS, we recommend z1d.2xlarge.
undefined says Any idea how much overhead is added to the L1 node by the L2 node? Assuming they are running on different machines?
undefined says hello
undefined says Aggregator is a stand in term of sequencer, correct?
undefined says Concerning arbitrum nitro docs
undefined says The sequencer is an aggregator but not all aggregators are sequencers
undefined says Here are the batches added to l1, you can see it here: https://arbiscan.io/batches .
undefined says Hello, can the Arbitrum sequencer potentially add transactions to the inbox? Or can it only reorder them.
E.g. is it possible to insert tx that updates the state of a contract (e.g. increment epoch) without any gas?
undefined says The sequencer can't sign txes on your behalf since it would need to know your private key, just as a miner on L1 can't forge activity that you never signed
undefined says ty. I was wondering if a DAO could operate a node, and have it sign txes for the DAO (node has the private key) that automate the DAO's contracts (e.g. run keepers for the DAO in a way that doesn't cost much gas)
undefined says The DAO could submit transactions to the sequencer's inbox or aggregate transactions themselves through the delayed inbox
undefined says Just depends on what they're trying to do but in principle well designed smart contracts can be called by L2 users / DAO operators
undefined says ahh ok interesting, ty. We have some game functions that we would like to automate (like a cronjob) instead of relying on L2 users to nudge the contract state and was thinking through whether running a node could solve that issue in a cost-effective way
undefined says You could perhaps have the cronjob submit txes at regular intervals
undefined says Just depends on what you're trying to achieve & the specifics of your stuff obv 🙂
undefined says is it possible to find out how the feeStats are calculated?
undefined says Also wondering if a nice diagram exists where it shows how the L2 interacts with the L1 contracts ( e.g with Inbox.sol, Rollup.sol, Challenge.sol etc) or anything in general. Cheers 🙂
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says Say there was an airdrop and I just used Arbitrum for the first time today. Hypothetically, would I be eligible? Lol
undefined says We haven’t issued token, so no airdrop.
undefined says Hi everyone! I'm currently involved in a research project and I'm trying to gather some information. I came across this article https://www.nansen.ai/research/arbitrum-the-future-of-blockchain-scaling in which they state "In terms of processing capacity, Arbitrum should allow for **40,000 TPS**". Can you tell how and where this value was calculated/retrieved?
undefined says If you have a full node, and you get a bunch of txs ready to submit in a batch, it goes through the delayed inbox?
undefined says Hi, TPS is meaningless since particular transactions vary drastically in complexity.Also, this number was calculated by if the max capacity of ethereum is filled by the rollups tx and no other l1 tx.
undefined says Hi, only sequencer can send batch tx to sequencer inbox, others can only send tx to delayed inbox.
undefined says Full nodes just forward transactions to sequencer
undefined says How do i participate in arbitrum dao voting if any
undefined says no voting now
undefined says What is the main difference btw Arbitrum and Optimism?
undefined says Arbitrum and optimism have the different fraud proof way, and their fraud proof way: cannon hasn’t released to the mainnet yet.
undefined says which is a good cloud provider that can run arbitrum node? i haven't had success with digitalocean or vultr seems even their nvme is too slow.
undefined says We use z1d of aws, but it just a recommendation.
undefined says how about storage? i dont think compute is the problem
undefined says Z1d.2xlarge minimum, put database on NVMe
undefined says Thank you and sorry for my late response. Do you have any resource to look at to get some data about blocks and transactions size? I mean how they can vary, under which conditions, and so on. Thank you in advance, my research project is highly data-driven.
undefined says give me a sec.
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/chart/tx@Tregon
undefined says Thank you, I already came across arbiscan. Unfortunately the chart is always displaying  "Avg block size: 0". I don't know if it's an error
undefined says emmm.Idk 
maybe admin can answer this
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbos_formats#block-summary
undefined says ArbOS and the sequencer determine when a block begins and ends
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says Hi! I'm here once again to ask you about a doubt I came across studying your protocol. As far as I understood, both aggregators and the sequencer batch transactions into a single message. The difference is that the former sends the message to the delayed inbox, while the sequencer sends the messages to the sequencer inbox. In this article https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec is stated that

> If the sequencer node stops adding transactions to the sequencer inbox, anyone can force the sequencer inbox to include transactions from the delayed inbox via a smart contract function call. This allows the Arbitrum network to always be available and resistant to a malicious sequencer.

Is this the only reason why there are two different smart contracts for doing basically the same thing? And if so, how Arbitrum is resistant to a malicious sequencer thanks to this forwarding of messages? Thank you in advance for your patience.
undefined says 1.Hi, those 2 smart contracts both used to record the l2 user’s tx, but the sequencer inbox can only used by sequencer, while another one can be used by everyone, users can use delayed inbox to send their l2 tx directly if the sequencer is down or user doesn’t trust sequencer, so yes, this is the main reason for them to do the same thing. 2. Currently, the sequencer follows first come first serve, so it won’t cheat by change the order.
undefined says Ok I get it, thank you!
undefined says You can see more information here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says Quick question guys: `inbox.sendL2Message(bytes messageData)` is another way of sending an L1-to-L2 tx, but how do you get it in L2 since the only param is bytes with no destAddr?
undefined says Sweet! Thanks, Jason
undefined says Last question: do you have any documentation on when `sendL1FundedUnsignedTransaction`, `sendL1FundedContractTransaction`, `sendUnsignedTransaction`, `sendContractTransaction` are used? Or any examples on a repo?
undefined says All I found was this page with just the function signatures: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-eth/bridge/inbox
undefined says `uint256(uint160(bytes20(destAddr)))` whats with this casting?
undefined says particularly the downward and then upward cast?
undefined says just chopping excess bits off?
undefined says For different type of those function, it has different message types, you can see the codes here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol , it has the message type on it. For messageData, it varies from different messages type, you can see the format here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbos_formats#incoming-messages , the messageData I gave you is retryable ticket type, but the function you mentioned is l2_tx type, my bad, misread. You should refer to this document.
undefined says For bytes20 cast, it will return the first 20 bytes’ data.
undefined says right, I understand, I guess the thing Im questioning is getting the first 20 bytes, followed by getting the first 160 bits (cast to some uint), then getting the first 256 bits (effectively chopping your output and resizing for the next call)
undefined says so why go 20 bytes -> 160 bits -> 256 bits
undefined says seems like you can just go 160 bits -> 256 bits without the other jump
undefined says Well, good point, I will ask the team and give you a feedback.
undefined says This doc doesn't show though how to encode messageData on `sendL2Message`
undefined says I'm asking since you mentioned that the encoding you wrote before was for retryable tickets and this one is not
undefined says Or if destAddr is encoded in messageData
undefined says This function will send l2-msg type's transaction, which should can be those type: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbos_formats#l2-messages , you can see, they include destAddr if it is needed.
undefined says Yep, saw it. Thanks
undefined says How does the bridge wait period work exactly? I've observed that withdrawn funds usually become claimable before the ETA. Normally at least a few hours before.
undefined says I've observed 5000 blocks left and then checked back an hour later and it is claimable.
undefined says hello, to be a validator is that just for staking as part of strategy for fraud proofing?
undefined says this should help you.
https://medium.com/offchainlabs/fraud-proofs-and-validators-how-you-or-anyone-can-keep-arbitrum-honest-d68add3f6c5d
undefined says It needs past a deadline target block number, you can see the block number check here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/Node.sol#L137
undefined says Validator can stake a new rollups block(node) and also challenge others node if it think others are wrong.
undefined says Hello! Is there any website that shows arbitrum's average block rate?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/blocks
undefined says Hi Jason! I went through this part but it still doesn't explain what the encoding is for the L2 message. All that it mentions is (if the L2 messageData I want to use is subtype 1):
undefined says So what would be the encoding of a subtype 1 tx for obtaining the messageData for calling:
undefined says Or do you have any working examples on a repo?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I am having a weird error where when submitting txs to a contract deployed on testnet, block.number is returning block numbers from around a month ago. the actual tx's are being run on the current blocks, but in this contract i store the block.number value in the contract for later and the block numbers are from blocks around a month ago
undefined says any idea why that could happen??
undefined says Could you provide specific examples?
undefined says yes so i just ran this tx
undefined says https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0xf0f6685167ec13fcf5ac47a576a68fe93e48c69bc21b9d19d98ed21e631a9963
undefined says but then when i fetch the info that is stored in this transaction
undefined says the blockheight is all blocks of a month ago
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs
undefined says Submit a ticket support.arbitrum.io
undefined says how long does it usually take
undefined says hello, another question- what is the process at the moment to become a validator for arbitrum? are they openly being taken in at this time?
undefined says Any idea @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Any thoughts on my idea for how to bridge low liquidity fungible tokens would are welcome 🙂 ! https://research.arbitrum.io/t/fast-withdrawals-for-low-liquidity-fungible-tokens/51
undefined says Arbitrum currently do not open the registration on validators.
Permissionless validation will be open soon, along with information on staking requirements.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Can you tell me what is the zone your AWS node resides in? Such as us-east-1a. I want to lower the latency.
undefined says The transaction signature can be viewed here
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker
undefined says Any feedback on this, guys? 🙂
undefined says Hi,
I am wondering how the ordering of TX is made the sequencer ? 
It is related to the time at which the sequencer receive the tx ? What is the gas price paid ?
undefined says what is the story about The Arbitrum Odyssey ? you earn Nft by doing tasks?
undefined says https://medium.com/offchainlabs/the-arbitrum-odyssey-87d6e11171d5
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/962ab51cffff5d57daee0f4b031d69a3224d51d4/arb_os/inbox.mini#L443
undefined says The sequencer is not a validator
undefined says Oh I see where you're confused. Do you know what ArbOS is?
undefined says Yeah pretty much. ArbOS is the EVM hypervisor -- it's the program validators do their proofs over. It's written in mini, a special programming language that compiles down to AVM bytecode. The sequencer also loads this program but in non-proving mode when it takes user txes. So if ArbOS says your tx is invalid, the sequencer knows that
undefined says ArbOS rejects it
undefined says There's no need for a challenge -- ArbOS's instructions say what to do in that case and that's to throw out the tx at the sequencer's detriment
undefined says If the sequencer then goes "actually, ArbOS said this is valid" *then* a challenge could happen because ArbOS didn't actually say to accept the tx
undefined says If the sequencer runs a modified ArbOS, it'll come to results validators don't
undefined says Or if the sequencer lies about what ArbOS says, it'll still come to wrong results
undefined says ArbOS makes progress through messages coming from the L1 inbox. That, and only that, determines its state
undefined says So if there's something to contest, it's what happens when a given L1 inbox entry is fed through ArbOS. There's not really a place for the sequencer to confuse validators here
undefined says They'll run the tx through ArbOS, see where they disagree, and submit a fraud proof
undefined says Let's figure out where we're confused. What scenario are you imagining exactly?
undefined says What has the sequencer done in this scenario?
undefined says I’m trying to make sure we’re talking about the same thing
undefined says So in that case no fraud has happened
undefined says ArbOS will process and reject the tx
undefined says The sequencer and validators move on to the next L1 input
undefined says The sequencer (or anyone, for that matter) can submit an invalid tx. ArbOS processes it like anything else in the inbox, and according to its programming the thing to do is to throw out the tx
undefined says Yeah
undefined says ArbOS is, in a way, the protocol
undefined says Well, a major component of it
undefined says Now think about this. If the sequencer actually tried that, it’d lose money. ArbOS only accepts things from the L1 inbox, so that’d mean the sequencer would have to uselessly pay L1 costs posting the invalid tx
undefined says Layer 2 works a lot differently than an alt L1. We’ve got a different set of primatives to work with — namely the ability to 1-of-n contest the state of a machine
undefined says The sequencer is not a validator so it doesn't issue an assertion. But assuming it coordinated with a validator to do what you're saying what would happen is the fraud proof would disagree on how far progress had been made through the inbox. ArbOS has a `readInbox` opcode btw
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification
undefined says `inbox` is the opcode actually funny enough ArbOS's source never complies down to include an `inboxpeek`, but my point is if you're trying to lie about which tx you're on, you're gonna need to lie about the state after this opcode
undefined says Everything that's happening to the state happens in ArbOS. This means if a validator wants to lie it's going to need to argue ArbOS did something it didn't & that means deviating from what ArbOS actually says to do
undefined says So the honest party submits a fraud proof showing where exactly the liar deviated from ArbOS's execution history
undefined says Cause at some point the liar necessarily has to take a different opcode or lie about the output of a correct one
undefined says They'll agree up to a point, but there's going to be an exact first moment where the liar lies and that's where the honest party defeats them. What this means is you can look through ArbOS's soruce and be confident that what it says to do actually happens in L2 & is provable to L1
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/arch/OneStepProof.sol
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/arbos/Geth.md#arbitrumunsignedtx when would this be a desirable property to have?
undefined says Im sure a use case was in mind while adding this kind of transaction
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/arbos/Precompiles.md#arbaddresstable
:thinkies:  theres no way to remove an address from an address table; Im assuming this is only used internally so idk if its ever called for to remove addresses from the table; but interesting the functionality isnt offered
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/proving/ChallengeManager.md
```
A challenge begins with only two segments (a degree of one), which is the asserter's initial assertion. Then, the bisection game begins on the challenger's turn. In each round of the game, the current responder must choose an adjacent pair of segments to challenge. By doing so, they are disputing their opponent's claim that starting with the first segment and executing for the specified distance (number of steps) will result in the second segment. At this point the two parties agree on the correctness of the first segment but disagree about the correctness of the second segment. The responder must provide a bisection with a start segment equal to the first segment, but an end segment different from the second segment. In doing so, they break the challenge down into smaller distances, and it becomes their opponent's turn. Each bisection must have degree min(40, numStepsInChallengedSegment), ensuring the challenge makes progress.
```
in this paragraph breaking down the challenge process, it seems to imply that the responder my arbitrarily slice the bisection into another bisection (I think the final statement in the paragraph touches on minimum requirements on slicing). why not just force everyone to provide a proof of the middle of some bisection each time?
undefined says IE: given you have some bisection at operations 80 to 160 (idk the term best for this); it seems a user could choose to respond with a proof at operation 90 or 85 (just somewhere far from slicing the thing in a meaningful way), which can be used for stalling
undefined says if you forced people to select the center of a bisection every time, then you would know for sure it would take log(O) to reach the thing youre disputing right?
undefined says I guess I dont see the reason to provide challengers with a choice on where to slice the segment
undefined says || https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-real-dissection-protocol I found an explanation nvm the last question. ||
undefined says Others use it, but why would you want to remove a shorthand you paid for?
undefined says I was just questioning why it wasnt offered, but this probably has more to do with immutability for merkle trees
undefined says after asking that, I read more about how arbstate is dealt with and compressed, since iirc arbstate is encoded with a hash into some of the block information when its proposed
undefined says so I imagine it'd be a pain to calculate the hash of some trie if someone keeps removing elements and the whole thing needs to be rebalanced / recalculated because of it
undefined says so I just accepted it was for efficiency reasons
undefined says my current confusion is how the inbox is consumed by an arbitrum validator, my question in particular is, how do you prevent someone from consuming a message from the l1 inbox and not acting on it? (my assumption is a challenge can address this, but idk how the challenge would look since youre challenging a transaction that never occured?)
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs youre the challenge / prover guy so Im sure you have some opinion on this :^)
undefined says my reason would be, its no longer valid / needed (for some extenuating reason we can pretend is valid for this)
undefined says I believe you are talking about sequencer censoring a txn. There is a slow inbox on L1 and users can directly post txn to it to avoid censorship https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says its alittle different I think, since this is a validator whos popped a transaction from the mailbox but chose not to complete the transaction to forward to the sequencer
undefined says so my understanding is that when a validator takes some txn from the inbox to think about and propose a block; the sequencer I think eventually gets to confirming a transaction after a proposed block has been around for long enough
undefined says so the thing Im suggesting is that a validator pops a transaction, but never proposes a new block after doing so
undefined says I'm not official, nor fully understand the protocol, and here is my guess. Active validators propose rollup blocks by interacting with a L1 contract, in which they are required to respect the txn order in the inbox. So if one validator hide some txns, the order is then broken, which the multi-section challenge protocol will catch this. Only when a rollup block is confirmed, the txns it consumes can be safely pruned from the inbox. Before any txn is included in a confirmed rollup block, it should not be consumed from the inbox
undefined says arbitrum has some mind bending interactions happening for sure, it can definitely result in a challenge, since youre allowed to also challenge transactions that you know cant be run I think, such as something that would take too much gas to complete
undefined says but yeah, popping elements from the inbox is probably impossible without proposing a block, as youre suggesting
undefined says Actually I'm here to ask another question lol. I saw Arbitrum will compress calldata that posted on L1, but how do you deal with the case when verifying a one step proof actually needs some info from the calldata, for example a opcode that access the timestamp/blocknumber/sender/some chunk of input data/etc.? Do you require the prover to send uncompressed data then when needed or this will never happen?
undefined says And btw, do you guys have any statistics on one step proof size and verification gas cost for Arbitrum Nitro? I'm very curious, especially when comparing to Arbitrum One
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#codepoints-optimizing-code-for-proving Im sure youve already read this so you know about the codepoint stuff; Lee talked about 'preimaging' hashes a few times
undefined says so the trick is probably that they can look at the hash and determine information about it as a special case
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/proving/OSPAssumptions.md
undefined says I'm talking about https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#compressing-transactions and https://research.arbitrum.io/t/compression-in-nitro/20 actually. Although yes it can be solved like posting a hash of original data along with the compressed data, and when one step proof is needed validator post the original data aligning the hash. I just want to confirm how Arbitrum actually does it
undefined says hello, I have question. why arbitrum txn fees are kinda 'higher' than optimism?
undefined says Hey guys. Can anyone tell me how I can utilize chain link oracle in my smart contract. I have not deployed to arbitrum yet and I don't exactly know what's different versus eth mainnet.
undefined says You can use these addresses if you want price feeds: https://docs.chain.link/docs/arbitrum-price-feeds/
undefined says As far as I know, the deployment shouldn't be much different than deployment on Mainnet.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/contract_deployment
undefined says Thanks. I want to use it as a source of randomness.
undefined says CL hasn't deployed VRF on Arbitrum yet. I know many are anxiously waiting for it!
undefined says That was my gut feeling as well. I just entered arbitrum discord so I thought I ask you guys for some tips. Thanks
undefined says Does arbitrum emit `newHeads` events at some abnormal rate? I am trying to run down an issue we are having with Alchemy and newHeads subscriptions for websockets
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L614 talking about this?
undefined says Hi, yes, we support this subscribe.
undefined says There is no fixed rate of blocks
undefined says we have different gas pricing formula and as Arbitrum try to smooth out gas spike in L1 we can be slightly more expensive when L1 gas price is low
undefined says Thanks @Long Range Comms (will NEVER dm) , but I am asking if on each new block emits a "newHeads" event. We recently moved over to Alchemy and they are claiming that our backend is creating millions on "newHeads" websocket subscriptions. My theory is that we had some vestigial code that connected the provider to the 'block' event, which we are NOT using because Arbitrum spits too many blocks, but if each block emits a "newHeads" event, then perhaps this is what was happening?? Does anyone have experience with this? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs
undefined says yeah; so arbitrum internally doesnt have a concept of mining, so new blocks and thus the new heads event is triggered _nearly_ every transaction for fast reporting
undefined says essentially, any time a block is proposed by a validator, you see a new block in arbitrum
undefined says and a block can have 1 transaction in it, in fact most of the time it will
undefined says yeah, this was my recollection...just wondering if using an infrastructure provider like Infura (which doesn't support Arbitrum websockets) or Alchemy (which does), are charging for websocket events/responses, using a connection to Arbitrum and subscribing to new blocks seems untenable.
undefined says have you considered just running an arbitrum node yourself?
undefined says thanks @Long Range Comms (will NEVER dm) for confirming that
undefined says the DB is not that large, like 200-300gbs iirc
undefined says so the requirements to run an arbitrum node are still mostly reasonable, given you have an NVME
undefined says I can, but I don't want my day to be keeping an arbitrum node up...We had no problem with Arbitrum's endpoints, I just wanted to take some pressure off of their infrastructure, and bring all our needs under one service provider
undefined says yeah Im with you, operations is a pain
undefined says an alternative, if you dont need real time reporting, is to wait for a bundle to get minted to l1
undefined says and then take those hashes from the bundle and query for those blocks
undefined says that way youre not spamming requests and can probably come up with clever ways to do some kind of batch query
undefined says true that's probably not a good idea to use `newHeads` given that our frequency of new block
undefined says I would suggestion polling instead
undefined says I am using ethers with websockets, 
For this: provider.on('block', block => {...});
I think when this happens on Arbitrum it spits out tons of "newHeads"....
I have removed this subscription, but wanted to identify the issue Alchemy claims is happening
undefined says Do you have a page that I can take a look?
undefined says 
undefined says I can understand eth_getLogs, because that's what I am subscribed to...but what is subscribing to 'newHeads'
undefined says newHeads is just part of the block subscription
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/block/11203595 if you look on arbscan you'll see that basically every block is a transaction
undefined says so newheads is giving you literally every transaction being proposed to the rollup in real time.
undefined says even arbiscan is struggling to keep up, you can kind of sense when the network is getting busy when the latest block is over a minute old (that just came in on the interface)
undefined says I am having trouble with ArbSys.arbBlockNumber() returning invalid Op CODE when run from a contrat that is under an upgradeable proxy architecture. without the proxy on top of the contract the contract and arbSys call it contains runs fine, but it cause an error when in the proxy structure. ANy idea why???

https://dashboard.tenderly.co/rahab/project/simulator/ed10b42d-e3be-42d2-a489-990fbf9095a7 here is what tnederly shows happening (you can decode the input data to address(100) to be "arbBlockNumber") when the address(100) is called. no idea how this could return invalid op code on the delegated call from the proxy to the contract to the arbSys and not just from the contract to the arbSys. @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  @gzeon | Offchain Labs @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs
undefined says Thanks @Long Range Comms (will NEVER dm) I am just a little unclear on how Alchemy charges, but what it looks like is that if "you" are subscribed to new blocks, which Arbitrum generates a ton of, you may have an expensive Alchemy bill. I am speaking with them on Friday, hopefully there is a solution, else we may be running our own node :arbjak:
undefined says Hello, is there any way to swap some ETH with 0 ETH in my wallet as gas fee?
undefined says Perhaps not, arbitrum use ethers as gas, you need use it to pay gas fee.
undefined says Hi, what invalid Op code did you get?
undefined says It doesn’t give any info just invalid op code. U can look on the tenderly link I sent to see what’s going on. As I said it only happens when I call the contract that contains the arbSys call through a proxy. Calling the contract directly without proxy works fine which is really wierd
undefined says Ok, will have it a look.
undefined says Thanks.
undefined says Appreciate it
undefined says I saw you may occurs `run out of gas`, you can use eth_estimateGas first and then call this function.
undefined says I don't think tenderly simulation on Arbitrum support precompiles yet http://blog.tenderly.co/you-can-now-use-arbitrum-on-tenderly/
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @gzeon | Offchain Labs if i gas up the tx it still fails. 
https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0x18fb27e411fa489284dcb221e527edaec1a1ff9a18b6c01d1e9e9640a4365876
https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/arbitrum-testnet/0x18fb27e411fa489284dcb221e527edaec1a1ff9a18b6c01d1e9e9640a4365876/debugger?trace=0.0

and if you actually trace it all the way out by similuating what the delgate call does to the contract under the proxy (it calls arbSys.arbBlockNumber()) it seems to be failing in calling the arbSys contract as  I said https://dashboard.tenderly.co/rahab/project/simulator/5381c841-e1ff-4c75-923c-df0364487b57
undefined says the simulation is invalid since you can't simulate call involving Arb Precompile with tenderly yet
undefined says okay regardless i just changed one line in the contract to use standard block.number instead of arbSys.arbBlockNumber() and ran it under a proxy and the call worked. so its a problem where you cant use arbBlockNumber in a delegated call from a proxy contract architecture
undefined says without knowing the contract code it is hard for me to tell why it revert
undefined says would be nice if you can send me some code that I can reproduce the issue
undefined says does that make sense. That is the issue and quite frustrating as ultimately i need to run the contract that is using the arbSys call under an upgradeable proxy architecture. not sure how this could be fixed
undefined says okay adding u as a friend!
undefined says Can't find a block gas limit, is it safe to assume that 10 million gas transaction is possible, or how should I think about it?
undefined says For single tx, we have 2.4m computational gas limit.
undefined says Isn't 2.4m under ethereums gas block limit?
undefined says I'm a novice, but I'm testing contract calls in truffle - just trying to estimate if my function that uses 2m gas will be safe on arbitrum
undefined says I should download arbitrum I guess and run a local chain to see if gas units are 1:1 with eth (or whatever truffle default is)
undefined says The gas on arbitrum has 4 part, which is l1 fixed fee, l1 calldata fee, l2 computational fee and l2 storage fee. Which you can see here: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x91ae74e399729fab425965d0a20f689ad159c6a41dd48bf96f8cce91bde39b9b
undefined says And the gas cost compare to ETH is not 1:1, because we have different calculations way.
undefined says For more details about arbitrum gas fee, I recommend you read this docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#gas-and-fees
undefined says I know the cost is way lower, but the gas units used per computation are much lower too?
undefined says The computational gas calculation is different from l1, but in total, the gas cost will be lower than l1.
undefined says Ah I see, so the gas use per instruction is different than eth
undefined says Yup
undefined says Why do the docs say there is no limit though, but you mentioned the 2.4m figure?
undefined says For security, we set this limits. Btw, we will change the gas calculation after nitro: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/838ba2193e84f54df316a5ea6b0bd3ed4d0fdb37/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#breaking-changes
undefined says 😓 I'll download arbitrum, test contracts with that to see cumulative gas used by the functions, and pray that nitro doesn't change too much I guess?
undefined says Ah, the gas calculation model will have a breaking change to make it consistent with l1, so you need prepare for that in advance.
undefined says I'm kind of confused..
undefined says truffle now tells me a function uses 100k gas (on mainnet simulation or whatever)
undefined says If I download arbitrum, I can find out the gas units used on arbitrum, but then arbitrum will switch to nitro later...
undefined says So is it safest to assume that 100k will be the gas units used approximately once nitro launches?
undefined says You can also use eth_estimateGas to estimate the gas cost.
undefined says I'm just looking at the transaction receipt's cumulativeGasUsed field
undefined says but my question was more which network do I test that number on?
undefined says This is our nitro decent: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_nitro_devnet . This is our currently arbitrum testnet: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet . Btw, before send a tx to blockchain, it’s much reliable to use eth_estimateGas rather than hard code the gas limit.
undefined says yea I'm not hardcoding a gas limit, I'm writing a contract and calling a function to test, then looking at the receipt's gas used
undefined says Thank you for the links! I will test the contract on nitro I guess
undefined says Happy to help.
undefined says Hi, Arbitrum finality is a week - a duration long enough for anyone to provide fraud proof on the given txn if it is fraudulent.  So how is it possible that the bridges are able to provide cross chain liquidity before the 7 days?  How can they be sure that the transaction is valid? thx
undefined says recently i met this problem many times , how to solve it ,anyone can help?
undefined says when i am swapping , i met this problem
undefined says Hi, there are so many ways that 3rd part bridge can use to provide the fast token bridge. First one is the bridge can make 2 pools on l1 and l2 sides, and put an oracle to community with each other, this is what normal cross chain bridge do. Another way is, when you withdraw your token from l2, the 3rd part bridge provider will get your withdraw proof and then give you token instant but charge some service fee, when the token arrive on l1 after 7 days, the token will go directly to the bridge provider’s address.
undefined says Hi, it’s ok, it won’t affect your tx.
undefined says No, the swap always failed
undefined says i dont know why
undefined says Is there any function like EVM processes the state changes in Arbitrum?
undefined says If the tx failed, it is not affected by the reason which you mentioned, maybe another reasons, you can see from arbiscan if there is any reasons that the blockchain throws.
undefined says Sorry, don’t get what you mean, but arbitrum is evm-compatible, you can use ethereum way to interact with contract’s state.
undefined says what is this mean sir?
undefined says I have to wait for 1 week???
undefined says Yes, next time you can use 3rd part bridge then you will get a fast withdraw.
undefined says This nut
undefined says Regarding nitro upgrade, do the arb nodes need to update too?
undefined says Yes you’ll want to update to the new nitro stack

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro
undefined says Ok cool, but not right now, right? As the nitro version is still devnet?
undefined says its still in _testnet_ actually
undefined says I'm trying to build arbitrum from source, and the docs say do "yarn build", but there is no build command
undefined says I do see commands like:
```
 - docker:build:ganache
      yarn workspace arb-bridge-eth docker:build:ganache
   - docker:build:geth
      yarn workspace arb-bridge-eth docker:build:geth
- run:local:geth
      yarn workspace arb-bridge-eth run:local:geth
```
undefined says I'm just trying to test my contract through truffle.
What should I be building here? 
I do have ganache installed separately
undefined says theres not an easy way to deploy the rollup locally and then deploy your contracts for testing
undefined says theres a subdirectory `contracts` which you can use yarn to run their tests, but that merely cheecks deployment of l1 contracts and teases some of the l1 logic with a bit of poking
undefined says theres a test-node.bash script which stands up a geth node and some validators and the sequencer in docker containers and exposes their rpc interfaces
undefined says if you can piece together the right contracts to call you could probably do some local testing
undefined says Ok seems like I'm going in the wrong direction there.
undefined says Im trying to test contracts, first step being install arbitrum. Had issues with docker because I'm on an older mac, and can't build from source
undefined says I did find truffle has arbitrum-box preconfigured environment, I'll check that out
undefined says Hi guys, I am trying to run arbitrum node myself, is there a snapshot I can use, rather than syncing the node from start?
undefined says Thanks.  I am not being clear.  I am not questioning how the bridges perform the transfer.  My question centers around the notion that if Arbitrum has a 7-day finality, and if the tokens for the bridge transfer has been in the source wallet for less than 7 days, then isnt there some risk, however minute, that those tokens may become invalid due to a fraud proof submitted after the transfer?  For example, suppose Alice, with the help of a malicious validator, double spent her AETH - she sent 5 AETH to Bob and also shortly after sent the same 5AETH to her L1 address.  The bridge makes the transfer by adding to the pool on L2 and remove from the pool on L1.  However, at a later time if a fraud proof is submitted for the 5AETH that never should have been in Alice's wallet, then we have a problem.  I am sure there is something I dont understand or misunderstand here.  I am not questioning that the bridges are doing something wrong.  Just trying to figure out what is incorrect with my mental model. thx
undefined says hi, at which point of the roadmap are we now? is the sequencer already decentralized? where can i check the roadmap?
undefined says Alice can’t send her L2 ETH a second time because she no longer has any L2 ETH. Withdrawals are initiated on L2 and so if her balance is empty, the tx initializing it will fail
undefined says Of course.  Thats assuming every txn is legit.  But what if not?  Isnt the purpose of the 7day finality is to allow submission of fraud proof so that a malicious txn will be voided?  And if the bridge transfers from L2 to L1 before the fraud proof is submitted, how does the bridge know that the token being sent is legit since it only sees whats being recorded on the L2 blockchain?

Thanks for answering my question.  I am sure that I am missing something here
undefined says Withdrawals are dependent on the 7 day delay. You can't actually claim your funds on L1 without having had the outbox accumulator update which requires the assertion containing your withdrawal to have succeeded all challanges
undefined says There's no such thing as a "legit" tx in this sense. There's states and there's state transitions (which txes induce) and it's up to validators to ensure the state transitions are correct. If the tx tries to double spend, it reverts like it does on L1. If one wants to lie and say it doesn't revert, that requires asserting an incorrect state that'll be challenged by those honest
undefined says Thanks for indulging my questions.  But on L1, the nodes(at least the full nodes) check for every txn being added to the block to ensure validity.  From my understanding, in Optimistic rollups thats not the case, and thats why there is a 7 day period to challenge an invalid txn by submitting a fraud proof.  So if a malicious validator decides to insert an incorrect txn, a bridge will not know and will process as if everything is valid?  Of course that does not mean that there wont be honest challengers, its just that by the time it is challenged, the bridge has already transferred the token?  

I am assuming that, to this day, there has never been a fraud proof submitted for Aribtrum or any Optimistic rollups?
undefined says The outbox contract on L1 works with states, not txes
undefined says A validator proposes a state letting you withdrawal. After the 7-day confirmation, you can claim your now-L1 ETH
undefined says No there's never been a fraud proof except in testing
undefined says So is it possible for a bridge that is transferring from Arbitrum to L1  Eth to have the transferred tokens to be part of fraud proof submitted after the transfer has finished?  and if so, what will happen then?
undefined says I don't think that question makes sense :thinkies:
undefined says Fraud proof after the transaction cleared? You're saying dispute a transaction in a block that's already passed all time locks?
undefined says And withdrawn across the bridge
undefined says Your questions are relying on a misunderstanding of how Arbitrum works. The fraud proofs are over the correctness of states generated by executing ArbOS over the messages placed in the L1 inbox.

Perhaps reading the following reference will help you find where you're confused
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says Thx.  Will give it a read.  I am sure I have a misunderstanding that needs to be cleared up
undefined says Feel free to ask if you're still confused after that. There's probably something you'll have an "aha!" moment about that'll make sense of these answers 🙂
undefined says Yes, absolutely.  Really trying to find that aha moment and thanks for your patience in answering my questions
undefined says Anytime, it's cool stuff
undefined says :sayori:
undefined says Yeah, I mean whether there is any function in source code I could see the statedb change based on Arbitrum rules? Because Ethereum has this function, the same as Arbitrum One?
undefined says I'm using truffle to run a test with "--network arbitrum_testnet"
Just realized every "truffle test" is costing me ARETH, why isn't it simulating the deployment + transactions like truffle does for mainnet eth tests?
undefined says 
undefined says did my first arbitrum deposit yesterday and lòoks good. thx folks for the product
undefined says i simulated another one on the bridge site and had both optimism and arbitrum side by side and watched it for 30mins.  optimism was always cheaper. why is that? is it a function of how much tvl is on arbitrum? i don't think it's security since you are relying on eth security
undefined says How come there are already 11m arbitrum blocks, even though it launched only a few months ago?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/blocks?p=457209
Genesis block was 343 days ago
undefined says Exactly. Ethereum has about 6300 blocks per day, so 343 days should be a little over 2m blocks. Why is Arbitrum block production so much faster?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/970158430423769119
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says Ok, so if i understand this correctly the block numbers i'm getting are those of the Offchain Labs sequencer. i'm connecting to arbitrum via infura, so their interface seems to be plugged in to the OL sequencer
undefined says however, i'm using web3.py and i'm querying the block number with web3.eth.blockNumber. the documentation suggests that this should return the L2 block number rather than that of the RPC?
undefined says how can I retrieve the L2 block number with web3.py? The infura docs simply point back to the OL docs..
undefined says Does testnet have a single transaction max gas limit?
I deployed a contract on testnet, it used 63,828,204 gas.... I thought the limit was 2.4m?
undefined says thanks. if i understand this correctly,  comparing fees on different L2 at any instant is not a like for like comparison as the fees will depend on the transactions been ferried to L1 at the time. do users of the L2 have the ability to set tips and how much they are willing to pay in any given block?
undefined says no
undefined says arbitrum goes out of its way to remove tips or other weird quirks associated with paying miners for a spot in a block being worked on, as it doesnt make sense in arbitrum's architecture
undefined says those are the same blockNumber you are talking about
undefined says 2.4m limit is only for computational part.
undefined says Hi, what is the url do you use for arbitrum_testnet?
undefined says It's infura, rinkeby testnet
undefined says The aeth you cost is on our testnet? Or cost the mainnet’s aeth?
undefined says I don't understand... The transactions are on arbitrum rinkeby, I'm just reading the numbers on rinkeby-arbiscan
undefined says Got it, if it cost your rinkeby-arbitrum’s gas, then it works as expected.
undefined says I'm trying to estimate the cost on arbitrum one, based on the cost from arbitrum rinkeby
undefined says So if my tx uses 400,000 gas "Gas used by transaction"  on arbiscan.... Can I assume it will use 400,000 gas on arbitrum one
undefined says And then 400,000 * (0.5 gwei) = cost approximately
undefined says You can’t use this to estimate, because the gas cost on l2 has 4 part, and 2 of them are decided by l1, so you may cost 400k on l2 for now, but if next time the gas price on l1 spikes, the cost will higher than 400k, so you’d better use eth_estimateGas to estimate before every tx rather than use a fixed gas limit.
undefined says Ok but just at that moment, it is accurate to use?
undefined says My function uses a lot of gas, like 1 million on testnet, so I'm just trying to see if it will use approximately 1 million gas on arbitrum one
undefined says I need to know if my function is safe is why I ask
undefined says so 1 million gas used * 1 gwei price = about $3 ..... very safe
undefined says We don’t recommend use this way to estimate the gas limit.
undefined says I'm not trying to estimate the limit though
undefined says Im seeing if my function consumes too much gas, costs too much
undefined says Got it, you can also try eth_estimateGas which will also a solution.
undefined says But can you confirm I'm calculating in a semi accurate way for my purpose? 😅
undefined says This is not accurate and we do not recommend
undefined says Ok quick example
undefined says https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0x3af102dffda8f366197fde8239b7f70fb26ec4447a8ffd7f39247043a93318cc
undefined says Gas price was 0.05 gwei on testnet
undefined says If arbitrum one has 1 gwei average price today .... Would my transaction cost 1,017,360 * 1 gwei on arbitrum 1? Approximately
undefined says It won’t
undefined says Why not? How can I calculate the approximate cost ?
undefined says The only difference should be the gas price...
undefined says Because the gas cost will be influenced by the l1’s gas. So use eth_estimateCost will be a better way.
undefined says Won't that estimate the cost of the transaction on rinkeby since my contract is on rinkeby?
undefined says You can see the examples here: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x4a0a939696b1e682059b4b38c8ca1742e2ac4eb2363baf54fca070a6e268b064  https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0xd4775394375ddb91da552f3a6fcdfa21248186589b0045ef8ab477f23fa2c429
undefined says Although those 2 are the same type tx on the same network, the gas cost is also different due to different l1 network gas status.
undefined says My man I've said this like 20 times
undefined says The gas amount used is similar. The gas price changes based on L1 gas, I understand that.
undefined says So if .05 gwei price on testnet.... And the tracker website says it's about 0.5 gwei price right now on arbitrum one.... Then all I have to do is gasUsed * 0.5
undefined says To estimate the cost for me if my contract was deployed on arbitrum one right now and ran that function right now
undefined says Just for a personal estimate
undefined says Ah, if so, you can use this value as a rough estimate, but don't use it in a real working environment.
undefined says Thank you thank you thank you
undefined says I appreciate your time, sorry if I wasn't clear with my question
undefined says Always happy to help
undefined says Arbitrum is fantastic the more I learn about it and how it is designed to scale
undefined says Hi everyone - **__testnet development question__**.
So Arbitrum testnet works with Rinkeby as its layer 1, great.

I'm trying to understand if Gnosis safe will work on Arbitrum testnet??

On our mainnet contracts the owner of the contracts is a Gnosis safe multisig, so we would like to test our testnet using the same method.

Is it possible?
I don't see that Gnosis support directly layer 2 testnets (it does support Rinkeby)
undefined says Hi, if they don’t support our testnet, we also have no ways to use gnosis safe on our testnet.
undefined says Are messages in the L1 inbox just L2 transactions or can it be more than that?
undefined says You can also create retryable ticket using inbox comntract.
undefined says Hi! Currently looking into creating an ERC721 minting contract and realized that in my experience so far on arbi, there haven't been any delayed reveals like there are on L1. Is that by design somehow, or have I just happened across projects that have decided to do instant reveals?
undefined says its just coincidence, there's no reason there can't be delayed reveal just like on L1.
undefined says Hello team, while running my own arb node, I've noticed that sometimes the sequencer feed is sending transaction data that is 8 days old. Is there a reason for that? I thought it would only send new data?
undefined says Hi, any idea where and how did you find the logs?
undefined says Arbitrum is evm-compatible, so you can also deploy it on arbitrum.
undefined says I store the data from the sequencer feed websocket for metric purposes and noticed that occasionally the feed will send my node stale data. In this particular case, the data received was 8 days old
undefined says anyone running an arbitrum node and getting this message: arbitrum/packages/arb-node-core/monitor/inboxReader.go:434","message":"dropping outdated broadcast feed items after after feed reorg"}
undefined says Got it, will let the team know and give you feedback as soon as possible. Btw, do you get the logs as iamaloop said(dropping outdated broadcast feed items after after feed reorg)?
undefined says Where can I find the ArbGas cost per opcode like SSTORE/CREATE etc..? Thanks 🙂
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/protocol_params.go in here?
undefined says With the geth gas consts being similar to Ethereum what makes ArbGas wildly differ by orders of magnitude?
undefined says https://l2fees.info/
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification#instructions
undefined says Hi guys,
Is there a pruned snapshot for arbitrum somewhere? If yes, when was it taken? Just to avoid syncing from scratch (I think it takes 2 days atm)
undefined says You mean Vote event?
undefined says I mean a snapshot of the blockchain itself, for those who run a node
undefined says hello,i have a question :
how to add'@arbitrum/sdk' if i use npm
who can help me ,i can see that in "Offchain Labs Dev Center"
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/973636185131987024
undefined says Snapshots
Mainnet:
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
Rinkeby:
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/rinkeby/db.tar
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/rinkeby/db-archive.tar
undefined says Thanks a lot. Do you know when it was taken approximately?
undefined says I'm not sure tbh
undefined says How to fix the problem of a contract not deploying because size on arbitrum rinkeby? I am trying to deploy a contract thats not even that big but get "ProviderError: not enough funds for gas" even though i have 3 eth in the wallet. If i comment out some of the contract it will deploy as its shorter i guess but i need all of the functionality. HOw can this be fixed??
undefined says I have done manual gasLimit and Price
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hi, did you try use eth_estimateGas to estimate the gas you need to deploy it?
undefined says yes and it was around 500k gas and i set the limit to much much higher
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says You mean deploy your contract? It should be much higher than this, do you add both `from` and `data` in your estimateGas?
undefined says No I just did data. Do I just do from and my address?
undefined says 724384 is the gas estimate after i added the from parameter and i have run it with gas limits from like 5 quadrillion to 5 million and nothing works @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says What is the gas price you set?
undefined says I’ve set high gas prices as high as possible all the way down to 5 mil the various times I’ve tried . What would u reccomendation
undefined says You can use eth_gasPrice to get the price.
undefined says so im using ethers.estimateGas can you give an example of using eth_gasPrice?
undefined says https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-FeeData
undefined says okay so i got a gasPrice of 108263148 and then manually hardcoded a gasPrice of 2x that into the deploy tx and its still failed?
undefined says Oh, can you share me your bytecode and more information by dm me, I can run it on my side to test for you.
undefined says hi，when i restart my syncing node, it back to snapshot point to sync,

Logs this: "Reorg took xxxxx ms"

how do i disable this reorg check to avoid " back to snapshot point to sync" issue ?
undefined says does this config  "--core.checkpoint-gas-frequency" issue? i set it to =50000000000 (50x default)
undefined says Hi, this is how it works, noting needs to do.
undefined says hi, do i need to be part of a whitelist if i want to run a validator with stake on it?
undefined says Okay adding u as a friend to try and dm u
undefined says When I run a rinkeby node it performs the same function as mainnet when I bridge ..?
undefined says Or it is useless to run a node in rinkeby ... someone please clarify this for me
undefined says think rinkeby as a parallel universe, just for devs to try (simualte) stuff, fake, non valuable stuff
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs ?
undefined says yup
undefined says it runs the same code but in a test environment without real value
undefined says yup
undefined says where can i ask to be there?
undefined says when posting calldata to Ethereum, is that cost split across all the messages in a Sequencer Batch or does everyone pay for the exact amount of calldata they post?
undefined says Is it only the L1 inbox inclusion fee that is shared?
undefined says any guide on how to apply a node snapshot? @Big Ben (will Never DM you)
undefined says Download snapshot for the chain you want

Unzip to `/some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet/` that you chose on the host machine.
undefined says @EtherE Can I mine arbitrum...?
undefined says no
undefined says Hi, the tx gas on l2 needed to pay on l1 gas 2 part: l1 fixed fee and l1 calldata fee, the fixed fee is shared equally by all the tx on the batch, and the l1 calldata depends on a single tx’s calldata size.
undefined says Yes, that will likely cause the issue because it isn't setting a checkpoint often enough.  Highly recommended to only use the settings as listed on https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node.  Also make sure you are using the latest released version 1.3.0
undefined says is there any recent snapshot?
undefined says how recent is this?
undefined says This snapshot is not the latest, but if you start from 0, it may help you.
undefined says any idea how old it may be?
undefined says it around 2 months ago.
undefined says @fred 👍
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs @Big Ben (will Never DM you) the official hardware requirements are 
```For AWS, r5d.2xlarge. In addition you need have at least 120GB storage to run it.```
the r5d.3xlarge includes a 300gb nvme, so are you mapping the chaindata to that drive? or that is just for the machine, and the chain data could be in EBS?
undefined says I'm not using AWS but you would need the chaindata directory on the 300gb storage.
undefined says I would think anyway so you don't run out of space.
undefined says Specifically for the low latency NVMe
undefined says thanks! booting up some arbiturm nodes :arbitrum: 🚀
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs when we have the Nitro update (geth), will we be able to use gp2 EBS? cheap storage?
undefined says Nitro has same requirements as geth, fancy storage not required
undefined says i should run latest form here right? https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/arb-node/tags
undefined says is it public info where the arbitrum sequencer is geographically located or which cloud provider is hosting it? obviously there are "races" to get a tx to the sequencer asap and there are some actors who must know this information...
undefined says No. The sequencer will be decentralized/distributed, so there's an expiration date on how long that information would be valuable.
undefined says until that point, insiders with the info have an advantage
undefined says there was a $3m arbitrage tx performed in the last 24 hrs, whoever won the race, pretty sure that person knows
undefined says Message that person. Let us know what you find.
undefined says i'm sure they're in this discord having a laugh
undefined says Yeah - probably just waiting for someone to say something. You probably gave them a hefty giggle just now.
undefined says tx hash?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xba3e786b282983ce6cd9d8b0a59701915c0252ea70fdaa6d5bfb622676693fa7
undefined says Is there a guide to setting up and running a full RPC node?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says Thanks, I have installed it natively rather than wanting to use docker, but there are no instructions on how to then run it that way.
undefined says ...or at least I'm not able to easily work it out from what's there.
undefined says write a guide 👍
undefined says When I figure it out, I will gladly!
undefined says you can inspect how the docker images are built
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs would you please upload newer snapshots?
undefined says You could always start from scratch 😉
undefined says sure, just wanting to accelerate sync time
undefined says Hi,I wonder to know what is the use of arb-rpc-node?
undefined says @Big Ben (will Never DM you) Any guide to run Arbitrum based on download github to local use docker?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#full-nodes
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says This guide is based on an exist docker image. Is there any guide build my own image?
undefined says You can make an eth_getBlockNumber RPC query to get the currently synced L2 block number. To mirror you can download a full node. Here are the bootstrap snapshots you can reference: 
 
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says Maybe this will give you some reference, but I'm not a developer
undefined says Thanks, I wonder to know is there any guide for docker install like this guide in Avalanche https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/blob/master/README.md#docker-install
undefined says I don't know how to install docket, friend👀Waiting for  @  jasonwan to give you help
undefined says Thanks for you help. @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Can you give me some help for docker install?
undefined says I have another question, I try to read the source code of Arbitrum, I know AVM is mostly likely to EVM, when I read EVM source code, I think the entry of the VM is Process the state change based on Ethereum rules in these function https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/core/state_processor.go#L59.  But does AVM has the same mechanism?
undefined says Here is the guide to run arb-node with docker: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says We do have the same function and calculate the gas usage: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says yeah,this guide is about exist image, is there any guide how to build local image, like run some scripts?
undefined says Yeah, but I can't find StateDB code in Arbitrum. Does Arbitrum has the same statedb as Ethereum?
undefined says We have guide to install arbitrum locally: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation
undefined says For node code, I am not so familiar with, I will check with our node development team.
undefined says Ok, thanks, because I can't find the same meaning function in AVM,pls help to check it
undefined says I find 2 python script in scripts directory, can I use 2 python scripts to build image? The arb_deploy.py & build_node_docker.py
undefined says Arbitrum’s state way is unrelated to ethereum. And about those python files, you can run the shell script `scripts/build` to build the docker file.
undefined says The full commend is scripts/build?There are multi scripts, I run build-docker-local?
undefined says It seems that Arbitrum doesn't has own StateDB?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/scripts/build-docker
undefined says OK, thanks , I see
undefined says I only see Machinestate in Arbitrum, is the same as statedb equal to Ethereum?
undefined says Yup, this is how we manage the chain state.
undefined says So that means I could think runone function https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-avm-cpp/avm/src/machinestate/machinestate.cpp#L472.  provide the same feature as Porcess in Ethereum, because this function is also process remaining arb-gas?
undefined says Yes
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node#putting-it-all-together This means I need own Ethereum full node?
undefined says You can also use others rpc service instead.
undefined says hello,I have a question  that how  to run a  full node of Arbitrum
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says Any good rpc server recommand?
undefined says You can find them here https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says 
undefined says See Node providers?
undefined says yes
undefined says thanks
undefined says Hey team! I'm from RockX (leading staking service provider in Asia), I am reaching out to explore on how we can support Arbitrum protocol in aspect of validation. Kindly check who would be the right person I can reach out to? Many thanks!
undefined says Hi！We haven’t opened the validator registration yet, you can continue to pay attention to our follow-up news.
undefined says thank you for the prompt response! and also regarding to sequencer participation - is there any way we could reach out to understand how we can get involved?
undefined says Currently we haven’t announced our decentralized sequencer solution yet. But once we are ready, we will have it an announcement.
undefined says What is arb-rpc-node mean in Arbitrum?
undefined says {"level":"warn","component":"configuration","error":"Post "https://rpc.flashbots.net:8545/": dial tcp 104.26.11.65:8545: i/o timeout","time":"2022-05-13T09:01:46Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-util/configuration/configuration.go:580","message":"Error getting chain ID"}.   This error means the l1 rpc is not useable?
undefined says you can't use flashbot rpc to sync arbitrum
undefined says what kinds of rpc can I use?
undefined says Is there any public free rpc?
undefined says https://chainlist.org/
undefined says Ok，I'll try, thanks
undefined says Is using https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash the preferred way to run a local Arbitrum instance (on top of a local, private L1)?
undefined says Also, if I have that running, what would the RPCs be, both for the private L1 and L2 (Arbitrum)?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says hello,I have a question
in eth-deposit demo,i use for{} to loop control bridge crossing
the program terminates when the first loop is complete, without a second loop
undefined says I wonder why
undefined says Hi I have a question. Do rollup smart contract or L2 bridge contract have smart contract risk?
undefined says CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:30 (message):
  The submodules were not downloaded! GIT_SUBMODULE was turned off or failed.
  Please update submodules and try again.     @gzeon | Offchain Labs There is some errors on docker build, is there any guide how to solve it?
undefined says git submodule update --recursive
undefined says Ok,that means I need first run git submodule update --recursive and then run docker build -t arb-node -f packages/arb-node.Dockerfile packages?
undefined says yes
undefined says OK,thanks,I'll try
undefined says you would be waiting for the same `depositRec` which would be completed when the 1st for loop iterate complete
undefined says The same error when I first run git submodule update --recursive
undefined says you might need to update your git
undefined says update to the latest version?
undefined says yes
undefined says seems the docker image has the old git version?
undefined says which commit are you on right now?
undefined says The latest commit of the repo,I have just clone from offical github repo
undefined says can you to run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
undefined says I missed the --init flag previously
undefined says I'll try
undefined says It works, thanks for you help
undefined says Is there any rpc guide I could test my running node?
undefined says I also wonder to know what's the hardware resouce I need to use when I run Arbitrum Node? Like these guide in Ethereumer https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/README.md#hardware-requirements  @gzeon | Offchain Labs

undefined says I can use these in my local run node?
undefined says Thanks, I know the hardware resource!
undefined says But every time the program ends directly after the first for loop
undefined says @Big Ben (will Never DM you)could you help me?
undefined says what is in the for() ?
undefined says I'm still new fren. I try my best to guide people to help them find their answers. gzeon and jasonwan are the experts 🙂
undefined says You should be able to curl your local node.

undefined says **__Getting more ARETH instead of small drips everyday__**
Question regarding getting Rinkbey ETH to bridge for ARETH for Arbitrum Testnet.
We're starting to test our dapp, but we're going to need a lot more ETH than what we can get from the faucets.. We need about 30 ARETH for our tests.. How can I get some in one go instead of getting 0.1-0.3 a day..?
undefined says **__Deployment - Hardhat - ProviderError: transaction ran out of gas__**

We're trying to deploy on Arbitrum testnet, but keep getting this error:
ProviderError: transaction ran out of gas

This is weird because sometimes it's happening and sometimes it does not.
Here is what we tried doing:
1. add the `gas` hardhat setting with `1e9` which is wayyy more than needed
2. add the `gasMultiplier` hardhat setting with `2` which is wayyy more than needed
3. Although out contract is very small, we also tried using `allowUnlimitedContractSize` set to `true`. But we also saw that regular transactions and not even deployments are failing with this error.

This leads us to believe it has nothing to do with our settings, and maybe something is wrong on the network itself?

We're using the RPC and chainid like described here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_testnet
undefined says Hi, do you know what arb-rpc-node means in source code? Is Layer1 or Layer2?
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says layer2
undefined says How can I understand arb-rpc-node? Seems there is no explain in whitepaper
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says we don't have a lot or rinkeby eth rn but might be able to spare some for partners, you can send me a dm and/or email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says I don't think we have specific docs available
undefined says Yeah, but could you give me some high level explain? I wonder to know what it use,like I could think it's a bridge between L1 and L2 or it's actually Arbitrum Node
undefined says it's the node
undefined says What's the difference between arb-node?
undefined says its the same thing?
undefined says Arbitrum has 2 nodes, the arb-node and the arb-rpc-node, the arb-node do some things like challenge, the arb-rpc-node actually aggregator message and exect L2 transaction? Am I right?
undefined says `arb-rpc-node` is `arb-node`, but it can function in 3 mode, `sequencer`, `aggregator` and `forwarder`
undefined says Oh, I understand, thanks for you explain
undefined says and fyi we will be moving to nitro stack in the coming months and the classic stack will be deprecated
undefined says Does Nitro compatible One?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/838ba2193e84f54df316a5ea6b0bd3ed4d0fdb37/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md
undefined says Thanks，when Nitro go to mainnet, if I run Nitro, could I get the block start from 0 or start from current switch blocknumber?
undefined says Hi, it will keep arbitrum one’s state to upgrade, so you don’t need to re-sync from block 0.
undefined says Ok, that means if switch blocknumber is 100, I have to run One to get information from 0-99, and run Nitro from 100 to future?
undefined says Nitro can't compatible information before switch?
undefined says Wrong read, if currently you run a node, when nitro alive, you don’t need to re-sync. But if your node join the network after nitro upgrade, you just need to sync from other node and don’t need to run arbitrum one version node to sync.
undefined says Ok, thanks

undefined says It is node related. The recommend alchemy RPC provider can't deploy my contract with: `"execution ran out of gas\"`

whereas the rinkeby.arbitrum.io rpc successfully creates the contract, but errors later on with a transaction: `\"message\":\"transaction ran out of gas\"`
undefined says Consolidating `transaction ran out of gas` issues to https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/975324736257142876
undefined says Hello, where can I find the metric of the image? thank you
undefined says props to whoever wrote the arbitrum spec documentation. it is excellent
undefined says Is there a way from event logs to get method name of transaction?
 
testnet event logs show a method field, is that related to the name of the method?
undefined says 
undefined says You can try this website: https://www.4byte.directory/
undefined says when was arb-rinkeby archive node snapshot last updated?
what are minimal requirements for running arb-rinkeby archive node?
undefined says The snapshot updated about 2 month ago. We recommend use z1d 2xlarge in AWS or other equal hardware.
undefined says does still require 8 vcpu & 64 gig on testnet if i just want to use it for rpc? (no sequencer, no relay, no L1 validation)
undefined says you probably can do like 4vcpu and 32g ram but it might not be very stable
undefined says thanks, do you have info on current state size of arb-rinkeby?
undefined says Hey guys, I have a rebasing (elastic supply) token deployed on Arbitrum, how do I bridge these tokens to L1?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway
undefined says Hey! How was this contract (https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C) deployed? Contracts at that address are deployed using nick's method with tx hash of 0xeddf9e61fb9d8f5111840daef55e5fde0041f5702856532cdbb5a02998033d26, but that shouldn't work on arbitrum due to the different gas metering, and that tx hash does not seem to exist on arbitrum. Was it just placed there as a precompile? For reference, here's the repo that contract is from: https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy
undefined says our standard gateway don't support rebasing token, you would need to use a custom gateway that handle the rebase logic; alternatively you can use a wrapper that won't rebase
undefined says Yea it was placed there administratively because of the gas difference
undefined says How was that done exactly, is that part of the AVM somewhere? Searched on github but couldn't find it. For context, I'm wondering if this contract would still exist at this address if another arbitrum-rollup or testnet is spun up in the future
undefined says I believe the ArbOwner contract has the affordances.
Another instance wouldn't have this by default
undefined says Quid pro quo tho, now I'm curious who's forking us and gave you the alpha 👀👀👀👀
undefined says jk 😛
undefined says here is the function used https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/962ab51cffff5d57daee0f4b031d69a3224d51d4/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbOwner.sol#L20
undefined says Hm ok, I'll have to read up more on what the arbowner is to see how this would work for other chains. Who is the arb owner for the current mainnet deployment?
undefined says Heh context here is just that I'm looking for a determistic deployer that I can be sure will work on any EVM compatible chain
undefined says was wondering if I'd need to deploy a new one with same priv key+nonce to workaround the gas limit issue
undefined says contract interface for chain admin functionality (ie upgrades), currently controlled by multisig
undefined says hm yea, hard to make assumptions about gas limits / prices
undefined says got it, thanks for the help!
undefined says When I download the https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/archive/refs/tags/v1.3.0.tar.gz,  i found the /arb-avm-cpp/cmake/cable folder empty,This will cause problems with my build.cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBUILD_TESTING=0 -DENABLE_TCMALLOC=true

undefined says I git clone the arbitrum source code and found that there are many things in the cable folder, I am very confused, how do I deploy a releases version
undefined says Can someone give me some help
undefined says I think I know why.
undefined says I didn't pull the submodule code
undefined says Do you know what's sideloads means in MachineExecutionConfig? @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hey i'm trying to understand the L2->L1 outbox  message passing in detail.

 I understand how users can circumvent a malicious sequencer censoring transactions by 'forcing' the transaction into the inbox after a 24hr waiting period. 

What are the assurances  about getting messages out of the L2? I read here (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/arbos/Geth.md#mixdigest-and-extradata) that ArbOS's merkleaccumulator is stored in the mixdigest and extradata field of each L2 block. So the outbox entries are part of the fraud-proof game right? The L2->L1 message passing read.me docs (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/L1_L2_Messages.md#l2-to-l1-messages-lifecycle) state that "ArbOS gathers all outgoing messages, Merklizes them, and publishes the root as an OutboxEntry in the chain's outbox. Note that this happens "automatically".

How exactly does this happen 'automatically'? It's kind of opaque for me to trace the mainnet beta transactions to the outbox. I looks like this transaction (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x99ea51b5d088fe7c68a42aea99066cebfe7a18f37145444f3a16e126c554892b#eventlog) makes an outbox entry (in addition to many other transactions to the rollup contract and others). The transaction is coming ultimately from an EOA, '0xddffdaf55326b9765a2e69ebf0e6dca11ae669cd'.

Can someone share some insight about how the outbox entry is made? Thanks ~ 🙏
undefined says you need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
undefined says Hi, this tx was sent by a validator, and the address you said: 0xDdfFDAF55326B9765a2e69ebf0e6Dca11ae669cD. Is the validator’s address.
undefined says ahh okay right, yes the whitelisted active validator set? any light you can shine on the progressive road to decentralization? maybe a blog post I missed, or maybe it's just coming soon*tm : )
undefined says just to clarify, validators are currently staking reputation and have reputational damage if they censor or report incorrect outbox entries ?
undefined says My node is having a hard time, trying to keep sync? aws r5d.2xlarge using nvme, running latest official docker image, cpu usage is low, ram is low, plenty of space in drive... any tips?
how can i increase log verbosity without stopping the node?
undefined says how can i set up my node to work as an aggregator?
undefined says What is the difference between `v1.3.0-validator-b176b7a` and `v1.3.0-d994f7d`? Should I upgrade to the validator version if I am not a validator? https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/arb-node/tags @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hi, yes, it is a whitelist validator, and we will have decentralized sequencer first.
undefined says If validator chooses to cheat, other validator will challenge it, and because this challenge is controlled by l1, so the challenge is 100% safe and will slash the one who cheat.
undefined says You don’t need to run validator’s image.
undefined says Hi, can you describe what issues your node has?
undefined says hi guys,  I run the command：RUN cd /arb-rpc-node && go mod download ，It is very slow, I am in mainland China, is there any way to speed it up?
undefined says I wonder if we would have the same problem if we deployed in aws
undefined says I just want to speed it up so I can do better testing for accelerated support of the arbitrum chain
undefined says Have you tried change a faster GOPROXY?
undefined says understood
undefined says that's about block production on L2, but there is a challenge period on the outbox entry which is on L1? like the white listed validator EOA just called self-destruct on a contract which I can't see bc it was self-destructed and the log registers an event for an outbox entry creation. I get how 1 honest actor on L2 can force dishonest actors to get slashed and do the bisection and one-step proof, but about the step with the EOA actually creating the outbox entry on L1, which on-chain contract can I see the logic for challenging the outbox entry creation?
undefined says also L1 will probably remove self-destruct op-code in the future
undefined says https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/selfdestruct
undefined says https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/4760
undefined says this is an example of the outbox entry creation tx
undefined says (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x99ea51b5d088fe7c68a42aea99066cebfe7a18f37145444f3a16e126c554892b#eventlog)
undefined says Hi, the node you see was self-destruct happened here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L270 , and start here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/facets/RollupUser.sol#L73, and follow this step, you will see outbox entry created. As you said the challenge, it will start from here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/facets/RollupUser.sol#L73, and this won’t affect the outbox.
undefined says Hi guys,I'm following **arb-node.Dockerfile** document to `COPY --from=arb-avm-cpp /home/user/.hunter /home/user/.hunter`
undefined says What does **.hunter**  do? I didn't find this file
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs  Can you help me?
undefined says 
undefined says that's a config file for hunter package manager
undefined says I build the cpp-base separately and didn't find this file
undefined says generated during the build process of arb-avm-cpp
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says hi  @gzeon | Offchain Labs @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  🧐
undefined says you need to run the build steps https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/9d7b743dc51b3aacf721ef5037728da650cb6432/packages/arb-node.Dockerfile#L7-L37
undefined says Yes, I'm sure there is no such file
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I built it locally and found no
undefined says Maybe you can try  @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says did you update submodules before building
undefined says we don't really support manual building, please use our docker image if you want to run a node
undefined says I need to build them manually and I want to integrate them into our own docker
undefined says my updated submodules
undefined says Can I not .hunter?
undefined says What does it do
undefined says I am not sure but you can try
undefined says I think you would need it tho
undefined says it should be generated during the cmake step https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/9d7b743dc51b3aacf721ef5037728da650cb6432/packages/arb-node.Dockerfile#L15
undefined says 
undefined says By the way, `go build -v . /...`
undefined says ./...   What does it mean?
undefined says Both unfamiliar with the go language
undefined says `go help packages`

> An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more "..." wildcards, each of which can match any string, including the empty string and strings containing slashes. Such a pattern expands to all package directories found in the GOPATH trees with names matching the patterns. As a special case, x/... matches x as well as x's subdirectories. For example, net/... expands to net and packages in its subdirectories.
undefined says similar to `**` in bash
undefined says I understand. Thank you very much. @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hi - in Campaign, can we do all tasks in last week ?
or MUST do anytask in thats week
i mean can we do bridge tasks in week 8 ?
or must do it in week 1 ?
undefined says loosing sync, was always some blocks (+-50) behind the tip, a reboot did the trick, but it costs 40 mins down
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs 
I've read all the docs, but could you clarify to me some concepts?

what is an aggregator? a node that send directly to the inbox instead of forwarding to the sequencer? how can i run my nodes as an aggregator (i now that sequencer tx have priority over those)

what is a relay node? a normal node that forwards all to the sequencer? - how to run the node in relay mode?

what is a feed node? how to run the node in feed mode?

thanks in advance
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I'm running the validator image, because it was the latest, but I'm not a validator... will that hurt something?
undefined says hello frens, how much time does it take for a message to arrive from arbi to mainnet?
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs any help with my previous questions?
undefined says Do not use the validator image, use the 1.3.0 image that is not marked for validator
undefined says The feed is how the sequencer provides real time transactions to all the nodes
undefined says The relay is just a lightweight client for forwarding feed messages
undefined says An aggregator node was only functional on a chain that is not configured with a sequencer, so doesn’t apply to arbitrum one
undefined says Hi, about every 3-5 minutes, you can see those batch tx here: https://arbiscan.io/batches, and each batch tx will cost around 120m l1 gas.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs
undefined says Patience is a virtue.  Directions will be announced in #📢︱announcements  when the time comes
undefined says so we dont know yet its possible or not ?
undefined says The event will start on mid June, so just be patient.
undefined says Sure
undefined says thanks
undefined says btw your pfp looks so nice
i like harrypotter too 🧙‍♂️
undefined says Ah, thanks!
undefined says Expecto Patronum
undefined says For Arbitrum bridge, the contract address is unique or there will be more?
undefined says 
undefined says Unique, here is our address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Thanks  for your reply.
undefined says But in the future(nitro upgrade), we will deploy some contact to new address: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#protocol-contracts
undefined says When?
undefined says We don’t have a tl, but it should be soon.
undefined says OK. Thanks!
undefined says Yohhh
undefined says Waiting
undefined says Hello, I was trying to bridge some ERC20 tokens from Arbitrum to Ethereum (and vice versa).. On looking through the docs, all the links provided use `arb-ts`.. I want to do this through Solidity actually and was wondering how to do so.. As far as I have understood it, I need to call `L2GatewayRouter.outBoundTransfer` (for withdrawals) and `GatewayRouter.outBoundTransfer` (for deposits).. However, I cannot find these contracts in the github or on npm.. How should I be importing these in my contract?
undefined says For reference, this is how I do it with Optimism — 
L2 -> L1 :: https://github.com/Buddle-finance/buddle-protocol/blob/main/contracts/source/BuddleSrcOptimism.sol#L87
L1 -> L2 :: https://github.com/Buddle-finance/buddle-protocol/blob/main/contracts/bridge/BuddleBridgeOptimism.sol#L119
undefined says what do i need to participate? im running nodes, and making tests shotting a lot of txs
undefined says Can users unilaterally withdraw their assets from the currently running Arbitrum rollup to L1? i.e. can they withdraw to L1 even if the Arbitrum sequencer / block producer / validator / whatever you want to call it is uncooperative?
undefined says I see on this page: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets
the answer seems to be "yes". but I have recently encountered some out of date documentation in another rollup project, so I just want to make sure my understanding + the docs are up to date and correct 🙂
undefined says arb-ts is depreciated, please use arbitrum-sdk
here are some tutorials: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/

the contracts you are looking for is here
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2GatewayRouter.sol
undefined says it is possible, you can submit any L2 tx to the L1 delayed inbox and force include after 24 hours
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says thanks. is there an easy to use GUI that can be used to do this? or do users currently have know how to interact directly with the smart contracts?
undefined says not at the moment
undefined says would you say this claim on L2 Beat is false then?
> Funds can be frozen if the centralized validator goes down. Users cannot produce blocks themselves and exiting the system requires new block production (CRITICAL).
https://l2beat.com/projects/arbitrum/#exit-mechanisms-1
undefined says that is referring to extended validator downtime, where what you asked is a uncooperative / censoring sequencer
undefined says I would consider not producing blocks (or not producing a block that includes the user's withdrawal tx) to be uncooperative.
undefined says if validator is not producing any block at all, the rollup would be frozen; we have plan to expend our validator set in the short future
undefined says but if they are producing any block, it must include all delayed inbox message to be consider as valid state
undefined says ok, so it is true then that if the sequencer is not producing blocks, then the user cannot withdraw their funds from the rollup?
undefined says validators produce rollup blocks, and yes if validators are not producing block, fund will be temporarily frozen
undefined says it says here:
> Being a validator is permissionless--anyone can do it. Offchain Labs provides open source validator software, including a pre-built Docker image.

https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#validators
so can the user theoretically become a validator themselves and produce a block to push their withdrawal through?
undefined says we currently have a validator whitelist, the docs seems to be inaccurate
undefined says ah. good to know. thanks for answering my questions!
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs can i copy (or rsync) the /data/arbitrum-mainnet dir to a another new node in order to get a fast sync? how do you compose the snapshots?
undefined says You can, as long as you stop the node first
undefined says i've done an Rsync and it seems its not working the node started from block 0
undefined says ohh i didn't topped the other
undefined says stop/start cost me like 40 mins downtime
undefined says how do i do a gracefull stop?
undefined says are you just sopping the container?
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs can you teach me how to grecefully stop the arbitrum-one node? cant find that in the docs, stopping the container is not working for the data copy
undefined says If you create a `db_checkpoints` folder inside the same directory that `db` is in, you can then send a `SIGUSR1` signal to arb-node and it will save a snapshot in that directory
undefined says without having to stop arb-node
undefined says Thanks for these.. Should I just copy the contents of these and put them in my project? As in, is there no way to import these contracts via npm or yarn?
undefined says Also, not planning on using the sdk at all since we are creating contracts to make it easier for users to bridge their tokens across multiple chains.. So the main issue I'm running into rn is importing the relevant contracts and making calls (internal txns)
undefined says Hi guys! We are developing an open world game. We have decided to deploy our contracts in the Arbitum network.
Could you share information about whether there is a chat of game developers somewhere, maybe someone saw it?
undefined says So you are building your own bridge or use our official bridge?
undefined says Please send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com.
undefined says hello frens, how much time on average does it take for a message to arrive from arbi to mainnet?
undefined says Are you referring to getting from the Arbitrum network to the Ethereum mainnet?
undefined says Indeed 🙂 how long (on average) for me to post data from arbi to an ethereum mainnet contract
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hi, if you mean the time for sequencer to post the l2 tx calldata to l1, it is 2-5 minutes: https://arbiscan.io/batches, but if you mean you send a tx (like withdraw token) to l1, it will take 8 days because of fraud proof window.
undefined says Hi, I am simply unable to deploy a contract on Arbitrum using Truffle. I keep getting "could not deploy due to insufficient funds" . I tried different RPC networks, gasPrice, gasLimit, etc but cannot make it work
undefined says My balance is shown correctly, worth around 300$ of ETH on Arbitrum. Should be well enough to deploy a contract that needs 1321173 units
undefined says Thanks ! Basically i'd need users to trigger a transaction on L2 to whitelist their address on a contract on L1 inside a mapping. That would require a tx right? hence 8 days?
undefined says Or i can achieve that with just calldata
undefined says 7-8 days is our bridge needed, you can also use other 3rd part bridge to send your tx, I only know those bridges can bridge assets, not sure message. You can go to our portal and have a see: https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says You can not achieve this by calldata batches.
undefined says Thanks Jason !
undefined says no ideas ? The wallet obviously have enough funds to deploy on Arbitrum....
undefined says So technically both.. Essentially we let users deposit some tokens with us on an L2.. then someone provides liquidity on L1 which are bridged to L2 using the official bridge(s).. The deposited funds go to the LP on L1.. Also another LP provides funds on the destination L2 who then withdraws their funds from us after they've been bridged.. Based on this proposal by vitalik — https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/cross_layer_2_bridges
For reference, these are our contracts for Optimism —
- Source Contract (optimism) — https://github.com/Buddle-finance/buddle-protocol/blob/main/contracts/source/BuddleSrcOptimism.sol
- Bridge Contract (ethereum) — https://github.com/Buddle-finance/buddle-protocol/blob/main/contracts/bridge/BuddleBridgeOptimism.sol
- Destination Contract (optimism) — https://github.com/Buddle-finance/buddle-protocol/blob/main/contracts/destination/BuddleDestOptimism.sol
undefined says We want to make similar contracts for Arbitrum using the official Arbitrum bridges
undefined says Basically, I need help to figure out how to import Arb contracts like this — https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/greeter/contracts/arbitrum/GreeterL2.sol#L4
undefined says Ah crap, I just found those on npmjs.. Maybe the docs should have a list of deployed contracts on npm
undefined says What's up with WETH stuff on Arbitrum? Why wasn't WETH finally made obsolete? Seems like a missed opportunity?
undefined says I'm guessing it has to do with the whole EVM equivalence thing?
undefined says Ok, now I have a new error.. Effectively the solidity version of the contracts are too low (we're using `0.8.11` and the contracts are at `0.6.*`).. I did find nitro-contracts which are `0.8.*` but those do not include the GatewayRouters.. How shall I proceed to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens?
undefined says Another issue I have is when using `Inbox.depositEth`, the funds are credited to the `msg.sender` on Arbitrum.. Is there a way to specify where to bridge the funds to? Effectively I need to send funds that my L1 contract receives to my L2 contract..
undefined says Last day left for hackathon 😅
undefined says its on npm package `arb-bridge-eth` and `arb-bridge-peripherals` e.g.
`import "arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol";`
undefined says Yeah we found those but the issue we have now is that the solidity versions don’t match.. we’re using 0.8.11 and these are at 0.6.x so our contracts don’t compile with these packages installed
undefined says Would they be added to the nitro contracts anytime soon or is nitro changing how the gateway works?
undefined says it could be your contract deployment is reverting, can you dm me your contract?
undefined says here are some key nitro changes https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md
existing bridge gateway api should be still useable after nitro
undefined says you need to use createRetryableTicket instead of depositEth for this
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/78118ba205854374ed280a27415cb62c37847f72/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L247
you can check how `depositEth` works under-the-hood, basically it create a retryable ticket with empty data and point the refund (the deposit) to `destinationAddress` (aliased msg.sender)
so you bascially call `createRetryableTicketNoRefundAliasRewrite` with similar setup but have  `destinationAddress` as the address you want to deposit fund
undefined says You should be able to config something like this https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/hardhat.base-config.json to use multiple solidity version
undefined says Ah I see.. so they both call `_deliverMessage` under the hood and I can simply replicate that.. This should solve the issue.. thanks a lot!
undefined says Ah.. That's how its done.. thanks.. though I feel like a noob now 😅
undefined says everyday we learn something
undefined says I actually have one more question.. This is more best practices tho.. Should all these contracts that we typically import be a devDependecy? Or should it be a regular one?
undefined says Ah actually this doesn't work because I import a file in a higher solidity version.. For now I'm just going to copy the contents of the interface and have them in my project directories.. The exact error is this —
```
These files import other files that use a different and incompatible version of Solidity:

  * contracts/arbitrum/BuddleSrcArbitrum.sol (^0.8.11) imports arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/gateway/ITokenGateway.sol (^0.6.11)
```
undefined says ah right, think your solution is good
undefined says Usually in dev
undefined says doesn’t really matter unless you have a UI of sort that consume the same package
undefined says theres a small issue tho.. I need to access `l1TokenToGateway` (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/gateway/GatewayRouter.sol#L35) so I can approve the right token so `safeTransferFrom` works.. Because when I bridge from L1 to L2 the safeTransferFrom happens in the modified ERC20 contract which is stored here.. So I am doing something like `token.approve(_router.l1TokenToGateway()[_tokens[i]], _amounts[i])` before calling `ITokenGateway(L1GatewayRouterAddress).outboundTransfer(...)` but if I do the same strat of copying the files in my directories, I would have to do all the imports and stuff too.. Hence the decision to only copy the interface.. But I can't really access the state variables of a child contract from an interface :/
undefined says Ah I see.. Will keep that in mind for the future..
undefined says You can just add the field to the interface file
undefined says I just realised I can simply copy just the function definition of `GatewayRouter.getGateway` and have this issue solved
undefined says yeah effectively that
undefined says although I thought u aren't allowed to have variables in interfaces? Maybe I'm wrong
undefined says ya I mean as a function definition
undefined says You can convert the abi to an interface using tool like https://gnidan.github.io/abi-to-sol/
undefined says ah so just take the abi of GatewayRouter and make an interface and save that instead?
undefined says Yes
undefined says would be easier to include everything
undefined says also would I need to approve the token for L2 to L1 as well? I am a bit confused about this part since they both go back to GatewayRouter's `outboundTransfer`
undefined says it depends, most token support the bridgeBurn method which don’t require approve, but some token like LPT use a custom gateway that don’t support bridgeburn and require approval
undefined says yeah.. ok I shall look into that.. although I just needed that one function from GatewayRouter that wasn't in ITokenGateway.. but maybe the other way would be cleaner with an IGatewayRouter file
undefined says Ah I see.. so for our PoC I'll just stick to the easy version and assume bridgeBurn is supported lol
undefined says sounds good to me
undefined says one last question.. How should I be encoding the data for the correct decode of this `(uint256 _maxSubmissionCost, ) = abi.decode(_data, (uint256, bytes));`? `_data` is `bytes calldata`.. Can I simply do `bytes("10000")` or is str to uint256 not supported?
reference — https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L232
undefined says nvm I think I got it.. `abi.encode(uint256(10000))` this should work right?
undefined says u need to encode an empty bytes too
undefined says why? The first thing the function does is decode it as a `uint256` and I am using `10000` as my `maxSubmissionCost`.. So wouldn't it simply decode to `10000`?
undefined says Its decoding (uint256,bytes) and dropping the bytes
undefined says so data need to be (uint256,bytes) encoded or ur decode will revert
undefined says So something like this — `abi.encode(uint256(10000),bytes(""))` ?
undefined says Yes
undefined says For the Inbox address, should we be using the Delayed Inbox address or the Sequencer Inbox address? (As given here — https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses#protocol-l1) Also side note, how do I reach the actual contract from a deployed proxy?
undefined says You need call delayed inbox. The address of proxy you can directly call because it will read your calldata and use delegate call to run the real logic.
undefined says I would like to ask whether the token I just issued on BinanceSmartChain can be cross-chain to Arbitrum.
undefined says I would like to ask whether the token I just issued on Ethereum can be cross-chain to Arbitrum.
undefined says Since some cross-chain bridges require enough users' tokens to support them.
undefined says our native bridge only support eth<>arb1
undefined says if you need to bridge from bsc you will need to use 3rd party bridges
https://portal.arbitrum.one/#bridges
undefined says Can the ethereum token I just issued cross chain to Arbitrum as well?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says Can the token be issued directly in Arbitrum?
undefined says I also want to ask: since L2 is not a blockchain, can tokens be directly issued on Arbitrum?
undefined says Arbitrum is evm compatible, you can do anything l1 on l2.
undefined says Arbitrum is a blockchain layer2 network, which has the same function as other l1 chains besides miners function .
undefined says You can also develop evm contract on l2 and send tx.
undefined says OK. Thanks!
undefined says Np
undefined says 👍
undefined says Thanks
undefined says 👍
undefined says 👍🏻
undefined says hey guys, I'm doing some debugging and want to rule something out as being the culprit of the behaviour. is it possible for `block.timestamp` to be different inside of two different contracts within the same transaction? I assume not but want to make sure
undefined says It is not, it will be same in the same tx.
undefined says hey, websocket is down?  wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws ?
undefined says yes, looks like someone was hammering the websocket endpoint, will see what we can do to bring it back up.  In the meantime, feel free to use a 3rd party  provider like Alchemy or Quicknode for websocket support
undefined says ok
undefined says I'm making an NFT app which can bridge my ERC721 token from L1 to L2. for reference, I checked out Arbitrum-tutorials(custom token) in GitHub, which looks like ‘amount’ is the only variable being sent to L2. In case of an ERC721 token, how would I send other data to L2? (e.g. uri, token-id, etc) Or, do I just send ‘amount’ data to L2 and view other data in L1?
undefined says can anyone share any tx where a DA is challenged and/or contract address that handles the dispute resolution process
undefined says Hi, our bridge does not support nft bridge, it’s erc20 bridge. If you want to cross your nft, you can try others way like create a retryable ticket on l1 to call your factory contract on l2 to mint l2 NFT.
undefined says Here is the contract code to process the challenge: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/facets/RollupUser.sol#L274. And it’s address is 0xC12BA48c781F6e392B49Db2E25Cd0c28cD77531A on mainnet.
undefined says Is it possible to use a mainnet geth mode with mode --light as l1 endpoint for my arbi node or does it have to be full?
undefined says Are u saying that i cannot use erc20bridge or i cannot use assetbridge at all for nft? (E.g. extending assetbridge to nft requirements)
Any similar example i can check with?
undefined says is there a way to check the installed version after installation?
undefined says I built the binary myself
undefined says hey) in last news) what is that TTX?
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs about the New v1.4.0 Node release, estimated downtime, stopping old, and starting new container?
undefined says is there an specific channel for those who run a node?
undefined says not exactly
undefined says if you're inquiring about running a node we have docs for that
undefined says its just that its nice to be in touch with other node admins, many other communities has one, thx
undefined says put the node up to date?
undefined says actualy?
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs stopping the node, switching to new docker image and started again.. costs me like 1 hour downtime.. is that expected or I am doing something wrong?
undefined says ---
hey, is there any limit on the size of the tx arbitrum allows? maybe a `calldata` limit?
undefined says Hi, what are the incentives to run a node?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/970440797558284288
undefined says hey everyone, i have a question.
Is it possible "tax" erc20 withdrawals from l2 to l1 or "pause" them using the custom-token-bridging tutorial (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging). Im wondering  if i need to build my own custom gateway, which seems like it'd be lot more complexity, or if i can use the custom generic gateway (given in the tutorial) and then just customize how bridgeBurn gets called on the l2 side (like a "pause" modifier)?
undefined says Time to start node highly dependent on the latency of the storage volume that database is stored on.  You can use `ioping` to test latency, anything above 100us will take a while to startup.  With 100us or less, usually takes about 20 minutes to start
undefined says No, L1 node required to be a full node
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs 
in my tests, i've sent a lot of transactions, (self transfers).. why they do not use the same amount of gas.. they are all self transfers...
is that because of the rollup compression?  how can i accurate estimate gas limit? 
is the gas use affected by L1 and network load?

i've read the docs, but im looking for a simple explanation
undefined says https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411912001051-ERC20-token-transfer-from-MainNet-to-Arbitrum
```When the chain is under congestion the gas needed can fluctuate, for example, the price for storage that affects the max gas needed``` 
its a bit confusing....  why gas price will affect gas use?
undefined says Im using the custom-token-bridge tutorial as a foundation for my project, however the openzepplin library version being used is ^3.4.2 while current version is ^4.4.2 i believe. should i update the oz version in the package.json or is it better to use the library of the version used in the starter code
undefined says Erc20 bridge only used for erc20 token, we don’t support nft transfer on our bridge, you may design it for yourself.
undefined says It's better to keep the version consistent
undefined says This is because the gas on l2 has 4 part, which are l1 fixed cost, l1 calldata cost, l2 computational cost and l2 storage cost. And l1 cost part depends on l1’s gas price, so it will be different when l1 gas price changes. You should use eth_estimateGas before send your tx to get the gas limit for better.
undefined says 2.4m limit on computational gas.
undefined says Running fullnode does not have any incentives like others network.
undefined says Is there a eta for chain link vrf on arbitrum? (Or any alternative)
undefined says i understand that higher gas price in L1, translates to higher gas price in L2, but... why it would translate into more `gas use` ie more computational steps? the L2 transactions is the same, why it will vary the opcodes it execute? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Because your gas use will also contain l1 part, not only l2 arbgas. And if you want to track the arbgas usage, it will be the same. Here is our arbgas’ sop code charge: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification#instructions
undefined says You can also call `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to see, in `feeStats` field, it has the detail that each part gas used.
undefined says so, as you are fixing the L2 ArbGas price, at the moment the tx is sent and the secuencer accepts it, then if you have a gas price increase in L1, you pay that using more (burning let's say) L2 ArbGas, just to compensate that.

does it works like that, at the high level perspective? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs , the estimation is ok, i can send an upper limit, I'm just trying to understand what is happening under the hood
undefined says The gas limit is for all the 4 part, not only l2 part, we will combine those 4 part to a single part like l1 do to simplify the user’s experience. So l1 price increases will let the outcome gas increase. The eth_estimateGas we return will higher than the exact gas usage is the same reason.
undefined says Hi ..
undefined says 
undefined says Is that all there is to node configuration?
undefined says For example, I want to customize the node port and modify the node data storage path, how do I configure it? Note: I didn't start with a docker image, I compiled it and ran it
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  Is there a document on this?
undefined says Or conf file example
undefined says @Ed Felten | Arbitrum  Can you help me? thanks!
undefined says Yup, we compile geth to wasm. For other clients, we currently do not have the plan, but that client use wasm support language is needed.
undefined says Sorry, I am not so familiar with node, but @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs will help you when he comes back.
undefined says ok,thanks
undefined says Why my eth balance is not showing in layer 1 after connecting arbiturm bridge  ? I tried several times but it is showing 0 balance ?
undefined says you can see all the configurable setting if you start with --help flag
undefined says to change the storage path:
--persistent.global-config /some/path
to change rpc port:
--node.rpc.port 8547
undefined says are you doing a withdrawal? it would take 7 days and you have to claim in L1
undefined says arb-node help，I don't see - node.rpc.port
undefined says https://gist.github.com/gzeoneth/1c8da96f2aad95d6f09baec91ddcfc13
undefined says Not withdrawal. While doing bridge after adding layer 2 to mm it suppose to layer1 balance right but in my it is not showing, idk why ?
undefined says I am worried to do bridge it shows my balance ofc i can't do bridge from L1 TP /L2 unless it shows L1 balance.
undefined says you might want to check if you are connecting to Arb1 or ArbRinkeby
here is our arb1 rpc: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/mainnet#connect-your-wallet

undefined says Hi. I'm trying to understand how erc20 bridge sends msg from L1 to L2 on code level. I thought it should somehow create a retryableticket and send it to inbox, but I don't see that on erc20bridge.ts - deposit() - depositTxOrGas() in arbitrum-sdk. could you help me find it?
undefined says thanks, btw i know how to do it, my question was `which`  clarification: based on your experience running this nodes, which numbers are you using? thanks again
undefined says Just set it to 65536 like the stackexchange example.
undefined says For how to use arb-sdk to deposit erc20 token, you can see an example here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/token-deposit/scripts/exec.js , and within the contract execution, it will finally call this function to create retryable ticket: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/L1ArbitrumMessenger.sol#L35
undefined says Yes. I was working through the token deposit example. With ur reply(on l1arbitrummessenger.sol), i can see where the retryableticket is being created. Thanks!
undefined says Happy to help!

```
undefined says Hi, this is because the timestamp is l1 block’s timestamp, and the network update this timestamp about every minutes.
undefined says Also, the block.number returns will also the l1’s block number, but you can call arbsys to get the real block number of l2: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-os/arbos/builtin/ArbSys
undefined says i was getting that via RPC to the node, thanks
undefined says It’s the same to rpc’s timestamp. Happy to help.
undefined says Does Arbitrum has Archive node?
undefined says yes if you run with `--node.cache.allow-slow-lookup`
undefined says thanks
undefined says hi, i can see this from docs, but which is the p2p peers port like 30303 in geth
undefined says im running a node fully sync and i cant see the port 9642 open (using netstats)
undefined says how is the p2p communication done? how do thenode knows about new blocks? is it polling the sequencer?
undefined says There is no peer to peer communication.  The sequencer broadcasts new blocks through port 9642, which all the nodes connect to (available on https://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed)
undefined says If you run more than one node, you can start a relay, the relay connects to the feed, and then all your nodes can get the feed from the relay
undefined says will be in nitro?
undefined says not initially, may be added on later
undefined says Seems the transaction actually execution is not in Arbitrum, is in arb-os?
undefined says The node in arbitrum network will run arbos.
undefined says Yeah, when I read the source code, I think the arb-node is get the result from the arbos, so the arbos is actually execution the transaction? So when I use the api to get trace, it actually invoke arbos function to get the replay the transaction? Do you think I'm right?
undefined says Yeah, arbos is the actual program to execute transaction.
undefined says Any guide to see the complete RPC interface of Arbitrum?
undefined says Hey Arbitrum team (asking here too just to get a quicker answer).
I was wondering, is it possible to determine what will be the block hash a couple of block from now?
lets say I have full control on which transaction/s will be included in the block I'm trying to determine the block hash of.
So to clarify, I know what is the current block hash + I know which transactions will be included in the next block. 
Can I infer from it what will be the blockhash of the next block?
undefined says Personally, I don't think so.
undefined says hash couldn't be controlled
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsPlease help him if you have time, thank you
undefined says I do not quite understand you. But talk about Arbitrum as far as I understand it.
undefined says well, the way a blockhash is created is by taking the previous blockhash + all transactions of the current block + block number and such and create from everything a hash which will be the block hash
undefined says so I'm just wondering, if that means that someone who knows all this information can infer from advanced what will be the block hash
undefined says Arbitrum nodes are divided into validators and sequencers. Validators validate nodes, confirming which transaction is correct. The sequencer is responsible for ordering the blocks.
undefined says I understand, I will send a document and you will understand after reading it.
undefined says yeah so the sequencer is in charge of creating the blocks no?
undefined says unless you control the sequencer because there are timestamp, nonce etc. in the block header
undefined says So 2 follow up questions:

1. if I'm the sequencer (I know that it is centralized right now but in the future it will be decentralized), can I infer (or basically decide) what will be the block hash as I can control which transactions will be included in the block?
2. If I'm not the sequencer but I guess which transaction/s will be included in the block and what will be the timestamp, can I guess what will be the block hash?
undefined says 1. yes, but you can't control it easily because that's still a hash
2. if you have the block header the hash is deterministic
undefined says ok, last follow up question.

Would you recommend building a guessing game on Arbitrum where users can guess what will be a number in 2 blocks ahead that this number is calculated from the blockhash (of 2 blocks ahead)?
undefined says I feel like on Ethereum it will be extremely hard for a miner to do it. But I love Arbitrum and really want to use it.
undefined says please refer to this :https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#if-the-sequencer-is-well-behaved
undefined says you cannot get L2 blockhash (i.e. what you see on Arbiscan) on-chain; if you use the blockhash(x) op, we return arb l1 blockhash instead (see: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/solidity_support), which is a hash of L1 block number and state of the inbox (i.e. not what u see on etherscan)
undefined says hmmm
undefined says so basically blockhash(10001,10002,10003,10004...) will return the same blockhash until a new block is minded on Ethereum?
undefined says blockhash(block.number) would return the same blockhash until a new block is mined on Ethereum AND RELAYED BY THE SEQUENCER
undefined says oh I understand now
undefined says Do you have any idea how to achieve this functionality on Arbitrum?
undefined says assuming you need on-chain randomness, we currently don't have a well known VRF solution deployed yet; MAGIC have a Randomizer contract that you can try if you need on-chain randomness now https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8e79c8607a28fe1ec3527991c89f1d9e36d1bad9
undefined says testnet https://testnet.arbiscan.io/address/0xdec6641458eef4f7fe70101e77935d4e9d431f64
undefined says thanks, but I'm pretty sure they are controlling the VRF
undefined says so it is not really random, I mean, it is random but we need to trust them
undefined says ya we hope the get an actual VRF up soon but no eta
undefined says We don’t have such a docs, but you can see those code which has the rpc information: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-rpc-node/web3 , also, almost all the l1 rpc we support but a few about the pow.
undefined says Hi, sorry if this has been asked here many times before, I'm fairly new to this. Is the simplest way to listen to the Sequencer output to connect to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed? And if so, how do I deserialise those messages?
undefined says Seems Datacursor is the main data structure to receive the receipt data from arb-os? @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says When connecting to the Sequencer websocket I receive data in the format:
"{"lastSequenceNumber":27034304,"accumulator":[102,105,195,121,212,24,19,146,181,255,236,105,234,196,174,30,61,137,166,219,5,66,247,49,167,150,248,80,79,253,217,127],"totalDelayedCount":486834,"sequencerMessage":"A6SxCsYeeeoeFQ33C43aUzkZKP0UAAAAAA...."

Do you have any docs on the meaning of the accumulator numbers, or how to decode the sequencerMessage? Or a link to some code that does the decoding?
undefined says what are the recommended machine specs for running an arbitrum node?
undefined says https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413938850075-What-s-the-hardware-requirements-to-run-the-full-node-
undefined says anyone have experience running a node on 4 cores?
undefined says or is this mainly a RAM consideration?
undefined says RAM and CPU usage is tied to the frequency and type of requests handled.  You will just have to try a given configuration out, and increase specs if you run out of RAM or available CPU.
undefined says Any suggestions on how to decode the sequencerMessage? Thanks
undefined says Hi Team, I would like to download the release-version build node directly, e.g. https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/releases/tag/v1.4.0
undefined says But he's not a git project and I can't download the submodule using the command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
undefined says I don't want to git clone master checkout because it's too big
undefined says Can someone tell me how to build releases?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs @gzeon | Offchain Labs   hi,Can you help me?
undefined says Hi, I guess what you don’t understand is the `accumulator` and `preAcc`, those two are the sequencer’s blockchain network state’s accumulator. Which can be used to verify the state. And it type is bytes32.
undefined says Hello team, is there an API for Arbitrum ?
undefined says Yup, you can use it as l1 way, we support l1’s json rpc.
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Hi Jason, thank you for the response. How about the 'SequencerMessage' string? How would I decode that, and does it encode all the information on each submitted transaction, (i..e the method called and the call data used)?

Or maybe I'm misunderstanding what information is available from the sequencer feed.
undefined says Do we have any vedio toturials to check
undefined says https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API
undefined says This is `sequencerMessage’ struct: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-util/inbox/inboxMessage.go#L56
undefined says Here is the code base may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-util/broadcaster/broadcaster.go
undefined says Hi, anyone knows what's wrong with my arbitrum node?
undefined says Hi, you can change a 3rd part rpc service to try.
undefined says hi, why everytime I restart the node, the checkpoint begin from 0. Is there a way to set checkpoint to help sync faster? Does checkpoint start from 0 means it will sync from the beginning?
undefined says Currently we don’t provide the way to faster the restart for security reasons, but we will improve this after nitro upgrade.
undefined says Thank you! actually I use my own eth rpc, let me try restart it.
undefined says Hi
undefined says Hi. When i do an ERC20 deposit via erc20 bridge, who calls the finalizaInboundTransfer() on L2 gateway? I believe the code is somewhere on arb-os? Could you tell me which function calls the L2 finalizeInboundTransfer()? Thx!
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#transaction-receipts @gzeon | Offchain Labs Do you know how arbos emit the log to arbnode? It seems not use RPC
undefined says The retryable ticket‘s auto redeem will call.
undefined says You can see the related information here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#retryable-transaction-lifecycle
undefined says Sequencer will feed this information to others arbitrum node, then user can call `eth_getTransactionReceipt` to this node to get this receipt information.
undefined says How about call "arbtrace_replayTransaction" to get trace? The local arbos reexecute the transaction and the Sequencer boardcast to other node?
undefined says I wonder to know who will receive the emit trace? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/doc/TracingData.md#emitting-trace-info-as-debugprints
undefined says did you mount the docker volume to persistant storage?
undefined says the trace is returned in the `arbtrace_replayTransaction` RPC call
undefined says Yeah, but I want to know who will receive Arbos emit trace?
undefined says I am not sure what you mean, whoever call the rpc method would receive it
undefined says I mean the AVM or the Arb-node, who will receive the emit trace from Arbos? Because seems arbos emit the trace like AVM assembly?
undefined says I'm having some issues with some differences in the EVM and AVM behavior ( @gzeon | Offchain Labs  are you around?)
undefined says yes
undefined says great! sending with a DM
undefined says can i activate `--node.rpc.tracing.enable` on the fly without resetting the node? @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs  is there an admin console on runtime?
undefined says none of the node settings are dynamically loaded, so no
undefined says Hi, the validator won’t forward the state on l2, it only stakes a state which they think is right. The sequencer will forward the state because it can order the tx. When sequencer order the tx and send the tx batch to l1, everyone can read the tx data on l1, and re-execute those tx to get the right state if they are honest. But some fullnodes may execute to a wrong state for some reasons, so the validators will stake on a right state they think(, or they want to cheat and stake on the wrong stake). Also, if a fraud proof happens, it won’t affect to a honest tx, this docs may help you: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says Fraud proofs submitted by validators do not affect layer 2 execution.  The only thing that can happen is withdrawals to layer 1 can be delayed.
undefined says :arbiflame:
undefined says THis summer is layer 2, right? haha
undefined says where can i find the disputable assertion hash pre-image format?
undefined says This repo can help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/test
undefined says sorry to be more clear, I'm looking for how this hash (`ExecutionHash.machineHash`) is constructed https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/RollupLib.sol#L45
undefined says This test file shows how to create a rollup contract: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/1b1c05cdcadfba5271ae62cfb0b88f787381f406/packages/arb-bridge-eth/test/arbRollup.spec.ts#L327. And this input the machine, you can see this examples.
undefined says Is there block gasLimit on Arbitrum? Could a block have more than one tx?
undefined says We have 2.3m arbgas(computational) limit for each tx. One block can contain more than 1 tx.
undefined says 2.3m is enough? 15m-30m in mainnet.
undefined says This is arbgas, which is different from l1 gas.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#gas-and-fees
undefined says you can pull the docker image
undefined says Why are all the blocks validated by null address in Arbiscan?
undefined says when going from L1->L2 for erc20, I see that gas estimation is done for L2 network as well. why is there no gas estimatino process when going from L2->L1? is it because outbox is executed seperately? It still seems like there should be some gas needed around sending msg to L1 outbox. i'm curious
undefined says one more ques. when doing withdraw, what data is in params.overrides? is it usually empty {}? or are there important data inside?

Referring to this in erc20bridger.withdrawTxOrGas() ->        return (estimate ? l2GatewayRouter.estimateGas : l2GatewayRouter.functions)['outboundTransfer(address,address,uint256,bytes)'](params.erc20l1Address, to, params.amount, '0x', params.overrides || {});
undefined says Hi, this is because l1-> l2 tx will auto execute when your tx arrive on l2. But for l2-> l1, your tx won’t execute automatically, you need send the claim tx by your self, so your gas cost will paid when you send that claim tx. And for token transfer, that data is usually empty, because we will process it by our gateway.
undefined says I see. thx!
undefined says Currently developing a dapp - when I use eth_getLogs through the official RPC endpoint on arb1 I get the following error: 

"JsonRpcEngine: Response has no error or result for request:\n{\n  \"method\": \"eth_getLogs\.  [....]""

It works on arbitrum-rinkeby. 
Any idea why?
undefined says Hey, not sure if this the right channel for such questions, but I stumbled upon this strange transaction 0x1d76d3d13e9f8cc713d484b0de58edd279c4c62e46e963899aec28eb648b5800 which seems to be part of two blocks with more than 12 hours between them. See https://arbiscan.io/txs?block=4527955 and https://arbiscan.io/txs?block=4512673 What really went on with this transaction? Is it actually part of both blocks, and how would I go about obtaining the transaction receipts for the transaction from both blocks?
undefined says Did you make this transaction
undefined says No, but it's breaking some script I have. So I'd like to understand what is going on
undefined says Same calldata was executed after 12 hours?
undefined says Sorry, I'm going to ask a very clumsy question. I will donate to github, but there are different projects, which ones do you think are more beneficial for airdrop as github arbitrum?
undefined says Hey guys, I run a crypto education channel where we explain blockchain fundamentals with easy explanations. Right know we are researching everything for the Layer 2 explanation video and we have some important questions regarding the mechanisms of L2's, we would love to talk with someone from the Arbitrum team to clear up the questions. Who can we reach out to?
undefined says Hello Arbitrum team! could you please add a "latest" tag to the `arb-node`  container published on docker hub ? https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/arb-node/tags
undefined says I'm working on NiceNode and would like the app to always pull the latest image just using `docker pull offchainlabs/arb-node`, Created a github issue https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/issues/2270
undefined says Im working on a SocialFi project . My team are very positive that this project will draw the next hype on SocialFi. We are exploring a chain to launch the project.
It would be great to partner with your chain on this project. Would you be able share more on how we can get listed on your chain?
undefined says Hi, just trying to find out if FSS is live already or still in development? I asked in #💬︱general but this channel is probably more appropriate?
undefined says What does it mean by `keccak256(zeroPad(retryable-ticket-id), 0)`. If the ticket id is 0x0375F1 then it is just `keccak256(0x0375F1)`?
undefined says Any plans for creating a testnet based on Kiln https://kiln.themerge.dev/ ?
undefined says what's wrong with Arbitrum RPC?
undefined says Your request rate is under limit, you can try 3rd part rpc service.
undefined says Here is how to get this data: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/master/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L176
undefined says Not live on arbitrum yet.
undefined says Hi, you can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Does Arbitrum support development chain?（Similar to ethereum）
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says You mean a local blockchain?
undefined says We have not opened  this yet.
undefined says OK
undefined says It seems there is some confusion, here: retryable-ticket-id is different from the message number in Arbiscan. It seems just retryable tx hash on L2.  I can get the tx hash of L2_TX(type=0) and AUTO_REDEEM(type=1): 
```
const retryableTxId = "0xb9b930df2bf00c9630503ad5ba35b48186a763d9b6f60406cc77243d9471c3b9";
const l2TxnType = 0;
const b = utils.zeroPad(BigNumber.from(l2TxnType).toHexString(), 32);
const c = utils.concat([retryableTxId,b]);
const v = utils.keccak256(c);
```
undefined says @admin, is onboarding process on Arbitrum ordyssey still ongoing?
undefined says retryable-ticket-id needed to be calculated like this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/master/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L157 . Also, you can see the docs here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#transaction-types--terminology
undefined says Ordyssey will start on mid June.
undefined says When I signed to broadcast a transaction, the following error occurred
undefined says {
    "id": 21,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": null,
    "error": {
        "code": -32000,
        "message": "invalid chain id for signer",
        "data": null
    },
    "rawResponse": null,
    "transactionHash": null
}
undefined says When you sign this tx, is your chain id same to the network you want to send this tx?
undefined says yes,My signature is added to the chain
undefined says Now it can broadcast successfully
undefined says Thanks dude. Is the plan to have every tx on arbitrum run through fss, or is it an optional add-on that dapps can use?
undefined says You can pay more attention to our announcement in the future.
undefined says 😐
undefined says We haven’t announced the details about fss with arbitrum network yet, but once we decide it, we will let you know.
undefined says 😁
undefined says my eth arbitrum can not deposit layer 2? can you help me sir?
undefined says here sir it is pending ?
undefined says for help you need to send full tx link
undefined says Does `L1ToL2MessageGasEstimator.estimateRetryableTicketMaxGas` show total gas for both createRetryable ticket and executing L2 tx?
I use it as maxGas for sending L1 to L2 message but the tx failed. After increasing maxGas to some enough value, it works(both of them have same gasPriceBid).
undefined says Happy to open a pr for this if possible:)
undefined says That  function is used to estimate the cost of putting a message in the L2 inbox that is reexecuted. For l1 tx, you need to use `eth_estimateGas`
undefined says This pending is because the miner hasn’t accepted your tx. You need to wait when the network gas price is lower, and your will will be included.
undefined says Are "Rollup-chain" and "Arbitrum chain" same thing? Which one does Arbiscan show?
undefined says There are sequencer chain and rollup chain on arbitrum network. Sequencer chain is maintenances by sequencer, which you can see this on arbiscan. Rollups chain is used to stake the network’s state and protect the funds transfer back to l1.
undefined says Ah, I see. "challenge" occurs on "rollup-chain", am I right?
undefined says Yup
undefined says how can I use the node bootstrap snapshots when  I'm running the docker image? can't find where to put the data files
undefined says /home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node#putting-it-all-together
undefined says im running in deamon mode with `sudo docker run -d -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum-mainnet/:/home/ubuntu/.arbitrum/mainnet`, no `-it` no `--rm`. I cannot find any data in my `/home/ubuntu/arbitrum-mainnet/`, which is weird
undefined says You just need to copy the snapshot to that dictionary and run the command that I sent you in the website.
undefined says k thx, letme try it
undefined says thanks, it was my bad, it works now
undefined says --node.rpc.tracing.enable @gzeon | Offchain Labs  I can use these option to get trace when I ran the arb node?
undefined says yes
undefined says the rpc methods `arbtrace_transaction` and `arbtrace_block` will be available once you enabled the flag
undefined says hola folks - attempting to run a node via docker, have used the public snapshot db (to march), seems to be incredibly slow to sync, not sure it's ever going to catch up 🙂 on a fast connection, nvme storage etc, no problems iwth the underlying geth on the machine
undefined says any tips anyone can share please? 🙂
undefined says But I get these error “error creating execution cursor” in return when I use RPC
undefined says we discovered some tracing issue with 1.4.0 arb-node which is fixed in 1.4.1
undefined says seems I need this "--core.cache.timed-expire" to add the data valid time?
undefined says I don’t think you need
undefined says But when I request the block that has been executed long time ago,  I would get “error creating execution cursor” the error, but recent executed block do not
undefined says Tracing needs archive database, see https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says Your storage volume needs low latency, preferably less than 100us as measured by ioping
undefined says cheers - it's in the 60-100 range - I think (based on #support) there's no fix to this, it's just slow.
undefined says is there documentation how to setup a local arbitrum/nitro chain for testing purposes?
undefined says try without the first word, the greeting, in your message
undefined says why doesn't arbitrum nitro need to run WASM-compiled geth in normal execution (only in fraud proofs)? don't you need to do so to generate the disputable assertion?
undefined says In nitro the first step of a challenge is a block challenge, so we only need to have the global state instead of the vm state. https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/proving/ChallengeManager.md
The disputable assertion is just a block hash (and a bit of other metadata like inbox position), which can be generated by the native node without running wasm.
undefined says right that makes total sense thanks
undefined says but also doesn't L1 need to be told how much "gas" in terms of the wasm trace is used to arbitrate bisection, and how would you compute that without instrumenting the wasm instructions? (is there a different notion of gas between the wasm trace and evm's?)

sorry if that's poorly worded / doesn't make sense
undefined says we compile it into wasm, its still the same code with the same gas accounting
undefined says I want to run my own rpc node. How much disk space does the node need?
undefined says I think about 1.3TB?
undefined says me too. What are the ram and cpu specs we need?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/983797429071659049
undefined says okey found the ram, cpu specs
undefined says how about the disk space
undefined says Wondering how I can parse the input data from a transaction like this (posting arbitrum txs to mainnet) calling `addSequencerL2BatchFromOriginWithGasRefunder`. I want to get an array of transaction hashes/objects. I can see it takes a `transactions` argument, but not sure how to parse it.
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3ddffe77b9b0121992c71f92da3fd9597df3fa6e1d2130d667b288feb796199a
undefined says Is there a good way to bootstrap a local arbitrum instance? similar to how zkSync has it setup: https://v2-docs.zksync.io/api/hardhat/testing.html#local-testing
undefined says We have param explanations here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L219
undefined says We haven’t opened this tutorial yet. But you can test it directly on our testnet also.
undefined says It’s absolutely enough.
undefined says More than 300gb. But the state is increasing by time, so you can prepare a large one.
undefined says Ah ok, when do you think local dev will be ready?
undefined says Not sure yet
undefined says eth full node (~1.4TB) + arbitrum (~400GB). Right?
undefined says Not sure the exact number of ethereum fullnode, but for arbitrum is ok.
undefined says how are u
undefined says hey dev , I sent USDC to USDC contract by mistake , can you please recover it ?
undefined says not possible
undefined says There is no way to recover if you send the wrong contract address
undefined says its not a wrong address ,its the official USDC contract
undefined says hash - 0x7efbafb56c12f4e54d9ef819dcf4a8f1ff2cefd6f5012b045f2272ad6d8345ff
undefined says txs can't be undone
undefined says As ben said, it’s impossible to recover that since tx can’t be canceled once it confirmed.
undefined says ok , I needed that money badly , sad 😦
undefined says Anyone can be a sequencer without staking, right? Is there any possibility that the sequencer ignore(or censor) some messages in delayed inbox?
undefined says Not right, currently only offchain labs run the sequencer. But we will introduce decentralized sequencer in the future.
undefined says hay frens
undefined says i have a question here
What are the risks of "the merge" and in case of bugs/problem with that, how it could affect Arbitrum?
undefined says It might have some missing blocks on ethereum when merge, but won’t too much, so will not affect arbitrum too much. However, the actual situation is still subject to the time of the merger, and we will keep an eye on the network status at the time of the merger.
undefined says I personally think the biggest risk of the merger is the security of the assets on the ethereal chain and contract security, and because arb's data is stored on the ethereal chain, if it is serious it will also affect Arb, but so far the merge is going smoothly and slowly,  happy to hear that
undefined says 1
undefined says Can anybody tell me the gas of ariturm is much less than eth mainnet？
undefined says 1/10
undefined says check here ser https://l2fees.info/
undefined says ok，thanks a lot
undefined says Thankss fren
undefined says Hey gents! My node crashed and after restarting it seems to just sit like this. Is this normal?:

undefined says are you guys able to update the snapshot? current one is for march and takes super long to sync
undefined says how can i get the submissionPrice when i try to deposit ETH from L1 to arbitrum?
undefined says call `GetSubmissionPrice`  from `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006E`  with the parametersEncode `createRetryableTicket(address destAddr, uint256 l2CallValue, uint256 maxSubmissionCost, address excessFeeRefundAddress, address callValueRefundAddress, uint256 maxGas, uint256 gasPriceBid, bytes data)`?
undefined says Nope, here shows how we create retryable ticket, you can follow this code: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/master/src/lib/message/L1ToL2MessageCreator.ts#L73
undefined says also https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/greeter/scripts/exec.js#L97
undefined says What is the correct CodePoint pair  
pair { CurrentOpCode , Hash(**NextOpCode**) }
OR
pair { CurrentOpCode , Hash(**NextCodePoint**) }
undefined says The second one, related docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#codepoints-optimizing-code-for-proving
undefined says could you point me to a document about how arbitrum rollup works? i mean, what and how many data  is packed and rolled up to L1 and such? In  rollup document in website (arbitrum rollup basics, specs- arbitrum rollup protocol), its mostly about how its dispute system works well, and not about rollup process itself
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol ser check if this would be help to you?
undefined says thanks. i was looking at this as well. it explains clearly about how the protocol makes sure bad actor doesn't benefit, but doesn't explain how or which part of data is compressed and rolled up to L1 onchain. could you help me locate that part? thx!
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbitrum-rollup-protocol here explain the rollup works.
undefined says that's what i was looking for. thanks!
undefined says glad to help lol
undefined says Then how will the AVM state move, Codepoint is included in state after every instruction execution

If we go by second pair, to form the current codepoint thus state we need the next codepoint but building the next codepoint will again the next to next codepoint n so on
undefined says AVM has execution and proving functions. For execution (which is used to promote the state), we just use the standard instructions array. And codepointer is used to prove, for this creation: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#creating-code-at-runtime
undefined says why i got this error?
undefined says why?
undefined says According to the error message, it should be that the amount is too small and is identified as `NO VALUE`
undefined says but my msg.value is not zero. should not raise this error.
undefined says This code needs your msg.value to be 0.
undefined says oh，i see. my bad
undefined says Thanks for your sharing and corrections. :arbitrum:
undefined says the msg.value is required when i bridge asset from L1 to L2
undefined says yes, only for L1 -> L2 not L2 -> L1
undefined says What is the attack vector reason for setting 2.4m gas limit and why does nitro get rid of this attack vector?
undefined says Does this mean nitro adopts eip1559?
undefined says The blockchain is single-threaded, so we can't keep a dapp running all the time.  So there will be a computational limit to a single transaction.  This will not be canceled in nitro, but the limit is higher.
undefined says Nitro won‘t burn eth, but the way we charge gas price will be very similar to eip1559, if the tx number higher, the base fee will be higher, vice versa.
undefined says is there an analytic method you can share with us about how this is calculated?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#price-for-arbgas
undefined says From the official doc, it says that any validator can produce rollups block (i'm guessing it writes a tx on L1). what's the benefit for the validator to write tx itself? because it costs gas to write any tx on L1. are they getting any reward?
undefined says fren you can look at this https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/985875891039117322
undefined says I see. so, even though any validator can produce rollups block, at least right now its almost always the whitelisted validator who is producing the rollup block. is this correct to assume? thx!
undefined says yes,you get it.
undefined says The sequencer produces rollup blocks, validators validate rollup blocks
undefined says Both will be rewarded. for more information, please refer to #🧠︱faq : Protocol FAQ
undefined says Is there any API provider available for User Holdings and Gas Price Calculation for Arbitrum Mainnet?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#price-for-arbgas you could check this buddy.
undefined says 
undefined says why i cant post this 🙂
undefined says You should have triggered some words like "h el lo"
undefined says yes the h e l lo is the problem
undefined says how can I find my rpc url on my arbitrum node? or how can I connect to my node
undefined says You might want to check out the tutorial.
https://github.com/arbitrum-cn/Arbitrum-Library/tree/main/rpc-tutorials
undefined says Here is the port information: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node#important-ports
undefined says thanks @clipe (will NEVER DM you)
undefined says You can just send eth-rpc request: eth_gasPrice to our rpc node.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Thank you. Following you, a lot of technical questions and answers can be collected.
undefined says IP:8547 worked thanks again
undefined says If the gas price mechanism is similar to eip1559 but eth isn't burned, where does it go then?
undefined says Does it go to the network fee account?
undefined says What is the base fee determined by the aggregator (right now the sequencer run by offchain labs)
undefined says Currently Arbitrum One has a centralized sequencer
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#sequencer-mode
There are plans for decentralizing everything, but currently no set date.
undefined says thats not really answering my question
undefined says I read that sequencer only works when in sequencer mode. what happens when there is no sequencer? who produces rollup blocks then?
undefined says Sorry, waiting for an answer from a team member.
undefined says The content of this document should help you.
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#sequencer-mode
undefined says It’s collected by the network.
undefined says Currently the price is 1/100 of the l1 network. And if the network usage goes up, the fee goes up. But  this is the minimum number, and price will never lower than this. But if the price higher than this minimum number, when network usage goes down, the price will go down.
undefined says Wonderful thanks for answering our questions Jason, @0xEvan and I are writing a paper for a conference and are grateful for your time.
undefined says Hope it's not a trouble we will likely have more
undefined says Always happy to help!
undefined says i'm looking for something like owlracle.info
undefined says Don’t know if there is one, but rpc way is the most recommended.
undefined says is there plans to get the eth_syncing rpc method added to the current arb-node?
undefined says I believe not
undefined says havent checked yet but will it be in the nitro node?
undefined says and thanks for the answer anyway! 🙂
undefined says not supported yet but there is plan to add support
undefined says thank you, much appreciated
undefined says Is there any doc for running a local arbitrum network? I found that in the official doc, it is under construction.
undefined says not for classic but you can use https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash to setup a local nitro env with a local L1
undefined says What about a ddos attack? Does having a gas limit prevent someone to ddos the network to censor other users from trying to complete transactions for multiple blocks? How does the gas limit get enforced by ArbOS?

Doesn't ArbGas get retired once nitro comes out? If so, then does that change how ArbOS meters gas usage?
undefined says From my research, and please correct me if I'm wrong, the offchain labs sequencer recieves transactions on a FIFO basis. 

The "mempool"  is dictated by the gas limit and computational limits of the single threaded sequencer node. Block sizes can be arbitrarily large so by having a hard gas limit, this also caps the block size.

However if an adversary wanted to spam transactions to the sequencer at incrementally higher fees (second price fee mechanism allows for more efficient floor spamming prices), what's stopping them from doing that?


My understanding is that this is not possible because ArbOS monitors gas usage and this metering service can shut down anyone who exceeds their gas usage (such as someone attempting to DDOS the network).
undefined says will ArbOS still be used once the sequencer is decentralized by Chainlink?

Conversely, for Chainlink's fair sequence servicing to be successfully leveraged on Arbitrum, it would have to have compatibility with ArbOS right?
undefined says the attacker would have to pay for the gas, you can do the same in L1 by buying all the block space
undefined says Right.

So then given the gas limit, that is the cost to buy an entire arbitrum block then. That sounds very economically viable for an adversary. Am I missing something here?
undefined says My question is if an adversary buys entire arbitrum blocks by ddosing the network with transactions, what is the defense? Is there any?
undefined says A congestion fee will be charged to discourage such attack when the gas pool is depleting
undefined says So the problem I guess isn't "how to prevent attack", but rather "how long can an attack be sustained for"?
undefined says which is true? blocks made by validator or sequencer? this text below is from official doc which says validator propose blocks @fish @xiaoming（will never DM you） 
"Validators can propose rollup blocks. New rollup blocks will be unresolved at first. Eventually every rollup block will be resolved, by being either confirmed or rejected. The confirmed blocks make up the confirmed history of the chain."
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/966267238116122634
undefined says is this document (linked below) still accurate? is the arbitrum architecture conceptually different from this link? I am trying to understand the architecture as a whole and this link would be helpful if it holds (along with official doc ofcourse)
https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec
undefined says This is same to l1, we just need to let an attacker to pay the high cost to prevent they attack.
undefined says If you want to know about the arbitrum architecture, this docs will be better: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says I see. I am reading the official doc (which u linked) as well. however, it is a pretty deep dive document so i wanted to get a whole picture before diving into it haha. will read into it. thx!
undefined says doesn't ddos/censorship attacks get cheaper on l2 compared to l1 due to cheaper gas?
undefined says the cost will increase under sustained load or when under attack
undefined says we charge an increasing congestion fee
undefined says yea you're referring to this right?

https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#price-for-arbgas

Similar to EIP-1559 in that the price for blockspace rises when there is more demand (congestion) for the blockspace.
undefined says yes
undefined says Yes the cost will increase, but isn't the base cost going to be much cheaper on l2 compared to l1?

My understanding is that the congestion fee increases at about the same rate as implemented in EIP1559 so if the base cost to buy entire arbitrum blocks is less expensive, then the overall base cost to censor other users will be less overall too
undefined says It’s not the same rate and even if it is the cost will eventually raise to a point that is financially infeasible to deploy such an attack
undefined says oh my bad, it's the same bounds (7/8, 9/8) which doesn't imply same rate. Would you say rate is faster or slower compared to EIP-1559?
undefined says since we have much shorter block time I believe the rate would be much faster
undefined says that makes sense
undefined says Hii
undefined says 🤟
undefined says Can I say anything?
undefined says The Arbitrum Sequencer contract on ethereum... who is paying for that?
undefined says the gas cost
undefined says according to etherscan its has used almost 7000 ETH by now
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/894570830493790238
undefined says Users do via l2 gas aka arbgas- the protocol disperses fees to  compensate various different parties / costs appropriately (the sequencer, validators, etc)
undefined says Thanks for the info. Does it always match up with the current gas fees? If ethereum fees are up then arbgas will also go up?
undefined says yup,arb's gas fee will be affected by ethereum
undefined says Is there any tutorial how to create a nft collection on arbitrum?
undefined says https://arbazaar.io/create/ you are saying this?
undefined says thanks bro, I will take a look
undefined says I think it's not what I am looking for
undefined says Can you describe your thoughts in detail? i can check for you
undefined says I want to create a minting page for nfts and I am looking for tutorial how to create smart contract on arbitrum etc.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/tutorials here you can find what you want.
undefined says thanks
undefined says hey! not sure if this is the right channel, but I wanted to know how I can get NFT data by account addresses (and not by contract addresses) ?
undefined says We have a smart contract deployed on Nitro that emits events in response to certain interactions.  We then have a server that listens to these events.  At around 9:40am we noticed the server started picking up all the previous events that the smart contract had emitted.

Is nitro reset, and events replated every so often? Or could it be something else? We're trying to figure it out 🙂
undefined says Guys I am following the guide on how to run my own node.  But every time I stop and restart the node it has to sync all over again?  I don't see it using any disk space also
undefined says I am using this command docker run --rm -it  -v /home/vmware/arbitrum/dir2/:/home/vmware/arbitrum/dir3 -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.0-f4bbe91 --l1.url http://192.168.0.231:8545
undefined says where the 192....231 IP is my ethereum full node
undefined says i am really looking to run a permanent full node, like I run geth and it syncs to chain-tip after 2 days...
undefined says did you run `chmod -fR 777 /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet` in the directory you made?
undefined says I'm assuming Linux
undefined says https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
undefined says you're mounting the volume to the wrong location. the volume specification should look like `/home/vmware/arbitrum/dir2/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet`
undefined says but I don't have a /home/user/ directory, so can't I use /home/vmware/arbitrum/dir3 ?
undefined says oooohhh I think /home/user/ is insider the docker?
undefined says correct
undefined says and it's a mapping
undefined says doh!  thank you!
undefined says :PES_BlankieThumbsUp:
undefined says what's the reason for the "--rm" flag?  I don't want to delete  because I plan to run this node permanently
undefined says --rm                             Automatically remove the container
                                       when it exits
undefined says this would remove the container. it's more for automatic housekeeping. removing the container will not remove the state which will be stored in the mounted volume
undefined says Missed that 😋 good looks.
undefined says thank you sooo much for explaining.  Last question, it seems like I have to run it with 'sudo'.  Is that correct?  Without sudo, it gets an error: docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/create": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
undefined says Your account needs to be part of the docker group
undefined says sudo usermod -aG username docker
undefined says thanks!!
undefined says Thanks for your information, can you provide your contract address and your topic Id?
undefined says The nft’s metadata is one of the nft contract’s state, and not the state of the owner’s state, so you should call to the nft’s contract.
undefined says :arbjak:
undefined says 💯
undefined says according to https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/solidity_support, tx.gasprice returns the gas bid placed by the user, not the actual arbgas price used in the transaction.
Is there a way to access the final arb gas price in a contract?
undefined says is there any blockchain snapshot file for faster sync?
undefined says According to the news on the channel, this is the latest
Mainnet:

undefined says what is the specific structure of proof in arb? Is it related to MPT-Proof?
undefined says Is there any details I can learn，thks！
undefined says When can claim my bridging NFT?
undefined says what is the specific structure of proof in arb? Is it related to MPT-Proof?
undefined says You can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L17, and the 5th return value is what you want. Also, here is the address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says The proof you describe here is consensus algorithm？
undefined says You mean odyssey bridge week’s nft? It has not started yet, see: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085189823266875/987501507660349460
undefined says I mean the “ interactive fraud proof”
undefined says 
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#interactive-proving
undefined says I download the snapshot, and it stuck this message. Is it normal?
undefined says If I use empty db, it will sync normally.
undefined says That is normal.  Depending on the latency of you drive, it can take 20 minutes (modern NVMe) to many hours (hard drive)
undefined says There's a `ethhash2` for 8 arbgas units specified in https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification
Is this the Ethash? https://ethereum.org/es/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining-algorithms/ethash/
Since keccak and sha2 cost way more, wanted to understand of ethhash2 is collision resistant or what it is.
undefined says I am using brownie to interact with contracts on the arbitrum mainnet, when I send a tx, `tx.wait(1)` 's sometimes takes forever and then send back `429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc` error
undefined says Helb please
undefined says I am not able to text anything here as it says it contains blocked content.. is there a better way to ask longer questions somewhere..
undefined says You can't type "H and I" together here lmao
undefined says Ou wow that was it then haha thanks for the help I will try again..
undefined says :CatKiss:
undefined says Magic haha
undefined says Definitely keeps the standard scam messages away
undefined says Hello! I have a question about this early return: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/transaction_streamer.go#L478-L480

Doesn't this (and similarly a few returns in the rest of the function) break the "one l1 message <-> one l2 block" mapping? It seems the block is produced but due to the early return not necessarily persisted (this only happens here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/transaction_streamer.go#L523)
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs would you be open to reviewing our formalization of the Arbitrum fee calculations in our paper?
undefined says Is there a governance forum like on OP?
undefined says https://www.reddit.com/r/Arbitrum/
https://research.arbitrum.io/
undefined says I guess brownie just read the l1’s block number of arbitrum network, and the l1’s block number update every one minute like this: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum#example , so the time period is large caused this error.
undefined says You can see here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#gas-and-fees , if you have any further questions, you can ask me.
undefined says The first code link is to the sequencer's code. The sequencer's input isn't L1 messages, it's RPC transactions coming in over the internet. The sequencer is free to decide to not make a block if none of the transactions succeed.
undefined says what happens when multiple(2 or more) Makeblocks Validator makes same rollup blocks at the same time? does 2 rollup block with same data (except for current block no) gets created? or is it somehow checked before?
undefined says ethhash2 is basically a special-casing for when you want to hash 64-byte strings. That's used a bunch inside of ArbOS but I believe you can't deploy a contract to use it directly.
undefined says It will be created with different node number.
undefined says How long does it normally take to synchronize data on the Arbitrum network?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says 
undefined says It's been about 5 days since the sync and I'm not sure if this is normal
undefined says Is it possible to get transaction debug traces? Can someone point me to the relevant docs please?
undefined says Machine configuration is aws **r5d.2xlarge**
undefined says You should run a node with  --node.rpc.tracing.enable: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node#optional-parameters
undefined says You already sync to 42%, you can estimate the days.
undefined says Yes, I just want to know if this sync time is normal , for hardware** r5d.2xlarge**
undefined says it hard to say, around 10-12 days.
undefined says ok
undefined says then which is the right block? e.g. Validator1 creates Block2 (prev block 1), Validator2 creates Block3(prev block 1). both blocks are right blocks. which block should be confirmed&resolved at then end of dispute period? 
and if another validator tries to create Block4, will the prev block be 2 or 3?
undefined says The first one created is right
undefined says so the second one(Block 3 from above)  is created but will be rejected?
undefined says I read the instance recommendation is z1d.2xlarge just wondering if it gonna be good until nitro is out?
undefined says Not sure about the current DB size so just want to make sure 300gb is enough til the upgrade
undefined says 300gb might run a bit tight if you run a archive node
undefined says archive mainnet arbitrum node is ~250gb now
undefined says Thanks! And what is the flag to run a full node instead of an archive node?
undefined says `--core.checkpoint-prune-on-startup --core.database.compact --core.database.exit-after`
undefined says Test
undefined says Not sure why my message was auto modded
undefined says Are there any examples for using the arbitrum bridge via code?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says It's mentioned that the gas cost is estimated by the aggregator, can someone clearly explain how this is estimated or point me to the right repository so i can find this? is this part of the arb os repository?
undefined says Starting soon we'll be sharing out more frequent technical updates on an Arbitrum Developer specific twitter, so please follow here to keep up to date: https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#fees
undefined says You have sent this to me several times. If it answered my questions i wouldn't be asking them. It does not provide much mathematical analysis and very little analytical quantification.
undefined says closest thing that i can abstract to it is this paper. https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10567
undefined says The price for arbgas is determined by the network congestion, the calculation way is: The mechanism is inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-1559, which uses a base price that, at the beginning of each block, is multiplied by a factor between 7/8 and 9/8, depending on how busy the chain seems to be. When the demand seems to be exceeding supply, the factor will be more than 1; when supply exceeds demand, the factor will be less than 1.
undefined says that is not my question. I have read this many times. it's word for word in the docs you keep sending.
undefined says It's okay i'll dig through the repository, and figure it out myself.
undefined says And sequencer is the only aggregator on arbitrum network
undefined says I know, its in the docs...
undefined says Which version of the EVM does Arbitrum support?
undefined says On, arbitrum, we use AVM rather than evm, here is avm’s sprcific: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification
undefined says Thanks - I mean if I'm compiling Solidity to deploy on Arbitrum which EVM version should I select? (homestead, tangerineWhistle, spuriousDragon, byzantium, constantinople, petersburg, istanbul or berlin)
undefined says Checking
undefined says Actually I was able to deploy Berlin EVM to Arbitrum Testnet back in January and it worked great. Now I can deploy to the testnet, but I can't send a tx to the contract.
undefined says What errors response? Or no response?
undefined says Metamask says this: We were not able to estimate gas. There might be an error in the contract and this transaction may fail.
undefined says If I proceed anyway I get:

https://github.com/acuity-social/acuity-atomic-swap-solidity/blob/main/src/AcuityAccount.sol
undefined says Sorry - my bad. My app was sending the tx to the wrong contract address.
undefined says is there any tutorial how to extract this in docker properly?
undefined says Does bridging works the same in Arbi as in Polygon?
undefined says extract to the local directory you made, example: `/some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet` you would extract inside the `arbitrum-mainnet` folder
undefined says hm... ,"MountPoints":{"/home/crypto/.arbitrum/mainnet":{"Source":"/home/crypto/arbitrum-mainnet","Destination":"/home/crypto/.arbitrum/mainnet" ... "WorkingDir":"/home/user".... this is my config for this arbitrum container.. but the content of "db" is in /home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet/db... i see that with command "docker container exec -it da929c7ec75a bash -c "ls /home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet"". Is this from /home/user/.arbitrum mapped somewehre?
undefined says `/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet` stays the same, it's the dir in the container
undefined says yes... how can i extract db.tar in /home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet?
undefined says you dont
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/docs/running_node
undefined says Where to send screen shot
undefined says if i understand correctly.. if i extract in /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet/.. which is in my case /home/crypto/arbitrum-mainnet.. and restart container, that should be it?
undefined says yes ser, as long as your policies are correct. Requires a relog.
undefined says https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
and 
`chmod -fR 777 /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet`
undefined says I'm running an arbitrum subgraph but want to run a node along side it as well to improve the speed for indexing
undefined says Is the regular Arbitrum node by default an archive node too?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/docs/running_node
> If archive support is desired, recommend using --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000
undefined says wicked thank you, and I read something about a 2TV should suffice to run that on as well?
undefined says if you are also running off of a local ETH node yes NVMe with high IOPs
undefined says will take awhile to sync
undefined says I'm running an Arbitrum Graph node and want the Arbitrum endpoint to be on the same box so that new subgraphs sync ultra fast
undefined says What is the initial sync time? Similar to Geth mainnet or more like Erigon?
undefined says it takes days from the snapshot taken back in March. Mainnet: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says Hey guys, I got a question about rollups. Is it a active thing one can do and what is the difference to bridging?
undefined says what do you mean? https://developer.arbitrum.io/docs/inside_arbitrum
undefined says Thanks, now I understand 😄
undefined says thank you, i will try
undefined says I see. Could you point me to the place at which non-sequencers execute transactions? As I understand, you use `core.ApplyTransaction` from go-ethereum as entry point, but this is only called from `ProduceBlockAdvanced` which as you say is only run by the sequencer.

For context, I'm trying to modify the block processing logic and am looking for the places I have to touch. one is of course `core.ApplyTransaction`, but all block level stuff must be done somewhere else I don't seem to be able to find
undefined says do you mean eth_call (non-mutating)
undefined says no, I thought everyone could sync the chain from the data that's posted on L1, not only the sequencer
undefined says possible to update it to something more recent?
undefined says Not my call fren. Better than starting from scratch.
undefined says gotcha
non-sequencer node call `ProduceBlock` and within `ProduceBlock` will call `ProduceBlockAdvanced` which eventually hit `core.ApplyTransaction`
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/338121056128763e31b910ff1209cb47e407c8d4/arbnode/transaction_streamer.go#L723-L730
undefined says Hey everyone! 
Do you know if there's a way to get the first/last bock number of a given day?
undefined says you can use subgraph e.g. https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/sushiswap/arbitrum-blocks
undefined says Great! Thank you. Do you know if there's anything similar for arbi rinkeby?
undefined says you can try to search at the bottom of this page https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/
undefined says Does the gas mechanism work the same on arbitrum as mainnet?  With `max_gwei_per_gas` and `max_priority_fee_per_gas`?  Is there some dev documentation for how I should be setting the gas values?
undefined says we doesn't support type 2 tx format (e.g. tx with maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas)
undefined says `gasPrice` only
undefined says With approx what gas fee should I calculate for deposits (L1->L2) and withdrawal (L2->L1)?
undefined says Ok, is there a recommended gas API for arbitrum?
undefined says you can use eth_estimateGas from rpc
undefined says and while we don't have 1559 field, we charge gas like 1559; so the `gasPrice` is actually a `gasPriceBid` and you will be refunded the extra
undefined says Ok, so if I have a transaction I really want included quickly, the best way to do that is setting a high `gasPrice` ?
undefined says It won't be any quicker as long as your gasPrice is >= currentGasPrice since our sequencer operation in FIFO manner
undefined says Ok, thank you!
undefined says For this change https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/838ba2193e84f54df316a5ea6b0bd3ed4d0fdb37/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#breaking-changes,

`Ethereum L1 Gas Compatibility partying_face: gas pricing and accounting for EVM operations is be perfectly in line with L1; no more ArbGas.`

If I understand correctly, currently ArbGas is an estimation of L1 gas fee. With Nitro, it will no longer be an estimation and be 1:1. Thus ArbGas is no longer needed?
undefined says And the reason why Nitro makes gas accounting 1:1 is because AVM opcodes are 1:1 with L1 EVM now?

`No more storage gas: there is no more concept of a separate pool of storage gas, and opcodes are priced identically to the L1 EVM.`
undefined says and then finally I see that no ArbGas eliminates need for storage gas pool...but why is that the case?
undefined says Is the AVM no longer needed as well because you are using Geth core directly?
undefined says yes
undefined says is there any way to get an advantage in getting your tx submitted faster? Or is it not possible due to FIFO that the sequencer uses
undefined says the faster you submit the more likely you are the first
undefined says Are there any factors that impact the "the faster you submit" part?
undefined says computation, network, etc.
undefined says so if two transactions are submitted from equal geographic locations but  tx 1 is like 100bytes and  tx 2 is like 1000 bytes, then tx1 will arrive at the sequencer first?
undefined says there are a lot of other factors, but whichever reach our sequencer first with get included first
undefined says makes sense thanks
undefined says btw @gzeon | Offchain Labs it looks like offchain labs will need new documentation for all the arbitrum nitro changes.

I would be happy to help (if that is something I can help with)
undefined says we are working on it, here are some nitro docs https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/master/docs
undefined says Is there a  reason the arbitrum node doesn't return a baseFeePerGas the way that ethereum mainnet returns one? does arbitrum implement EIP-1559 or is it specified another way?
undefined says in the doc, the parameter of `depositEth` function is `destAddr`, but on the smart contract, it's `maxSubmissionCost`(uint256)
undefined says 
undefined says As I understand, aggregators send transactions received from clients to the delayed inbox. If so, when do aggregators execute transactions and update their local state?
undefined says I think it's the validators that executes the calldata from the inbox and update their local state data.
undefined says Is there a good step by step tutorial on setting this up? If not I'll contribute one if I can get some pointers.
undefined says Sorry, new here so wasn't sure which channel to post this in, but I had a Q about checking syncing status I posted in support : https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/989569232272502904

undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs @Brady | Offchain Labs  @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs  Can you help me with this? Thanks!
undefined says Basically, I am trying to calculate the the gasPrice and I need `block.BaseFee()`. Moreover, when I retrieve arbitrum txs, `tx.type()` is `1`, which denotes `LegacyTx` . Shouldn't be it `100+`
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/de56ab0252f8164b6c0693e163e38060ca23f5ff/core/types/transaction.go#L54
undefined says Can you help me understand this statement from the docs? "Arbitrum blockhash is a value deterministically generated from the L1 block number and state of the inbox."
undefined says Which network are you on? The geth fork is for Arbitrum Nitro which is only deployed to devnet (NOT mainnet/rinkeby)
undefined says the `blockhash(x)` op code in Arbitrum generate a hash from (x, inboxState) where x is a L1 block number
it is a different hash from L1 block.hash or L2 block.hash you can find on e.g. Etherscan/Arbiscan
undefined says Kinda a newbie question but are assets on arbitrum bridged in the traditional sense where an asset is locked on the ETH side and then minted on the other (eg ETH -> Sol/Polygon)?

Basically I’m trying to figure out whether the bridge mechanic has any difference security wise compared to a bridge to a sidechain.
undefined says Understood! While fetching blocks, I don't see any BaseFee(), which is required to calculate gasprice! I am on mainnet only!
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_basics
undefined says Read the overall documentation, maybe you'll get something out of it.
undefined says I followed the steps to get docker up and running and have noticed that it's going through the indexing now with everything happening in the `db` folder.

I'm guessing the approach for a faster archive node is to download the db snapshot link above and then run docker from that point?
undefined says Yup. It will still take some time with the snapshot. Better than starting from a fresh sync though.
undefined says 
undefined says Managed to find some docs related to withdrawals, I think I have a better understanding now, thank you :)

undefined says how I can check my Arrbitrum Node which I have run?
undefined says how to run node arbitrum ?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/docs/running_node
undefined says You can check your node’s log or you ca send rpc request to your node.
undefined says Could someone explain how this exploit could work? I'm not exactly seeing why it prevents an attacks. 
"The Arbitrum protocol's usage of L2 Aliases for L1-to-L2 messages prevents cross-chain exploits that would otherwise be possible if we simply reused L1 contact addresses."

from https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#address-aliasing
undefined says Hi, this is because there might be 2 contract with the same address on arbitrum and ethereum, and the contract(A) on arbitrum might have some funds which only it can control. But if we do not alias the address, then if the contract on ethereum send a cross-rollups message to arbitrum, then this txn’s `from` will be same to contract A, so it can control the funds on A.
undefined says I don't know command to check my node's log. Can you help me?
undefined says Just use docker way to read the log. Or you can see the daemon in docker ps.

undefined says ty dude
undefined says I am specially interested in this functionality described in your docs:
> If your custom token has the ability to increase its supply (i.e, mint) directly on the L2, and you want the L2-minted tokens be withdrawable back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract, it will probably require its own special gateway. 

Would I need to create my gateway?

If I understand correctly the Router is forever fixed and immutable, while as many gateways as we wish can be created to bridge our assets with different logic.
undefined says Is that correct?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs did you eventually come up with some solution?
undefined says I see the router and gateways are upgradeable. It seems then that there is no trustless bridging between L2 <-> L1 because the contracts can be changed by Arbitrum.
undefined says Are ETH on Arbi real ETH or ETH like backed by real eth on L1 ?
undefined says Backed by L1 ETH
undefined says ETH only "exists" on L1
undefined says @Xatarrer  where/who holds these L1 backed eths then ? Bridges/Protocols from where we transfer eth L1 to L2 right ?
undefined says like celer...
undefined says It depends on which bridge you use. If your use the canonical bridge, it is Arbitrum's gateway.
undefined says the reset are held by dApps then ?
undefined says like if one bridge/dApp got hacked backed eth could be lost forever ?
undefined says Im not keen on the details but I think for any generic bridge, once you bridge you are safe. It is in the process that your funds are at risk. Any AETH is backed by ETH on L1 which is held by the Arbitrum gateway, even the AETH you get from other bridges. On the question about if the canonical bridge can be hacked, I wonder the same. I assume it is quite trustless, but I notice it is an upgradeable contract, so I am not sure what are the trust guarantees. But if it was hacked, it would be the demise of Arbitrum imo.
undefined says nothing is more secure than L1 anyway... by definition

undefined says This @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says and this
undefined says Yes you can have custom gateway for your token, it would be the best if you can implement the register function in your token so you can register your gateway to the router trustlessly
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/c008c8dfcfe4e900af20be9697d6c6686eebf345/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L172

If you want to mint in L2 and bridge back to L1, you can take a look at this PR (not deployed) https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/pull/1713 which basically mean your token will implement a `bridgeMint` function that the bridge/gateway can call to mint extra supply on L1
undefined says The remaining question is how trustless is the gateway and router if they are upgradeable contracts.

undefined says Hey, guys! We are buidling cross-chain protocol for Arbitrum. How can we apply for Arbitrum grants program?
undefined says I have a question about the ArbAddressTable. My understanding is that the purpose of it is so that we can save gas on mainnet by submitting an index (number) instead of the address when submitting the calldata on the L1 inbox. My question is could this idea be extended to other data structures other than addresses? For example, could you create a MyArbArrayTable, which maps indexes to uint arrays, saving L1 gas by submitting an index instead of an array in the calldata? Or is my understanding wrong?
Thanks!
undefined says Hi, what array you want to map? Basically, if a data which will be used for many times then we can create a map so it will save the gas in the future use, but if data only used for one time, it is not useful to map it, because we also need register it and record it, so address is a good thing to create the map. For others data, we use compaction algorithm to save the gas costed on l1.

undefined says Due to the censorship resistant design it is possible to include any tx to a block, including those with duplicated hash. This is useful when one try to force include a tx from L1 inbox. Arb-os will discards the repeated tx as invalid when it shows up again without mutating the states and the rpc interface returns the first one.

undefined says > After adding the new gas to the pool, if the new gas pool size is G, the current ArbGas price is multiplied by (16200S - G) / (14400S) where S is the ArbGas speed limit of the chain. This quantity will be 7/8 when G = 720S (the maximum gas pool size) and it will be 9/8 when G = 0
undefined says That looks wrong?
undefined says 16200 - 720 = 15,480
undefined says 15480 / 14400 = 1.075
undefined says Where am I going wrong?
undefined says My maths says G needs to be 3600S?

undefined says Is it possible to setup a local full node of Arbitrum on my laptop and communicate with that from JavaScript instead of using a remote RPC node? And if so, is there a guide on how to setup a local full node?
undefined says which arb-node version are you on

undefined says docker image
undefined says make sense, already let our team know.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says question, why arbitrum has lower gas used?
undefined says i see that in each tx, it only cost several thousand unit of gas
undefined says while in Ethereum, a tx cost at least 21000 unit of gas
undefined says I am about to write a post regarding this
quick answer is that there are 2 component of L2 gas (L1 and L2)
the L1 component is priced in eth, for example if the cost to post on L1 is 0.001 eth and the L2 gas price is 1 gwei, we calculate the L1 component to be (0.001/1gwei) = 100k gas
undefined says but when the L2 gas is like 100 gwei, the L1 component is (0.001/100gwei) = 1k gas
undefined says and in arb1 (before nitro), we charge arbGas instead of EVM gas, so a transaction and cost less than 21k L2 computation gas
undefined says what's the base stake amount set to? is there an actual number i can reference to? couldn't find it on doc
undefined says you can read the value here
https://etherscan.io/address/0xc12ba48c781f6e392b49db2e25cd0c28cd77531a/advanced#readProxyContract
undefined says but it will change when we introduce more validator
undefined says qq, wasn't Arbitrum supposed to get cheaper the more users it get? rn the gas is 3 times higher than mainnet, what am I missing?
undefined says it's not more expensive, the actual fee is still lower in comparable use case
undefined says the gas price is higher, but the gas used can be lower
undefined says so gas prices are not comparable 1:1 then
undefined says is there any formula or anything to be able to draw a comparison?
undefined says for example a simple transfer just a minute ago cost $0.25 at 143 L2 gwei
undefined says correct
undefined says L2 gas price only applies to the L2 components
undefined says L1 component is not affected by L2 gas price
undefined says why don`t arbitrum ease the controls a little to reduce the gas
undefined says so as a dev, when I write a line of code I can see how much gas that'll consume and hence an ETH/USD value depending on the current gas price
undefined says how can I do the same (or similar) for Arbitrum?
undefined says I'm writing a protocol that's going to both L1 & L2 and now I'm super confused on how to measure costs on Arbitrum
undefined says also as a side note, get in touch with the zapper guys, they also treble the USD cost in their gas estimate, so it really looks that Arbitrum is 3x expensive than L1 rn
undefined says yes I understand, working on it
undefined says I prepared a swap on Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum earlier today, and the tsx cost reported by Metamask was like 3 USD. I then prepared the equivalent swap on Ethereum mainnet and the swap cost was around 4 USD. I was shocked by how little difference there was.
undefined says maybe MM has the same issue as Zapper?
undefined says they're assuming gas prices 1:1 so the USD estimate is completely off
undefined says from what i understand L2 gwei is cheaper but L2 gasUsed is more expensive which they are trying to solve with nitro
undefined says A gwei is just a fraction of an ETH, which should have the same value on arbitrum as on eth mainet right? So how can L2 gwei be cheaper?
undefined says sorry i mean gas price

undefined says from the tx lifecycle doc: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/tx_lifecycle
> The sequencer has ordered and confirmed the transaction but has not yet posted it to the L1 chain in a batch. At this stage,the transaction can be considered final if the user is willing to trust the sequencer, but a malicious sequencer could violate this finality.

considering l2 blocks are all single transactions, and the above claims finality of a tx once accepted by the sequencer, does this mean re-orgs aren't possible with an honest sequencer? will this finality assumption hold as the sequencer becomes more decentralized?
undefined says looks to be working if anyone finds this in the future
undefined says Guys, fees decrease with increased rollup usage, right?
undefined says I saw charts going around which show mainnet being cheaper at times
undefined says how can this be? What am I missing?
undefined says Looking forward to the post my friend. Plz @ me then, thanks!
undefined says Hi, l2 blocks can also have 2 or more tx, it depends on the network congestion. And if you trust the sequencer, then you can directly regard the results it send back to you. For reorg, once the sequencer push your tx to l1, it won’t reorg anymore(unless l1 reorg), because your tx order is fixed when your tx fixed on l1, so your state will also be fixed.
undefined says They said this is because more tx can share the fee which push their tx on l1. But l2 also has congestion fee, so it hard to say it will be cheaper when l2’s tx became more.
undefined says ahh makes sense! i thought it was the case that all blocks were created instantly  w/ single transactions, but i suppose with enough tx it makes sense to bundle at the same time
undefined says so its still possible for a tx/block to get reorg'ed  before rolling up to L1? just trying to clarify my understanding of the finality assumptions when indexing the chain
undefined says I’m trying to run an Arbitrum node locally using this guide https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node. I have a synced Geth Ethereum mainnet node running configured with flag “--port 30302”. When I try to start the docker image to run the Arbitrum node it seems that it cannot find my Geth node. This is the error I am getting:
`{"level":"warn","component":"configuration","error":"Post \"https://l1-node:30302\": dial tcp: lookup l1-node on 172.17.64.1:53: no such host","time":"2022-06-29T14:45:13Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-util/configuration/configuration.go:649","message":"Error getting chain ID"}`
What do I have to change? This is how I attempt to run the Arbitrum docker image:
`docker run --rm -it  -v /mnt/e/arbitrum-mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.0-f4bbe91 --l1.url https://l1-node:30302`
undefined says Yup, it still has some possibilities, but it's very unlikely.
undefined says right on, appreciate your help!
undefined says Np
undefined says Is your l1 node is on 172.17.64.1:53?
undefined says I’m not sure, I have never connected to my Geth node using an ip-address before. I normally only use the node with ethers.js where I connect using the url .\\pipe\\geth.ipc. Do you know how I can verify the ip-address of the node?
undefined says stupid question but will bootup it be faster after pruning?
undefined says try `localhost:30302` or `127.0.0.1:30302`
undefined says I don’t think so
undefined says What scaling can we expect in terms of L2 fees? I mean if L2 fees surpass L1 fees and it's high L2 fees + partial L1 fees there wouldn't be much incentive of using it at all
undefined says Hey guys. Is there any website where I can take a look at gas prices and other historic data for Arbitrum? I know there are tx related stats on Arbitrum scan but it’s not enough
undefined says Newbe here!  Hope I can get some EDU.  I sold some ETH for (I thought) USDC.  On the CB wallet it lists the coin as "arbFiatToken" (FIAT).  Can someone explain what's happened?  Bottom line I am trying to move it to Ledger.. no ideas.
undefined says You figure this?
undefined says How about add --ipc=host?
undefined says First, we can compressed the data pushed to l1 more efficiently(we do this in nitro), second, the l1 will charge less for the calldata which also reduce the data pushing cost(eip4488), third, we can make our l2 computation more efficient, this is why we use wasm to compile evm in nitro.
undefined says You mean how to use dex?
undefined says Hey can someone explain why the gas used by the same transaction has gone 100x in the past 12 hours or so?
undefined says If this is trying to limit network congestion i would have assumed you'd do that through the gas price and not by adjusting the gas used
undefined says Hi, this is because we have the gas price adjust mechanism like eip1559, when network’s usage up, the fee will also increase, which caused the price is keeping increase. Also, we have four gas part: l1 calldata, l1 fixed fee, l2 computational, l2 storage cost. And the arbgas price you see is for computational. So when arbgas price comes up, if we don’t adjust the gas usage in total, which will cause the others part’s cost will be higher, but actually especially for l1 part, it doesn’t change, we we can only adjust the gas usage. If you want to calculate the gas by those 4 part, you can see advanced txInfo in arbiscan, there you will see the gas usage for each single part doesn’t change.
undefined says Ahhh okay that makes sense, thanks.
undefined says I have tried three ways of starting the docker image now: 1) with `--l1.url https://127.0.0.1:8545`, 2) with `--l1.url http://localhost:8545`, 3) with `--ipc=host --l1.url https://127.0.0.1:8545`.
Method 1 and 2 produces connection refused errors:
`{"level":"warn","component":"configuration","error":"Post \"https://127.0.0.1:8545\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8545: connect: connection refused","time":"2022-06-30T06:39:13Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-util/configuration/configuration.go:649","message":"Error getting chain ID"}`

Method 3 gives error “unknown flag --ipc” Maybe I misunderstood what you meant with that flag?

From javascript I am able to connect to my l1 node like this: `ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("http://localhost:8545")`
undefined says Oh, if you use IP address to connect, you need use your lan ip or 0.0.0.0 instead.
undefined says Do you mean like this? `--l1.url http://0.0.0.0`
undefined says And add your port
undefined says That also gave connection refused error `--l1.url http://0.0.0.0:8545`
`{"level":"warn","component":"configuration","error":"Post \"http://0.0.0.0:8545\": dial tcp 0.0.0.0:8545: connect: connection refused","time":"2022-06-30T07:22:58Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-util/configuration/configuration.go:649","message":"Error getting chain ID"}`

I also tried using my computers local IP like this: `--l1.url http://192.168.31.61:8545`, which gave a different error. It took about 30 seconds for the error to appear, but then I got a timeout error:
`{"level":"warn","component":"configuration","error":"Post \"http://192.168.31.61:8545\": dial tcp 192.168.31.61:8545: i/o timeout","time":"2022-06-30T07:17:42Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-util/configuration/configuration.go:649","message":"Error getting chain ID"}`
undefined says Can you connect to 192.168.31.61:8545 on your local script?
undefined says No not from javascript/ethers. As far as I can tell I can only connect to http://localhost:8545

undefined says You need to set the correct from address
undefined says Emmmm, do you mean the parameters?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Yes, I passed
undefined says It’s the L2 alias of the gateway
undefined says Like this:

    maxSubmissionPrice,
    refundDestination,
    refundDestination,

    gasPriceBid,
    calldata,

```
undefined says And the address are:
```
const sender = '0x91169Dbb45e6804743F94609De50D511C437572E' // l1 gateway

I am able to launch the arb node fine, if I use my infura endpoint for the l1-node. However, the eth node I would like to use requires authorization to make RPC calls, such as :
`curl --user USERNAME:PASSWORD --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","id":1}' https://l1-node-with-auth`
Is there some flag I need to add to the docker command or some way to authorize in the arbitrum docker container? Thanks
undefined says you need to apply alias to it https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/321477440d0b9037568faa81fece30233d949e85/src/lib/dataEntities/address.ts#L23-L46
undefined says I don't think it is possible but you can setup a proxy that do the auth I suppose
undefined says noob question: If I call `sendTxToL2`, and then immediately send another transaction that calls `sendTxToL2`, can the sequencer reverse the order of these transactions in the inbox so they get executed out of order on the L2 side?
undefined says hey guys, gigabrains from the team released this cool article about 2-dimensional fees!!!!

https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says Thanks, turns out I can just use `https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@l1-node-url` as the l1 node instead.
undefined says When running a node with docker image, it wants to start to resync every time.  Not cool.  So I followed instructions to install local version, which I would prefer anyway, and can't find any executables to run and the help section on chain management or whatever is down for service.  Th example command for starting a validator doesn't work either, i assume because arb-node or whatever, wherever it is, wasn't copied to usr/local/bin.  Could I get some help/guidance please?  This seemed the more appropriate channel than the support channel with talk of reward NFT's and such...thanks again!
undefined says Could I say that one batch transactions uploading to L1 equal to one rollup block ?
undefined says You can look at how `arbitrum/packages/arb-node.Dockerfile` is done. Also, we don’t support run a validators for personal.
undefined says In order to prevent the node from syncing each time on startup in docker you need to mount a volume at `~/.arbitrum/.mainnet`
undefined says Nope, it’s not equal, rollups block is proposed by validator, while tx batch is pushed by sequencer.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs , it is for livepeer orchestrators. Though I don’t understand why someone couldn’t run their own rpc endpoint for personal development/project use. But that isn’t my fight to fight. Lol.  Thank you @ImagineBeingAtComputers !
undefined says so sequencer will like pick several blocks of transactions to publish a tx batch ?
undefined says We have 2 block type on arbitrum, one is sequencer block(this is what you see on arbiscan), another is rollups block. Sequencer will pick several sequencer block and batch those tx to l1. And validators will listen on this, and then propose rollup block once in a while. The rollups block is used to stake on the state of l2 and let the l2->l1 tx legally.
undefined says You can run normal fullnode to provide rpc service , but validator we haven’t opened registration yet.
undefined says Ohhh, got it, thanks a lot!
undefined says and sequencer block is made of transactions in inbox contract ? Thanks for replying my questions!
undefined says Gotcha, thank you!
undefined says Sequencer block is made by the network’s tx and then sequencer will send those tx it got from users to the sequencer inbox on l1.
undefined says So, I was on mobile when I responded, and have come back and been playing with my docker syntax.  I thought I was doing that to begin with and have played with it a ton of ways, and can't seem to get it to persist correctly.  Basing it off this: -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet  But not sure what else to do, as I have created the dir, made sure permissions correct.  Completely puzzled.  Not a docker whiz, I admit, but any clues appreciated!
undefined says tried it with .mainnet and mainnet as docs say
undefined says is the lowest gas price set to 0.398630067 Gwei? since the MAINNET gas price is dropping to 10Gwei, can we see 0.1 Gwei gas price on ARB? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says 0.1gwei will be possible if ethereum network’s average gas price come to 10 Gwei. You can check the gas price information arbgas calculate here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L13 with address table https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Why I was not allowed to brand the nft. I did a swap in the first week on Hop Polygon Bridge, everything went fine and I was shown that I had done everything, there was a tick, and now it's not there.....why?
undefined says Did you use non-eth token to bridge?
undefined says 
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/block/0xa94af7cfbf72b9a9566c8505e9cd2ad9ead87630e4ec83e20cd807806617bbfc
undefined says Why can't I check this block in the block browser, my node is currently about 50w blocks behind the main network
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  Do you know why this is?
undefined says Block hashes are verified against sequencer, node will quit if block has is incorrect.  You need to use rpc call to check block hashes, not log files
undefined says So blocks in the log may be filtered out
undefined says Yes, use rpc way for better.
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says Hey quick Q regarding bridge -  From my understanding If a L1 -> L2 ticket expires, call value is refunded to the creditBackAddress, what if this ticket is from a ERC20 token bridge? How are the un-minted L2 tokens handled?
undefined says What exact issue are you running into?
undefined says Just wanted to check in on expected timings for the sync.

I've been running from the db download (so March?) since 25th, so about 6 days now.

I'm up to 22nd March from what I can tell (see image)  and at the same time yesterday I was at athe 3rd March.  Does 19 days sync in 24 hours sound about right?
undefined says I don't know time-frame specifics like that. I spun up another node a few weeks ago from the db and it took about 4 days to fully sync.
undefined says Did you run `chmod -fR 777 /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet` for the directory you made? There's also these linux post-install steps for docker to double check:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/
undefined says In my experience it wouldn't even start without the correct policies but worth to check
undefined says It starts to resync the DB on every start-up.  The chain data isn't persisting.
undefined says Hmmm, taking way longer than that on the recommend hardware as well.
undefined says Yes
undefined says I'm reluctant to restart my server but interested to see if the same thing happens.
undefined says I followed the same steps
undefined says i got about 5 days and 4.5 milion blocks in and did....lol.  But wanted to changed l1 endpoints as that seemed insanely long
undefined says And now I want it fixed before I start again
undefined says ```
sudo docker run --rm -it  -v /var/arbitrum/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.0-f4bbe91 --l1.url http://mynodeendpoint:8545 --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000
```
undefined says ^ that is what I'm using
undefined says maybe 3days....i don't know.  It was too long for that many blocks
undefined says I just realised that my endpoint was the erigon endpoint which is throwing errors which might contribute to the lack of speed on my update
undefined says rebooting now to confirm if the separate mounted volume persists
undefined says Good luck!
undefined says Strange. I would try those post install steps, run the `chmod` again for the directory you made, log out and back in, and then try it.
undefined says just ran chmod again and will reboot
undefined says Using javery's example, `/var/arbitrum/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet` 
`/var/arbitrum/` would be the local directory.  `/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet` is inside the docker image, that doesnt change.
undefined says I've seen this confuse some.
undefined says exactly how I thought, but I even made them both out of an abundance of caution and more frustration.  lol
undefined says How can I run this outside docker?  I couldn't find the executables after compile.
undefined says This is just silly
undefined says guess i can go look at docker compose file...lol
undefined says Hmmm, doesn't look good. After rebooting and rerunning I'm here

undefined says yes, if it would persist....
undefined says That's how the node usually starts up. Takes about 30 min to get going.
undefined says True lol I ran into that issue before but using the steps I suggested fixed it. I'm sure you'll figure it 👍
undefined says I appreciate the confidence.  lol
undefined says Trial and error fren. There's a lot of good info in this discord and if you ask questions the team and community are very helpful 🙂
undefined says ^ this 100%.  

Thanks for the tip on waiting 30 minutes.... I guess I'm being impatient.  Fingers crossed it kicks off where I left it but I'll report back either way.
undefined says Looks like it did. `timestamp: Wed Mar 23 14:05:21 2022`
undefined says pretty sure the db snapshot is from March 10th
undefined says It may take longer depending on your hardware as well. Patience is def key. This will all improve soon with the nitro release. Very excited to see the improvements.
undefined says Thanks for the link to the additional compile steps.  Had done most following the docs.  They just left it short....  Downloading snapshot now, but running local, data persists....as one would imagine
undefined says @javery , friend with more experience said these nodes take forever to do things.  I don't have patience either.
undefined says GETH took a long time too which is the main reason I switched over to Erigon for mainnet.  I don't mind waiting as long as I'm sure it's going in the right direction.
undefined says You'll prob need this too depending on your distro https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8945/how-can-i-increase-open-files-limit-for-all-processes
undefined says thx.  don't remember why, but ive had to do that...i think running venus-filecoin maybe
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says Is this snapshot data from arbitrum?
undefined says Is there a tutorial on how to use snapshot data?
undefined says I'm looking to run my own arbitrum node and was wondering what the system requirements are besides a 1tb+ nvme ssd and a good internet connection
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/983796719743549450
undefined says I restart my node, and it was terminated at Loading chain data step without drop any error message. just terminated it. did it means my chain data was broken? or out of memory? I have 32G memory.
undefined says I'm running a couple nodes with 32gigs of memory and haven't had this issue
undefined says were you able to get it running again?
undefined says I am trying again. let’s wait for loading
undefined says it was terminated again without any error message. Any idea?
undefined says I've been running my own node for ~7 months now, but as of a few days ago it isn't really working. It got stuck reporting "sequencer feed signing address validated" but stopped advancing blocks. When I rebooted the node it got to a single "sync update" message and is now frozen. Was there some major update I missed that broke old node versions?
undefined says Update on my issue: my L1 node was actually the issue, my geth node is frozen for some reason, so not an Arbitrum node issue
undefined says Just a scam.
undefined says Did you cleanly shut down the node before restart? If the db has been corrupted you may have to re-sync fren.
undefined says looks like out-of-memory to me
you would need swap space if you are running with 32gb memory
undefined says I do have swap on mine. Good to know 👍
undefined says Ok I will try to add swap space
undefined says You change rpc?
undefined says Hello! I am trying to understand if there is a log or message emitted by the sequencer when it receives the transaction and ordering is decided. There is TransactionReceipt which according to the docs is "ArbOS emits one log item for each transaction request it receives.", does this mean its emitted by the sequencer after the transaction has been executed? Is there anything else that can be used to confirm that the sequencer has received the transaction sooner even if it has not been executed?
undefined says You can call to https://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed to see those information sent by sequencer.
undefined says Would sequencer upload transactions at a fixed time like every 10 min ?
undefined says .
undefined says i have few questions
how to setup local blockchain using arbitrum?
undefined says Nope, no fixed time: https://arbiscan.io/batches
undefined says We currently don’t support this tutorial.
undefined says Thanks Jason, is there any docs on this?
undefined says Perhaps currently no docs about this details, but this docs has some related information: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbos_formats
undefined says i want to debug arbitrum internal. 
how i can debug arbitrum internal?
undefined says What do you mean debug internal?
undefined says I've noticed that when sending a normal tx (value transfer), the gas used ranges from 3K to nearly 500K. What causes this difference? This is a value transfer from a normal account to a normal account, no smart contracts involved
undefined says i am white hacker
i want to find bug in arbitrum architecture and prove it.
so, i want to debug arbitrum internal process
undefined says https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs/status/1542585151858810880
undefined says also https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1542077617138200576
undefined says we don't have updated doc for running a local arbitrum classic (pre-nitro) rollup, but it is possible
outdated docs https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/5bd9a456a780582715a62affd887d35e2eb138b0/docs/Local_Blockchain.md
also some arb-os docs https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/tree/develop/doc
undefined says Thanks, I get it now
undefined says How do I know what to use as the gas limit when making a tx?
undefined says Also if you want to test nitro, here is the script to run it locally: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash
undefined says Just use rpc call: eth_estimateGas.
undefined says Cheers
undefined says When will arbitrum nitro be released?
undefined says Not yet announced. But will be very soon.
undefined says https://github.com/truffle-box/arbitrum-box/issues/12
undefined says i saw same error
undefined says how i solve this error?
undefined says Thank you for using your time
undefined says I'm trying to run a local network with a custom chain config. I added one to `go-ethereum/params/config_arbitrum.go` and updated the l2 chain id in `testnode-scripts/config.ts`. But my sequencer panics:
```
panic: Error starting protocol stack: expected L2 chain ID 452346 but read L2 chain ID 412346 from init message in L1 inbox
```
It seems whoever sends the init message isn't aware of my shiny new chain config. Any pointers who/where the init message is sent?

Also, I've never heard about init messages before. Is there any documentation what they do?
undefined says How Sequencer decide how many txs should be included in a sequencer block ?
undefined says how did you run local arbitrum network?
undefined says using the testnode script in the nitro repo: `./test-node.bash --no-blockscout --init --detach`
undefined says test-node.bash is not exist in official github repository
(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum)
undefined says oh... nitro
undefined says sorry
undefined says anyone knows how to create arbitrum local network? (not nitro)
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/993435288598745130
undefined says Sequencer will produce sequencer block once the tx come, but if the network is busy and more than one tx come in the same time, sequencer may produce a block with more than one tx.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Jason i have one question
undefined says i try to setup local arbitrum chain according to your giving link (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/5bd9a456a780582715a62affd887d35e2eb138b0/docs/Local_Blockchain.md).

undefined says Aha, Thank a lot. Also find those in the arbitrum-sdk repo, generated as  .ts files
undefined says hey guys! i'm currently building a gas fee tracker, where I want to include the Arbitrum chain and i've saw a 1000 gwei tx: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xba259905e41672829521d0e4f5bfc94e22d4b182190e541399228007f1339290. Can anyone explain what's this about? cuz all the others are like ~ 0.30 gwei and this one spoil the hole gas fee tracker. Shoul I just ignore this type of txs? Thanks!
undefined says This is just a price bid, actually it only cost 0.24 gwei as you can see in Gas Price Paid
undefined says Thanks! I've noticed that... but the ethers getBlockWithTransactions() function returns the txs containing the gasPrice (the bid price) so I'm thinking what could be the best approach to get the actual gas price paid for Arbitrum?
undefined says You can call eth_getTransactionReceipt for a single tx.
undefined says Also, you can call this https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol#L13, here is the address table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/useful_addresses
undefined says Thanks, but I'm using ethers js
undefined says So I should use the ArbGasInfo contract(0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006C) and call the getPricesInWeiWithAggregator() function, right?
undefined says yes, and the gas price is base + congestion.
undefined says Thanks! I will test it 🙂
undefined says Are there any sort of figures available for anytrust chains yet? Specifically, how heavy will validators be? What kind of tx cost etc.
undefined says arb_deploy.py is the old file (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/scripts/arb_deploy.py)

undefined says I want to try finding bug in ArbOS
If i use hardhat or tenderly, i think i can not check ArbOS code in runtime
undefined says What do you mean for local arbitrum?
undefined says local arbitrum = custom geth(L1) and arb-node (one sequencer + one aggregator)
undefined says If you are in sequencer mode, there won’t be aggregator in your network, so I think if you follow that guide and successfully build it, you are now running the arbitrum local network.
undefined says thank you for your answer!
undefined says Hello! one more question: I've mananged to take the gas price, but: could be a good approach to compute the avg gas price (base+congestion using your method), then slow one (avg-25%avg_gas_price) and the fast one(avg+25%/avg_gas_price) in order to have a accurate prediction? Thanks!
undefined says Arbitrum doesn’t have tx pool, and it includes tx by first come first service, so it is unnecessary to display fast or slow gas price like ethereum mainnet, jus display gas price paid is ok.
undefined says Ah, I got it! But what will happen if someone sends a tx with a 25% lower gas price than the avg (base+congestion)?
undefined says Sequencer will reject this tx.
undefined says I understand now! Thank you for your time!
undefined says Np
undefined says Hi! I'm wondering - if I have a tx that would exhaust the gas on L1 - can I submit it to arbitrum, or is the sequencer also going to reject it?
undefined says The reason I wonder is - I have a loop over some structs and I compute user balances. So I in theory could go over 10000 items and end up with 100 new balances. Sending the new state to L1 wouldn't exhaust the gas limit, but if the transaction was executed on L1 - there is no chance that it could run
undefined says Arbitrum also has a arbgas limit for tx, which is now 2.4m(noted arbgas is different from ethereum gas, arbgas is used for coomputation, and gas on arbitrum has 4 part: l1 calldata fee, l1 fixed fee, l2 computational fee and l2 storage fee).
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs so how do I calculate how much arbgas a tx will use?
undefined says You can also use eth_estimateGas to get the whole gas needed and to see if it will revert, or you can try send a tx on testnet and then call eth_getTransactionReceipt, you will see computational usage on feeStats.
undefined says another way is to use `estimateRetryableTicket`
undefined says Does a dex pool on sushiswap arbitrum have to be created on ethereum main net first?
undefined says If everything is validated on Eth main net I assume all tokens must be first created on main net, is that correct?
undefined says No need, arbitrum and ethereum are actually 2 different network, it doesn’t share one same state.
undefined says For example tracer has a 3X BTC Short token, If I swap it on Arbitrum how is it validated on Eth if the token only exists on Arbitrum?
undefined says I'm just trying to grasp how it works
undefined says The tokens bridged to arbitrum are locked on l1’s bridge contract, so it will release on l2.
undefined says Hey guys I have a question regarding bridges to Layer 2s such as arbitrum. What happens if i.e. all other bridges get drained? There should always be enough ETH (or other assets) to bridge back no (in=out)? Unless ofc there is a minting bug that lets you mint. Is it a correct statement to say that 3rd party bridges inherently give a systemic risk factor to the Layer 2?
and is the native arbi bridge by definition the most safe? or is i.e. a nomad (optimistic bridge with fraud proofs) safer?
are there bridges that let you personnaly give you a right to always bridge back? as in you are the only address that can bridge back with the same bridge you used, and that ETH is reserved for you on L1?
undefined says We got `ProviderError: execution ran out of gas` errors when deploy contract but we don't understand why @@
undefined says Is there anyone could help?
undefined says Arbibitrum bridge will lock your ETH on l1’s contract. And every eth goes to arbitrum also through this way. The 3rd part bridge is liquidity bridge, it doesn’t actually transfer the ethers but just change some liquidity. Those liquidity is added by the ethers(or other token) which come from our bridge. And our bridge is 1-to-1 mapping, so you don’t need to worry about that.
undefined says Did you use a fixed gas limit?
undefined says No
undefined says ```
arbitrum: {
      url: `https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${key}`,
      gasMultiplier: 1.2,
      accounts: [
        "..."
      ],
    },
```
This is my hardhat config file
undefined says So all 3rd party bridge-providers all route through the L1 arbi bridge contract? and are also limited to the assets the official arbi bridge holds?
undefined says Nope, those bridge are liquidity bridge, which needs others deposit token to provide liquidity, and those token(almost) are from our bridge.
undefined says "The ArbGas pool has a maximum capacity that is equal to 12 minutes of full-speed computation at the chain’s speed limit." from the docs.
What does "12 minutes of full-speed" mean? Why 12 minutes?
undefined says You can try to use another rpc.
undefined says Arbitrum’s gas speed limit. We limit the gas used limit per second.
undefined says Do you have a recommend one?
undefined says Just try our official rpc.
undefined says do these liquidity bridges typically Burn their ERC20 on L1 and Mint same ERC20 on L2? As with difference with ETH is that it is literally sent to the L2 instead of burn/mint?
undefined says Succeed @@ Thank you
undefined says No, liquidity bridge doesn’t burn and mint, they just have liquidity among chains, and user can bridge assets just use those liquidity (like dex).
undefined says If the transaction takes more than 12 minutes, does it fail?
undefined says We also have gas limit for each tx, if it exceeds that limit it will be reverted. This gas limit is for every tx, not the limit that users set.
undefined says last question promise: How does liquidity of other ERC20s initially get on the Layer 2 then? Is that all via the Arbi L1 contract?
undefined says Almost every token initially goes to arbitrum using our official bridge. But there are also some tokens use the bridge that token project team provide.
undefined says I see, Thank you very much Jason! Learned a lot from your answers. I wish you a very good day 🙂
undefined says Np. Wish you have a wonderful day too!
undefined says Has anyone tried to visualize data from arbiscan in PowerBI?
undefined says hey can anyone sggest me resources for optimistic rollups??
undefined says Is it possible to derive transactions that happened from the `Data` field in `InboxMessage` without the use of an AVM? Or does the field basically describe opcodes to be run to derive the current state? Referring to this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e4583390103b7151932b2352e8239338e9acc8f1/packages/arb-util/inbox/inboxMessage.go#L56-L63
undefined says Or - is there another struct somewhere that further breaks down that `Data` field? Trying to understand the relationship between the sequencer messages and the transactions that took place.
undefined says Arbitrum is bytelevel compatible to evm, so the data field in transaction is equal to evm.
undefined says Airdrop?
undefined says The Data field in the InboxMessage struct (from the sequencer feed) isn't the same as the data field in a transaction though no? Doing a bit of testing it seems that the InboxMessage Data field from the sequencer feed does not match raw transaction data if I make a simple transfer to myself
undefined says You mean the data you get from wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed? It should be this struct: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-util/broadcaster/types.go#L39
undefined says Yes, data from that feed. The specific piece I'm asking about is if you go by struct type BroadcastMessage -> BroadcastFeedMessage -> SequencerFeedItem -> inbox.SequencerBatchItem -> SequencerMessage (This line https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e4583390103b7151932b2352e8239338e9acc8f1/packages/arb-util/inbox/sequencerBatchItem.go#L33)

I believe the SequencerMessage bytes ends up being an encoded InboxMessage struct type found here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e4583390103b7151932b2352e8239338e9acc8f1/packages/arb-util/inbox/inboxMessage.go#L56-L63

This InboxMessage also has a data struct that is just bytes, which I believe is the "payload" from the sequencer feed containing actual transaction data (unless my understanding of how the sequencer feed works is wrong). 

I was wondering what this payload data actually represents as I cannot find a further struct that is packed into here, and can't seem to relate it to any transactions in the corresponding blocks.
undefined says the data is a rlp encoded `CompressedECDSATransaction`
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/f565e0571b6883bd7021f926ba823e9d0b609b5f/packages/arb-evm/message/l2Message.go#L427-L433
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/f565e0571b6883bd7021f926ba823e9d0b609b5f/packages/arb-evm/message/l2Message.go#L534
undefined says the sender of a `SequencerMessage` is the sequencer
while the data contain the actual transactions
there are a few possible types https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e67da09b916627a2774c44ea6b322b2a5545f090/packages/arb-evm/message/message.go#L34-L42
For a typical L2 tx it would be `L2Type inbox.Type = 3`
undefined says quick example:
```
"totalDelayedCount":690444,"sequencerMessage":"A6SxCsYeeeoeFQ33C43aUzkZKP0UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADmavwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYsfhNwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACI1Z7AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADawf/AoQcFqtagweTZpTCZlUe8GuXarxAP5mL064jmEA5N4cHkRrVoUcUAIaY/ZdiRhxrBCAH6ZojbVD2za9bZJjlaDLL37Rw3mZpYFjZgBY2o/bJDbdLVcjcYRAwcVmJo7iW4fpmsw2PLJ4A"
```
the first byte is A = 0x03 = L2Type
if you decode the sequencerMessage and extract the SequencerMessage.data, you will get
```
02 // nonce/SequenceNum
84 // 0x84 - 0x80 = 4 bytes
1c16ab5a // gasPrice
83 // 0x83 - 0x80 = 3 bytes
079366 // gas
94 // 0x94 - 0x80 = 20 bytes
c266551ef06b976abc403f998bd3ae2398403937 // to
87 // 0x87 - 0x80 = 7 bytes
07911ad5a14714 // value
00 // vByte
8698fd9762461c6b042007e99a236d50f6cdaf5b6498e56832cbdfb470de6669 // r 
6058d9801636a3f6c90db74b55c8dc611030715989a3b896e1fa66b30d8f2c9e // s
```
which is this tx
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x6a1d569ca0a8a64d868092ed42ad7d194293c3059cf9780991174f43dd8d3ba5
undefined says This is all incredibly helpful, exactly what I was looking for, thank you!
undefined says actually its not exactly rlp encoded
might need to look at this too https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/f565e0571b6883bd7021f926ba823e9d0b609b5f/packages/arb-evm/message/data.go#L204-L243
undefined says there are some extra compression with the to and value field
undefined says On `A = 0x03 = L2Type`, what type of encoding gets A equal to 3? I would expect to see  `A = 0x41` because as far as I can tell from `InboxMessage.ToBytes()` it just appends the uint8 value as the very first byte:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/e4583390103b7151932b2352e8239338e9acc8f1/packages/arb-util/inbox/inboxMessage.go#L273-L283
undefined says sorry I meant A6
it's base64 encoded

undefined says trying to setup a Arb node within a container, however after downloading and extracting the snapshot (in this location /user/.arbitrum/mainnet/), launching arbitrum container, Arb.go throws out the error -

undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says hey folk i'm looking for course to build layer 2 chain, anysuggestion or any idea how can we build a layer 2 chain?
undefined says Build l2 chain means deploy contracts on l2? You can start here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart
undefined says What's the hardware requirements of VPS to run the full node?
undefined says AWS z1d 2xlarge or other equally hardware.
undefined says How about CPU, RAM and Storage?
undefined says 
undefined says what amount should the maxSubmissionCost be set in Inbox.depositETH?
undefined says 
undefined says what is **base submission fee**?
undefined says If you just deposit eth, you can just use 0.

undefined says hey all! quick question:
what does a full node (offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.0-f4bbe91) actually do?
undefined says https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413938850075-What-s-the-hardware-requirements-to-run-the-full-node-
undefined says how long does it take to sync a full node? does it have snap sync like geth?
undefined says Currently it may take up to 2-3 weeks to sync a node, but with Nitro that should be drastically decreased
undefined says is there any documentation on how developers could begin using anytrust? i'm a bit confused on what the process is for creating committees and getting started with that
undefined says or is that information not out yet or only available to people who apply atm
undefined says if you mean deploying then yes you have to apply
undefined says https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScuVz5UNpmonn8j2tam9py0PItrXEZKE85iHNE0KHgbxZbeKg/viewform
undefined says You can start building on the chain by requesting access. In terms of the committee we’ve been assembling the first DAC and will be sharing more details about the members soon.
undefined says are there any estimates on how much the tx's actually cost with the committee functioning properly?
undefined says even just something like a percentage compared to the standard arbitrum rollup would be nice, because obviously it varies depending on tx gas but say a simple eth transfer for example
undefined says Is there any way to speed this up? Through snapshots for example?

undefined says I'm downloading transaction data to do on-chain data analysis for Arbitrum's projects but one field I find missing from the data is the smart contract's function name. For example I can see the function name in the log field here: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x7f4f042b4cbce6dfe7ddbd05485381d853885e85af6c744ade0ad6d3429c471d#eventlog but I can't find that from the data I downloaded from the RPC for both eth_getTransactionByHash and eth_getTransactionReceipt. Do you know where can I find the smart contract's function info for each transaction similar to the one display on Arbiscan? Thanks.
undefined says The url you post is events’ name, however, this data doesn’t store the event’s name on blockchain, but is its hash. If you call eth_getTransactionReceipt, you will see logs field, inside it you will see topics, the topcis[0] is what the hash is. You can seee more details here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72161117/how-to-read-events-log-from-transaction-receipt-with-web3-js
undefined says If you want to recover it from the hash, you need to have the abi of that contract, and then use it to match.
undefined says Thank you for your response and sorry it takes me some time to research and understand abi and other concepts you mentioned above. I have 2 follow up questions:
- Seems like the abi of a contract isn't available from on-chain data (data that I can download from RPC) but only from 3rd party, for example Etherscan?
- Even if I have the abi of a contract, there's no function that give me the event's name directly but rather I have to "match" the name base on the signature of the event? (I have tried to run this: https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.3/web3-eth-abi.html#decodelog but it only return event's signature, not event's name)
undefined says For the first question: yes, for the second one, you perhaps hard to decode the event’s name from it hash, because reverse hash is impossible, however, if you have the abi of the contract, you can get them, because the abi includes the information of events.
undefined says I am trying to use the sdk to execute transaction on L1 to withdraw funds from L2, and I meet an error, if I passed a new transaction from L2 to execute: `yarn outbox-exec --txhash 0x5e86f659292a99f1a0xxxxxxx`. it will throw out an error: 
```
reason: 'processing response error',
code: 'SERVER_ERROR',
body:
      `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":54,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"batch doesn't exist"}}\n`,
```
so, how long should I wait to check its status? One hour after I send transaction on L2? Or this is a way I can have a check, as now, it seems like use `l2ToL1Msg.status(l2Provider)`
undefined says If you are using testnet, you need wait about 1 day, if you are using arbitrum one, you need to wait 8 days.
undefined says Emmm, In my case, I monitor all transactions call `outboundTransfer()`, and use sdk to check its status, if the transaction has been confirmed, my code will automatically execute to withdraw funds, so error comes, when I just send such transaction on L2, once it confirms, I use `l2ToL1Msg.status(l2Provider)` to check its status, it will throw out errors like above, after one hours, I will get a correct return value `1`, this mean `unconfrimed`. Hope I make myself clear
undefined says After your tx on l2 confirmed, you need wait the challenge period(on testnet, it is 1 day, on mainnet, it is 7-8 days), after those period, you can send send tx to outbox to redeem your l2-to-l1 tx.
undefined says Got it, thanks!
undefined says I run an Arbitrum Node following https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
My node was error and I want to delete it to reinstall.
How to delete Arbitrum Node?
undefined says docker stop <container_name>
docker rm <container_name>
undefined says then delete the mounted volume/folder
undefined says How come syncing an RPC node is so slow? Any way to speed it up?
undefined says We will reduce this time when we upgrade to nitro, for now, we don’t have a flag which used to make it faster.
undefined says Okay, thank you
undefined says How does one act as an active / defensive validator when running a node?
undefined says Validation is currently open for whitelisted users only fren
undefined says as a helpful estimation, what is Arbitrum Nitro's max TPS in comparison to Arbitrum One? average TPS would be helpful if max TPS is irrelevant. trying to guage the magnitude of increased throughput from arbitrum one to arbitrum nitro
undefined says Hi, we think tps is meaningless since different tx has different gas consumption. For arbitrum one, we have a arbgas limit per second for 120k, and for nitro devnet, we have l2 gas limit per second for 1m.
undefined says Thank you! What do you mean by I2?
undefined says l2 part gas, and we have l1 part gas, because for l2 tx, you should pay some gas fee for l1 since sequencer will put your tx’s data to l1.
undefined says Is Arbitrum's smart contract immutable like Ethereum? Meaning once deployed it can't be upgraded.
undefined says The same as ethereum, but you can use proxy way to upgrade your contract.
undefined says Why is there an asymmetry between finality times of deposits from L1 and withdrawals to L1?

When someone deposits L1 ETH to Arbitrum's bridge for transfer to L2, my understanding is that the L2 ETH is minted and available for use within an hour. But withdrawals from L2 to L1 have a 7-day waiting period (if a liquidity provider is not used).

What prevents a malicious operator from minting L2 ETH without a matching L1 deposit? Shouldn't there be a fault proof for transactions that mint L2 ETH?
undefined says Because l1’s finalize time will be shorter. For the funds withdraw from l2 to l1, we need wait the challenge window(7 days) to make sure that withdraw finalize, for l2 finalize, you can read: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says Let me try to explain my confusion
1. `depositEth` is called by a user wanting to deposit L1 ETH to Arbitrum. 
     Link to `depositEth` code https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L220

2. `depositEth` calls `_deliverMessage` which in turn calls `deliverToBridge` which calls `bridge.deliverMessageToInbox`
       Link to `deliverMessageToInbox` in `Bridge.sol` https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Bridge.sol#L58

3. `deliverMessageToInbox` calls `addMessageToInbox` which pushes a new hash value into the `inboxAccs` array.
 Link to relevant code.  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Bridge.sol#L97

4. The L1 part of `depositEth` **seems** to end with step 3 described above. There has to be some action on L2 which mints the L2 ETH. Something like the method `L2ArbitrumGateway.finalizeInboundTransfer`. This seems to apply to ERC20. I couldn't find an analogous ETH method.
   Link to relevant code:  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ArbitrumGateway.sol#L228

5. The L1 transaction finalization time applies to the `depositEth` (IIUC). But shouldn't the L2 finalization time apply to the L2 action that mints the L2 ETH? If the L2 ETH minting is an L2 transaction, then it could be done incorrectly and be subject to a fault proof. Am I missing something here?
undefined says For examples, from A chain to B chain, we just needs to wait the the cross chain message finalize on A chain then we can release the funds to the users on B chain, then the user can have such token on B chain, if users want security, they can also wait until his on board tx finalize on b chain, but he still use that token when his on board tx confirmed by network. In your words, the l2 mint tx is a l2 tx, we just only let it happens then we can finalize it, so it depends on user whether them want the most security or not.
undefined says For the point 4, the reason why you don’t see ethers’ function is because it is a normal eth send transaction, not like erc20, we should mint it first and then call transfer. You can see how it works here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages
undefined says Also, once your tx included in inbox, it won’t revert any more, because your tx order is confirmed on l1(unless l1 revert), anyone can read l1’s inbox and get the latest state.
undefined says Thanks for this answer. Let me rephrase to check my understanding. L1 ETH deposits get added to the Inbox immediately. On the other hand, L2 states (Rollup Nodes) are added to the Inbox after the 7-day waiting period. Is this right?
undefined says L2 state will post to l1’s outbox contract not inbox contract. Inbox contract is used to post the l2’s tx information and l1-to-l2 tx, outbox is used to execute l2-to-l1 tx. Others are right.
undefined says Thanks for the clarification
undefined says Is there anything different about building smart contracts on Nova? Do you have to interact with the DACs?
undefined says you don't need to interact with DAC
undefined says there are some breaking changes
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#breaking-changes
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs can you confirm the validity of the new bridge UI?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/996841013903622175
undefined says confirmed
undefined says 
undefined says haha yes it's legit
undefined says :salute:
undefined says thanks -- trying to understand the different roles within the Arbitrum system.  Arbitrum full node operators who are currently whitelisted can act as validators: how many active / defensive / watchtower validators are there (https://medium.com/offchainlabs/fraud-proofs-and-validators-how-you-or-anyone-can-keep-arbitrum-honest-d68add3f6c5d)?  Can you describe in more detail what is required of each from a technical standpoint?  I.e., what does it mean for an active validator to "advance the state of the chain" -- what functions on the arb client are they calling to do this?  Similarly, how do defensive validators detect fraud -- what modules implement this functionality?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#validators
undefined says With AnyTrust Is it worth considering allowing a developer to choose whether the data for a tx is stored on L1 or off-chain. This would enable a project to receive higher security guarantees for economic transactions and lower security for less critical activities and high volume activities.
undefined says Hi, thanks for your suggestion, this is a good thinking, but it may be a little complex when others want to collect the da because they need to sync from onchain and offchain and make sure the order is right, also for wallet ui will need more implementation to ask users which type da to use when send tx. So we decide to use 2 chains(nitro and nova) to meet those needs by separate chains.
undefined says I thought you must be doing this anyway as you fallback to the rollup approach in certain scenarios.
undefined says that's different because when falling back to rollup you still assume at least 1 of the committee member is honest that can provide the data
undefined says So the data never gets published to L1, I must have misunderstood.
undefined says Hashes of the data are, as signed by n-1 of the committee members
undefined says This is unlike Nitro where the actual data itself is stored on L1.
undefined says What ports are required to be open for a normal RPC node?
undefined says I cant find this in the `docs/running_node`
undefined says So I have an ERC20 token that is distributed by a smart contract on Arbitrum. The plan is to have users bridge this ERC20 token back to the mainnet where they will be able to interact with a smart contract that will allow them to pay 100 tokens to mint an ERC-721. I just want to make sure that this is something that is possible, since the ERC20 contract is not on the mainnet. When accepting payment through the mainnet nft contract, I would just use the address of the ERC20 contract on Arbitrum correct? If that isn't an issue then everything should work just fine, but if not, I will have to find a workaround.
undefined says as a Nova-approved dev, am I allowed to share gas-fee estimates publicly on twitter? or is there some sort of honor-system NDA while Nova is in whitelist-only?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node#important-ports
undefined says So you will have a token that mint in L2 and want to be able to bridge to L1, correct?
undefined says I don't think there are any restrictions in this regards, but would recommend to wait until Nova have more activity for meaningful fee estimate since L1 cost would go down significantly when there are more transaction in a batch.
undefined says The erc20’s are on arbitrum but need to be moved to L1
undefined says sweet 😄 ill be sure to disclose the fact that nova has low activity
undefined says Does your token implement IArbToken?
undefined says I believe so
undefined says Ok, you can see this docs how to bridge it: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway, and here is the code examples: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging. After those process, you will have this token deployed on l1 and l2, and users can bridge it using our official bridge, users just need use the l1 side to interact with your l1 contract is ok.
undefined says hey Jason it is more complicated if they want to mint in L2
undefined says for now, you would need to deploy a custom gateway that can mint extra supply on L1, or manually mint supply on L1 and send to the bridge
undefined says the L2 token need to implement https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/0dee42b7ce4684fd367090582c32878cec9b45b9/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol#L41 to return the L1 token address if you want to use ArbCustomGateway, and the L1 token need to implement https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/0dee42b7ce4684fd367090582c32878cec9b45b9/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/ICustomToken.sol#L34 to register to custom gateway
undefined says @Mixer
undefined says No these are not node communication ports right, for example for geth it can be 30303, these important ports are just for ws and http rpc etc.
undefined says Arbitrum nodes don’t have p2p mode and just need to listen to sequencer feed.
undefined says Oh got it, ty
undefined says Np
undefined says test
undefined says greeter
undefined says error
undefined says it won't let me send description of my error
undefined says I'm trying to run the greeter sample
undefined says getting error on estimaete submsssion fee
undefined says just to clarify, the arbitrum on rinkeby (I'm using Alchemy RPC) is Nitro or not?
undefined says Nitro has not been released yet.
undefined says Of course it is currently a testnet.
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/public_nitro_devnet
undefined says some feedback: docs says Nitro will one day be deployed on the Rinkeby testnet and then mainnet. So when I come into this ecosystem, I don't know if this already happened or not and whether my sdk lib version will work or not
undefined says as mentionde, the greeter example does not work out of the box
undefined says based on mismatching function names, I found that greeter is written against SDK 3.0.0-beta (which assumes Nitro) but references v2
undefined says trying to calculate TVL on arbitrum one. can all value on the chain be traced back to the official bridge deposits or is that a bad assumption?
undefined says Im assuming all non-official bridges had to fill their arbitrum pools by going through the official bridge first
undefined says is there a timeline on de-whitelisting validator nodes so anyone can submit fraud proofs?
undefined says Here's an example of one someone built already 🙂 https://dune.com/springzhang/arbitrum-overview
undefined says we just pushed a fix, examples in arbitrum-tutorial repo use sdk ^2.0.0, which works with both classic and nitro
undefined says Is the testnet still active?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/997629184727855195
undefined says Yes it has always active.
undefined says Just follow Rinkeby or migrate.
undefined says You can check the link above for details.
undefined says How can i contract team member
undefined says would like to be the market maker in Abitrum
undefined says does a node propagate transactions to other nodes or just relays then direct to the seq?
undefined says Just forward to sequencer, there is no p2p node in arbitrum network.
undefined says ahhh ok so the seq must just seq transactions in chronological order?
undefined says yup
undefined says Can I contract you for the market makter discussion on Arbitrum ?
undefined says Suppose I sell a book and accept L2 ETH as payment. The buyer sends funds to my Arbitrum wallet. I ship the book as soon as I see the funds. Is it possible that the funds are returned to the buyer because the L2 block containing their transaction was proved to be incorrect in the next 7 days?
undefined says You can wait when the tx is recorded on l1, then it will never revert, it only takes about 3-5 minutes, you can see related docs here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Is the quick finality because of sequencer mode? If an L2 tx recorded on L1 will never revert, why does this rule not apply to L2 transactions that request withdrawal of funds to L1? Why do such transactions need to wait for 7 days?
undefined says When your tx recorded to l1, which means your order is confirmed and will not change, anyone can get the right state when the read l1. But which doesn’t mean we can promise every state is the right state, neither as validators, so we should have 7 days to let others to check. If you can make sure your state is right when your tx recorded on l1, then you can just ship your book.
undefined says Thanks once again for your prompt reply. I guess liquidity providers use this mechanism (of checking that the L2 state is correct when an L2-to-L1 withdrawal tx is recorded on L1) before they help users exit their L2 funds to L1.
undefined says correct
undefined says comparatively to arbitrum one, about how much can we expect in gas fees on anytrust?
undefined says from what i've heard 10-50x cheaper than arbitrum one
undefined says which would mean $0.01 or less potentially
undefined says ty kindly
undefined says Thank youb
undefined says My friend has been using my node recently, but there is always such a mistake, and then the height of the node can not catch up, I want to know how to avoid this problem, thank you!

undefined says Does the view/pure function he called complex?
undefined says We set the default max call gas to 5000000
undefined says Why the runing time so long?
undefined says Will it be better if we set it higher?
undefined says and in top|grep arb
top -Hp thisnumebr, there are a lot of arb-node
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs harry can you have a check on this?
undefined says Really appreciate it
undefined says Is there a call or something that I can do to determine that my Arbitrum node is fully sync'd and archive enabled?
undefined says I suppose we are connected in slack now
undefined says I'm trying to work out gas limit to empty an account of all its ETH. Estimate gas returns 10000 for the value send. With a gas price of 516945490 that should add up to 5169454900000 wei (0.0000051694549 ETH). The account has 0.0000612308387435 ETH (more), but still runs out of gas with `not enough funds for gas`
undefined says If a sequencer censors a user's withdrawal transactions on L2, the user can go through the delayed inbox. But what can users do if the sequencer stops operating the L2 chain? 

zkSync has something called Exodus Mode that gets activated if an exit request is unprocessed for 14 days. Once exodus mode is activated, the L2 chain is paused and invidual users can exit by proving ownership of their funds. Is there something similar in Arbitrum? Of course it would have to work without ZKPs.
undefined says Hmm, are you using arbitrum testnet?
undefined says Mainnet
undefined says If sequencer is not work, you can still send tx to delayed inbox, and this tx can be a l2-to-l1 initiate tx. Then you can force this tx to be included to sequencer inbox. So your tx will finally on arbitrum, then validators will stake your l2-to-l1 tx, after the challenge window, you can get your funds back.
undefined says Your gas price is 5169454900000 wei which is 5169gwei which is impossible (currently is around 0.25gwei), also, it’s hard to let an address’ value be 0, because the estimateGas return is a little higher and so do eth_gasPrice, so use this way won’t let an address to be null.
undefined says Thanks again. I have two followup questions. 
1. Is the `sendL2Message` method in `Inbox.sol` used to add the L2-to-L1 initiate withdrawal tx to the delayed inbox?
    Link: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/83624c9e5a600f8bdba7ab0bd3eadf5f989ca493/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L76
2. Is the `executeTransaction` method in `Outbox.sol` used to get the funds back after the challenge window?
    Link: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/83624c9e5a600f8bdba7ab0bd3eadf5f989ca493/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Outbox.sol#L148
undefined says 1. `sendL2Message` is a `L1 to L2 message` and can contain a `L2-to-L1 message` to initiate withdrawal tx, but it would be easier and safer to do so with `unsafeCreateRetryableTicket`
2. `executeTransaction` method is used to execute any outgoing message from L2 to L1 after the dispute time. These outgoing transaction can be a refund transaction from L2 to L1, or also can be a call to another smart contract in L1 with a `calldata` (pre-specified calldata in the outgoing message).
undefined says I am looking to speak with someone in the developer support team to learn about support needs at Arbitrum and explore a potential partnership between Helix and Arbitrum.  Helix is a protocol that rewards community members for answering questions. I was not sure which channel to post this on. So, posting it here. Would love to get routed to the right person and discuss in detail.
undefined says partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says ‎‏I double checked with my colleague. For the first question, It’s ok if user sends L2MSG (i.e using sendL2Message method), because using retryable unsigned tx to the l2 will let the l1 sender’s address aliased, so it hard for him to withdraw his l2 address’ funds.
undefined says Thanks for the clarification.
undefined says Here's a more complete example. I'm trying to (near) empty the account 0xA5E688E65b2A428eCd06AddCAF311197a019C1C7. As you can see on Arbiscan, it has a balance of 0.01 ETH. I make this TX:

```
{
    "to": "0xA1E6f3313535205eA1F983B973D27c7Bd4327229",
    "gas": "0x2710",
    "value": "0x2381a18536ecc0",
    "nonce": "0x0",
    "gasPrice": "0x22d6e674",
    "chainId": 42161
}
```

For that TX above, `[Value]  + [Gas Price] * [Gas Limit] = 0x2381a18536ecc0 + 0x22d6e674 * 0x2710 = 10000000000000000 (0.01 ETH)`, but the TX fails with `not enough funds for gas`

Is there some other gas usage charged for L1 that's not included in this math?
undefined says Looking at some random txs on Arbiscan, they're using ~500K gas on value sends. I'm guessing the gas estimate for value sends is incorrect?
undefined says Gas estimate is a little higher than the actual paid because the gas used will change if l1’s gas price change
undefined says As I said, it’s hard for you to get the actual gas used before your tx comfirmed(not like l1, it will always be 21k), so it’s hard to empty an account’s balance by doing this way.
undefined says Anyone knows how to debug arbi mainnet error tx using tx hash? any recommend tools?
undefined says You could view your tx details on the arbiscan and get a rough idea about why it failed/reverted. For further debugging you could use tools like tenderly.
undefined says Thanks sir! I found tenderly works well for arbi
undefined says Anyone knows why the error occurs? https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x54597e90625ef07ccb2bf39d9e7952fe19a03753e7d56138029b23061ae26833

I called claimAll() method for the Magic dragon dao staking contract, but it failed (reverted). It looks not contract issue, but arbi issue. 

The same action works well in the tenderly simulation for arbi
undefined says 
undefined says In Tenderly You've provided 8 million gas limit but in the original tx you've provided 5 million. The contract needs to consume around 5,956,348 gas for your transaction.
You can resend your transaction to Arbitrum mainnet and change the gas limit manually in Metamask to 8 million and it will be executed.
undefined says It’s not worked even if gas limit is 50million
undefined says I also executed it for 8million
undefined says Update: MDD announced related problem and decided to change their contract logic to lower the gas consumption. Current MDD trigger arbi 'speed limit' : https://discord.com/channels/934927457339965460/935558047428919326/999096889574178836
undefined says Yes, we have a limit for arbgas per second which is 2.4m.
undefined says How I check nitro node?
undefined says What do you mean by check?
undefined says use: docker ps command
undefined says How can update node?
undefined says Could you clarify what do you mean by "update node"?
undefined says Hey guys, apologies if this is not the right place for this question. I've been learning solidity and writing out some contracts for an idea I've had for a project. What I wanted was to have NFTs on ETH mainnet, and then have a simple game built on Arbitrum, that would require ownership of a specific nft token on the mainnet. I believe this is possible, but I haven't really found any good info to walk me through what would take/how to do that. Does anyone have something handy, or know of some example of something like this that I could drink from?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages should help you @sharktails and i know these guys do exactly that https://twitter.com/samurisenft?s=21&t=5hg311A3lCu6juQx_wqfxA
undefined says what type of l1 node do we need to run `arb-node` - archive or full?
undefined says Thanks, I'll check it out!
undefined says You need a full node.
undefined says To add to @hunter | Offchain Labs . There are bunch of tutorials for working with Arbitrum in this repo which may be helpful:

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says tyvm!
undefined says How to setup archive node? Exists github issue 1898. But without response
undefined says --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000
undefined says My node is synced, but literally every call gets reverted, while this exact program works on mainnet etc. These are simple calls like fetching a token symbol or getting uniswap pair reserves.
undefined says Any idea?
undefined says Apparently this log shows they reverted, but I do actually get the data it seems, interesting.
undefined says Are you running nitro node? Can you check your address called is right?
undefined says can someone explain the difference between `_challengedSegmentStart` and `_gasUsedBefore` here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/challenge/Challenge.sol#L151-L154 ? it seems like they should always be equivalent (despite the difference in the param documentation)
undefined says It works, it just shows reverted in my node logs
undefined says I wanna know why I get a **transaction hash: 0xefc4b1845f162fd61b496766c69fc0da9ee1317f0153efa30b3cb30d8f7884ba**
from the raw data of the node, and the value is **15945104416635261000000000000000000000000000000** , it 's not normal
undefined says This tx was failed
undefined says thanks
undefined says Hey, I want to deploy a time sensitive contract on Arbitrum, is there a way I can get timestamp as real-time as possible?
undefined says It’s hard to process timestamp on chain, you can see how we process the timestamp on arbitrum here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/time_in_arbitrum
undefined says this is going to change after nitro migration
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/6f4086833d8b508cc14a5ee8dc7225532829948b/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md?plain=1#L19
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Thank you, is there an ETA for when will Nitro go live on mainnet?
undefined says No specific time.
undefined says Wait patiently.
undefined says bump
undefined says They might differ because some instructions use more than 1 gas, so a bisection might be in the middle of an instruction's execution essentially.
undefined says What are the big problems facing optimistic rollups?
undefined says probably narrative
undefined says people still think ZKRs are superior
undefined says (opinion from a non-dev) lol
undefined says ZKRs are superior in some ways, in many ways, they're not. Especially after things like Risc0 are built out, it will fun to see its performance against nitro. The main problem I see for them is after DA is solved, since ZK proving times are so much higher that pure execution they will likely have a lot less throughput than any of their OR competitors
undefined says Any technical/research problems? Just need fun things to think about 🙂
undefined says How about much it costs to actually aquire the hardware required alongside the proving costs to submit a proof for every batch
undefined says 👀
undefined says and lets not even mention how far away they are from being at the state where ORs are today
undefined says agreed. ORs will be way cheaper after DA is solved. ZKR users are gonna pay for those proofs and hardware costs. Ideally, proofs are a constant amount of computation per batch so they can be "amortized" over a bunch of transactions. Can't argue with the underlying point tho haha
undefined says lol yeah truely interested to see
undefined says what type of PMF zkrs are going to see when they finally come out
undefined says Yeah, the extra assumptions that ORs rely on are relatively insignificant IMO, they have the ease of use, malleability, and power that ZKRs have been striving for. The way ZKRs might win a bit is in a crossrollup-ethereum composable world where different applications want instant composability with other applications on different rollups when they aren't on a general composability like arbitrum one or optimism.
undefined says agreed. these guys are building a stark based risc instruction set https://www.risc0.com/ idk how much vaporware it is, but people are trying to zk general instruction. prover will prob be horrendous tho 🙂
undefined says But yeah, if there's a good place to read/learn about about some of the technical and research questions Arbitrum and ORs are facing would love to get my hands dirty!
undefined says couple of places for you my fren

undefined says and ofcourse #🔗︱links has plenty of more links
undefined says tyty
undefined says What datacenter is the sequencer located? aws us-west-2?
undefined says It’s in us, but we can provide more details.
undefined says Why is the forced inclusion period 1 day? What stops it from being in the next/next-next batch?
undefined says If you just send tx to sequencer or send to delayed inbox, you will have a faster inclusion when sequencer alive. But for delayed inbox, if sequencer doesn’t include your tx, you need wait for delay block time for some security reasons, you can see details here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says Yep, the makes it more precise thanks. But why isn't the sequencer required to include it after 10ish minutes (or 20 for its next batch)? Why allow the sequencer to delay for a period as long as a day?
undefined says Also, on anytrust chains, how to anytrust nodes come to consensus on the correct rollup block?
undefined says Force include can be called by anyone, this is used to include tx if sequencer doesn’t include your tx. If you just send normal tx in delayed inbox, sequencer will include your tx around 5-10 minutes later.
undefined says You mean the anytrust da group node right? They just make BLS signature on the da, they don’t signature to the state, so they don’t need to have such a consensus. The state is still signed by validators.
undefined says From the docs it looks like, if the sequencer is nice, you get 5-10 min delays and up to 1 day? why cant we just have anyone include tx into inbox after 10 mins?
undefined says Does a sequencer post the data to the anytrust DAC and they sign off on the DA and state update?
undefined says This is for security reason, we need give sequencer enough time to notice this tx, and if the time window is not long, sequencer might include them on its local state(but not pushed this batch to l1 yet) and meanwhile user force include this tx on l1, this might affect the state on sequencer, because sequencer need to re-execute those tx in the same batch which will also cause other full node’s state, so we choose a long enough time for delays block number.
undefined says They just sign off the da. State is still staked by validators as arbitrum one.
undefined says gotcha, would be cool to lower this for faster guaranteed composability with L1 and other rollups 🙂 I'm sure 1 day is a huge safety precaution
undefined says ah, so are fraud proofs still active then? if the data is available, then watchers can submit fraud proofs?
undefined says Yup, the only difference between anytrust and nitro is the process way of da.
undefined says is it fair to say anytrust is like an optimistic validium?
undefined says Ah, I think so.
undefined says also, if anytrust already relies on a 19/20 honest assumption for liveness, have you thought of implementing a 19/20 threshold encryption scheme on transactions to guarantee the sequencer is blind to the contents of transactions (other than size)? would be good for assuring fair ordering since there is no decipherable value from encrypted transactions
undefined says Yes, you can read here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/inside_anytrust.md#keysets
undefined says Oh, you mean pbs way?
undefined says Ah, I wasn't clear. I'm proposing something different. Since Anytrust relies on a 19/20 honest assumption for liveness, we could just have users send their transactions to the sequencer encrypted by a 19/20 public key (it can only be decrypted if 19/20 of the anytrust nodes agree do to so). Then the sequencer doesn't have knowledge of transactions since they are encrypted, and the DAC only decrypts batches when the sequencer commits to including their contents.
undefined says yea sorta 🙂
undefined says this is similar in spirit to the technique used by penumbra (https://protocol.penumbra.zone/main/zswap.html) but much less complicated because the underlying crypto doesnt need to be as powerful also looks like a project called shutter is looking into this: https://github.com/shutter-network/shutter
undefined says Ah we haven’t made this yet, but yea, this is a good idea to implement fair ordering.
undefined says i'm confused
- this indicates that `challengedSegmentStart` and `challengedSegmentLength` are in terms of **avm gas** https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/rollup/RollupLib.sol#L137-L141
- however, the param documentation indicates that those parameters are in terms of the **number of messages**  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/challenge/Challenge.sol#L141-L142
which is it actually?

this documentation also says avm gas https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#the-real-dissection-protocol, so seems like it's the former?
undefined says What are the hardware requirements for an arbitrum node?
undefined says r5d.2xlarge is recommended.
undefined says Checking on this.
undefined says Those contracts will be deprecated with the nitro upgrade.
there is no more bisectionChunkHash
here are the new ones
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/challenge/ChallengeLib.sol . But yea, the comment in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/challenge/Challenge.sol#L141-L142 is not correct.
undefined says If we want to build a DeFi app that requires high performance, should we consider Nova? Or Nova is recommended for nft/gaming only because of the lower security?
undefined says And what's the average finality of transactions on Nova?
undefined says And when is Nova expected to be fully launched?(open to users)
undefined says it depends on what level of security guarantee you need
undefined says better than most major alt-L1s
undefined says and could you help with other questions?
undefined says and what could be the average gas cost for each transaction?
undefined says I would be forever grateful if someone could help me explain how the Arbitrum native ETH Bridge works. I'm going through this Dune Query and realised Arbitrum is different to other bridges. 

Does anyone know where I can find docs on the Arbitrum Inbox?

Here's the Dune Query for reference (specificfaly lines 386-408): https://dune.com/queries/118245/284806
undefined says potench https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets
undefined says How big the memory needed to run a node of arbitrum one?
I have a aws ec2 with 32GB memory for running a node.
and after about one month, the node is taking more than 90% of memory, and still increasing.
Is there any memory leak in the node program?
undefined says thanks very helpful, is there a changelog I can find somewhere for the L1 contract changes from arbitrum v1->nitro btw? besides the obvious avm->wasm stuff

also some unsolicited feedback: I've spent quite some time auditing the arbitrum contracts and find the documentation to be very sparse (and as above, sometimes incorrect) in many places. eg clear function/params documentation could go a long way
undefined says Thanks for your feedback! For the contract change log, we now have this docs: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#protocol-contracts, but if you think it’s not enough, you can see our nitro contract codebase:  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/master/contracts/src
undefined says We recommend 64gb, 32gb may cause OOM.
undefined says Hey folks! Can somebody advice. How to calculated transaction fee? For example: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x5c7842d8220957c5ba4cdf11a78c03c3363368f9c9d4c50b42f72a3379c0411f
``` 0.00066567905543 ETH ``` ?
74591906 * 892428 = 66567905487768 ?
undefined says Use `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, then calculate by add the four value in `feeStats.paid`
undefined says Thank you for your reply:
11000814296880+311555473245936+343122767894400 + 0 = 665679055437216 

according to explorer: 66567905543
?
undefined says how about hardware for running  Rinkeby Nitro Node & Goerli Nitro Node  each other ?
undefined says Maybe the link below will help you.
https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413938850075-What-s-the-hardware-requirements-to-run-the-full-node-
https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/README.md#hardware-requirements
undefined says what's the current behavior if two sibling assertions are created by two stakers and both are correct? or is that disallowed somehow by the rollup contract?
undefined says if they are both correct they would be the same assertion
undefined says what does that mean? what is stopping two validators from calling `stakeOnNewNode` individually on the same parent node, resulting in two children nodes (siblings) that are equivalent? the reason this is a problem in my view is only one of the two nodes can be confirmed. the other has to be challenged before it is allowed to be confirmed, but any challenge would fail.
undefined says Anyone having issues with arbiscan API? I’m getting no response from getLogs endpoint. 

(Even when using the sample call from the docs)
undefined says Working now!
undefined says it depends on your trust assumption
if you trust the sequencer, finality is like 1 second
otherwise you would need to wait for the transaction batch to be posted on L1, in Nova it is ~ 1 hour 
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/tx_lifecycle
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/finality
undefined says in the next week or 2
undefined says with enough traffic the L1 cost will be minimal and you will only be paying L2 cost at 0.1 gwei gas price lowest
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/346a2d1dd0370330c73b771f98ec87d4c79dfe48/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L589
the transaction to create the 2nd assertion would revert because the hash wouldn't match
undefined says Hey, just curious if the code being run by the actual sequencer is public at all? All I can find is this dev sequencer at https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-rpc-node/cmd/arb-dev-sequencer/arb-dev-sequencer.go but wanting to study a bit more specifically what it does behind the scenes in production
undefined says Slightly more specifically, looking to find the code where the sequencer handles incoming transactions sent via RPC
undefined says How are things with the tasks of the second third week?
undefined says its the same code as non-sequencing node
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-node-core
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-rpc-node
undefined says Can I use this to estimate L1<-->L2 gas conversion?

I basically want to calculate the amount of gas that would be spent for an Arbitrum transaction if the transaction was instead sent on L1.


For example, consider these two transactions. Both approve MAGIC token. One on Arbitrum, one on L1.

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x2f35d7eac86381f0e9bffaa568b547a79c0e64ee2cf2273c4c74a0e40dc7245d 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x55f0be47ced0a17e34b8c334c2b492786a6f01e1c654e487399091ece5f2b203

Arbitrum transaction has spent 1516 computational arbgas.
Ethereum transaction has spent 51,922 - 21,000 = 30,922 gas.

How do I convert the Arbitrum gas to Ethereum gas? Or at least estimate it? Is it possible? I've been working on this for ages and I'd really appreciate some help.
undefined says Simply put I just want to get the total gas cost of EVM instructions executed in a transaction
undefined says (Without forking the chain or re-executing the transactions and other similar ways)
undefined says Hi, I don’t think it’s easy to use a ratio to convert l1-l2 gas, we have such an AVM instruction cost here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification#instructions. But good news is when we upgrade to nitro, we will have same cost on l2 gas cost as l1: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#cool-new-stuff
undefined says This is GREAT news and made my day. ~~So to confirm, ArbGas won't be a thing in Nitro? 
Does it mean that ETH transfer will take 21,000 gas?~~ Just checked the link, look's like it, thanks!
undefined says Hey, I have one final question. I see that eth_getTransactionReceipt returns a "feeStats" object, and below it "prices", which includes l1Transaction, l1Calldata, l2Storage, and l2Computation.

If I want to get the L1 gas price (as set by ArbOs) for a given transaction, should I just convert "l1Calldata" to gwei?
undefined says I know about arbgas info precompile but I can't use it since it only retuns the latest data and not historical
undefined says can someone explain how arbitrum's challenge contract handles the case where the bisection cuts through the gas of a single instruction (like if an instruction spans multiple segments)
undefined says hey, can somebody help me understand how arbgas is related to other EVM's gas consumptions?
undefined says If I look at this tx on arbiscan I see that it consumed 34037 arbgas
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc15bcd046b35d748189c3921d76e528df387ffc710389c83724c03c02b3090c8#txninfo
undefined says Now from experience I know that in other EVMs that would certainly be to little gas to complete that many actions
undefined says now I found in the arbi docs that the conversion rate between Arbgas and AVM gas is 100
undefined says so if I now want to know how much computational gas units have been used by this transaction in "standard" VMs, would I just multiply this by 100?
undefined says so the "true EVM" gas consumption would be ``34307 * 100 = 3430700``
undefined says that doesn't really make sense to me either, that's way too much
undefined says I just reread the relevant part of the docs and it says that Ethereum gas and ArbGas are not comparable due to other differences as well, would be great if somebody can confirm that my thinking above here is indeed wrong and there is no real way to compare "compute units"
undefined says Is there a way to query all tokens on the Arbitrum chain?
undefined says do you mean erc-20's? i'd imagine something like dune could help you with that
undefined says it could help with querying really any on-chain data
undefined says @cc ok ill give it a try
undefined says This is AVM instructions table: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/avm_specification#instructions
undefined says Yes, but we have set 15% higher than actual l1 gas prices
undefined says I run a arb  node in my machine, how to request block from my node with curl
undefined says Just use eth’s rpc method.
undefined says but I found some error:       "error":{"code":-32601,"message":"the method eth_syncing does not exist/is not available"}} ,
undefined says Yea, we don’t support this rpc, you can try eth_blockNumber.
undefined says oh, it's ok,  make me confuse that  I found the l2Block and l1Block is behind the value.
undefined says How many blocks behind?
undefined says I'm sorry , I have a mistake.  the blocks is fine.
undefined says thanks so much!
undefined says Hi! I'm wondering that where do I suppose to ask some questions about Arbitrum Nova?
undefined says You can just ask here
undefined says Thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs !
undefined says For Arbitrum Nova, I have two questions listed below.

1. The DAC seems to be a good approach for avoiding the challenge period in Arbitrum One and lowering down the gas cost. Therefore, DAC is responsible for guarantee the security of all the layer 2 transactions. For now, how many members are there in DAC? And who or which institutions can apply to be the DAC members? 

2. In the medium article, the offchain lab encouraged the gaming and social applications to build on top of Arbitrum Nova. Is Defi applications also recommended to build on top of Nova? Is there any potential security risk or trade-off that we will need to take into consideration when we want to build our Defi apps on Arbitrum Nova?
undefined says hi, 
1. Dac doesn’t sign for the state, they just sign for the guarantee of the da, which means they just make a promise the have stored the related data, the stake is still staked by validator, so the challenge window still exists.
2. For defi, we recommend you to use arbitrum one( it will upgrade to nitro stack)
undefined says Thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs for the reply!

I am still wondering that how many members are there in DAC? And who or which institutions can apply to be the DAC members?
undefined says We haven’t public those details yet.
undefined says OK, thx
undefined says Is there any way to get trace from node
undefined says --node.rpc.tracing.enable
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says But after nitro upgrade, we will change the trace rpc to geth’s standard.
undefined says I try to use  trace_rawTransaction,  but  it send me some error :   {"code":-32601,"message":"the method trace_rawTransaction does not exist/is not available"}}
undefined says Yea, you should restart you node and with those flags I sent to you.
undefined says we run the node with docker and that flag has been added before start
undefined says 
undefined says Change method to `arbtrace_call`,  trace_rawTransaction is not supported.
undefined says 
undefined says Example: `curl http://arbnode -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"arbtrace_call","params":[{"to": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f","data": "0x70a082310000000000000000000000006E0d01A76C3Cf4288372a29124A26D4353EE51BE"},["trace"], "latest"],"id":67}'` please check your params field.
undefined says it means that I can't use   Transaction Hash  as data to request
undefined says https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module
undefined says If so, you should take a look at parity’s docs and rename trace_* to arbtrace_*
undefined says unlike openethereum,  arb-node  have no the flag  --tracing on,   thank your help!
undefined says Oh, that docs just show how to use that rpc. To turn it on, you need flow our docs’ way. Np!
undefined says as you said ,  turn on the flag in openethereum as l1 ,the arb-node will support the method  trace_rawTransaction, right?
undefined says Hmm, use --node.rpc.tracing.enable to turn it on your arb node (which you have already done), for how to use it, you can flow the docs I sent to you, it shows how to use trace_xx method, and when you use it on arb node, the difference is you need change trace_xxx to arbtrace_xxx
undefined says I see, I read the doc your sent  to me that I found the method (trace_rawTransaction)  that  arb-node not support is what I want most.
undefined says How about change to arbtrace_rawTransaction or arbtrace_transaction?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says it should be
arbtrace_transaction and arbtrace_block
undefined says could you supply some case to show how to use of the arbtrace_transaction
undefined says ```
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"arbtrace_transaction",
    "params":["0x497984f079f6887e579b611e039096f9b3eecea21d96a1da94a879634b11af79"
    ],
    "id":1
}
```
undefined says oh, it is tracing a transaction hash
I don't think we have rawTransaction support with arbtrace api, let me double check
undefined says When this bug: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/issues/1823 will be fixed ?
undefined says it is not a bug, and the performance of classic arb-node is unlikely to be improved in the near future; when we migrate to nitro node the startup time will be significantly improved
undefined says you can use arbtrace_call tho, you would have to decode the raw transaction externally
```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "arbtrace_call",
    "params": [
        {
            "to": "0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f",

```
undefined says thx
undefined says Is it possible to decrease a startup time using program arguments(caches for example etc.)? My node spend 1h2mins for starting.
undefined says nope
undefined says why would anyone want to trace a txn on arbitrum?
undefined says there is no mempool, right?
undefined says debug
undefined says You mean txn pool? We don’t have it.
undefined says tenderly supports arbitrum.
undefined says bump
undefined says I believe the state won't change unless the instruction is completed
undefined says I am having problems deploying a contract on arbitrum mainnet. 
I have succesfully deployed this contract before on Goerli and arbitrum testnet no problems. I can provide addresses.
The error when deploying is: Uncaught ProviderError: execution reverted: error code 255
undefined says Arbitrum testnet: https://rinkeby-explorer.arbitrum.io/address/0x63E978f8C647bAA71184b9eCcB39e0509C09D681/transactions
undefined says Any support on that error code will be appreciated.
undefined says Could you share the whole error you got?
undefined says 
undefined says I was trying to bump up gas limits here, no success...
undefined says What ethers version are you using?
undefined says ethers": "^5.4.4" and "hardhat": "^2.6.0"
undefined says Just now I was able to deploy it after like 3 hours of attempting. Not sure if you guys did something but it worked now 🥳 .
undefined says Good to hear that!
undefined says Currently going through DD process for Arbitrum before we (trading firm) plunge money in the L2.
undefined says Is there a **public** audit available for Arbitrum's official bridge? If not, we will need to use other bridges but from what I know, the all 3rd-party bridges still use the minted assets from the official bridge? Just faster deposit/withdrawal
undefined says there are no public audit yet; and yes most 3rd party bridge use the same asset
undefined says Nova open public next week ?
undefined says https://medium.com/offchainlabs/introducing-nova-arbitrum-anytrust-mainnet-is-open-for-developers-9a54692f345e
undefined says Why I would choose arbitrum and not immutable x , the gas fees on nova seems to high to me . also this medium dont give much infomation about nova
undefined says seeing on explorer gas fees around 0.005$ , which still not useable for gaming trading items in big numbers ~
undefined says For gaming, you can choose Nitro
undefined says nova is based on nitro tech too
undefined says the fee will be lower when there are more activity because the fixed cost can be shared between users
undefined says for one, much better evm support for smart contracts and composability
undefined says is this the correct address for the Challenge contract? Has there really been no challenges? https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ad1dc4ab5475d9f8cd10118c9d28b06f0c8a2d9
undefined says Thanks for correcting.
undefined says This is challenge contract, the challenge only happens when there is a validator thinking others is cheating, but for now, no validators cheated yet.
undefined says How do you calculate the `L1 calldata price * L1 calldata size` when redeeming a ticket? (within the context of this article https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9)

As an example, here is a `redeem()` tx, which executes a `distribute()` tx:

* redeem: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe896b16b635ed76c0b67e275970c581483baf081dc3556007853443c6467e6a9
* distribute: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xcb8ff8c338c63cbcf4ba9e965b0ffdda68c0b5673d118955f2873e80607dc533

My understanding is that the `L1 calldata price` is `16` (cost for L1 calldata) multiplied by the current L1 `gasPrice`, `x`. My understanding of the `L1 calldata size` would just be the `redeem_calldata.length() + distribute_calldata.length()`, or  `37 + 198 = 235`. Given both of those, I'd imagine the final solution would be `(x 16 * x * 235`.

When doing these calculations for those transactions, however, things are not lining up. Is my understanding of those values correct?
undefined says You can use this to get the gas needed and price directly: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-peripherals/rpc-utils/nodeinterface#estimateretryableticketaddress-sender-uint256-deposit-address-destaddr-uint256-l2callvalue-uint256-maxsubmissioncost-address-excessfeerefundaddress-address-callvaluerefundaddress-uint256-maxgas-uint256-gaspricebid-bytes-data-→-uint256-uint256-external

undefined says And right now if someone were to challenge, it would set challengeState = 0x0 and then if the other party does nothing the challenge stands after 7 days of waiting? What is the proxy address? All I see is the beacon and implementation
undefined says This seems to be what I was looking for. It looks like that call is working for mainnet Arbitrum, but I am getting `execution reverted` for the Rinkeby Nitro deployment. Would you expect the Rinkeby Nitro RPC endpoint to work with this call?
undefined says You should use eth_estimateGas to call as it describes here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L15
undefined says When a challenge happens(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/challenge/ChallengeManager.sol#L113), if the asserter doesn’t have response, it will cause timeout: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/challenge/ChallengeManager.sol#L271
undefined says Yea it appears to work great with the mainnet RPC! With the same params (and account balances), the same exact call that works on mainnet does not work on Rinkeby. Is the NodeInterface different for Nitro?
undefined says The nodeinterface file I sent you is nitro version, and it is different because you should change to eth_estimateCall to call.
undefined says Ahh I am so sorry I misunderstood. I will do that now
undefined says this is for nitro- i'm interested in the current arbitrum implementation
undefined says 1. It looks like the `estimateRetryableTicket()` returns the `gasLimit` for only the execution of the tx sent from L1 -> L2. It does not include the submission cost or the cost of the `redeem()` tx. Is there a convenient way to get this cost of calling `redeem()`?
2. Are any refunds applied to `excessFeeRefundAddress` in the case of a manual redemption. For example, a manual redemption with `0` value (`gasLimit`, `gasFeePerGas` and `gasValue` are all `0`), is there any reason to specify an `excessFeeRefundAddress` or a `callValueRefundAddress`?
undefined says hello! i am trying to connect to arbiscan on my metamask wallet and it seems to not pull up, i am getting this error
undefined says ```ReferenceError: Web3Eth is not defined```
undefined says is anyone here able to connect any of their wallets to arbiscan.io ?
undefined says Hi, `redeem` is  used to redeem a ticket when the auto-redeem fails, you just need to use `eth_estimateGas` before calling this is ok. Btw, for submissionCost, it will be very easy for nitro version, you can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L262 , for classic version, you can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L37.
2. For those params, you can read https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#other-parameters
undefined says For the timeout, classic also has this function.
undefined says In our system we plan to call `redeem()`.  It also looks like `nodeInterface.getGasCostEstimation()` does not include the cost to call `reedeem()`. I might be missing something, but how would I get the cost of a `redeem()` call?
undefined says What is your mm version? How about upgrading it?
undefined says The submission cost makes sense, thank you!
undefined says The `redeem` is not payable function, you just need to pay gas fee is ok, you can also use our sdk to do this, and we have such an example may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/redeem-failed-retryable
undefined says > you just need to pay gas fee

do you know if there is convenient way to get the value of the gas fee for this tx?
undefined says I think just use eth_estimateGas is the best way.
undefined says Ahhh I am sorry I was miscommunicating. We have a constraint whereby we want to make this call so that we can charge the user the cost _when_ they send from L1 -> L2 and not when it is actually executed on L2. Because of this, we will not always be able to call `eth_estimateGas` because there might not be a ticket that we can call to estimate. 

`nodeInterface.getGasCostEstimation()` is very convenient because it lets us simulate _any_ ticket execution. Is there an equivalent function for the `redeem()`?
undefined says Ah, so you mean you need to know the cost when call `createRetryableTicket` on l1? Right, you need prepare 3 part fee, 1. Submission Cost which I ready sent the method to you. 2. The gas which used to execute the following l2 tx, you can get gas limit by using https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L15 (nitro way) and for gas price, you can call eth_gasPrice to l2’s rpc, and you’d better multiply 15% to make sure the gas price is enough(this is just gas bid, and it will refund to you when it exceeds the real gas price),3. The msg.value in your following l2 tx, this depends on your demand.
As what you said about `redeem`,  you mean this function(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L18 )? If so, you just need to pay the gas when you call this function, because others fee you have already paid on l1. And `redeem` only needed to be called when your auto-redeem is failed(Every time you create retryable on l1, we will auto-redeem once for you, this is why you need pay l2’s gas fee in advance)
undefined says Maybe you are confused about the `redeem`, you only need to call it when you auto-redeem failed.
undefined says > Ah, so you mean you need to know the cost when call createRetryableTicket on l1? Right, you need prepare 3 part fee, 1. Submission Cost which I ready sent the method to you. 2.

All of this makes perfect sense 👍 

> As what you said about redeem,  you mean this function(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L18 )? 

yes 

> if so, you just need to pay the gas when you call this function, because others fee you have already paid on l1. And redeem only needed to be called when your auto-redeem is failed(Every time you create retryable on l1, we will auto-redeem once for you, this is why you need pay l2’s gas fee in advance) 

> Maybe you are confused about the redeem, you only need to call it when you auto-redeem failed.

we are intentionally failing the auto-redeem and we have a worker set up to redeem the ticket once it gets created. I'd be happy to talk through that design if you want 🙂

Because of that, the fee is not paid on L1, so we are just trying to understand how to calculate the fee in advance, if possible, just like `nodeInterface.getGasCostEstimation()`
undefined says Ah, we don’t have such a function to do that, but it can be done by add the value you get from `nodeInterface.getGasCostEstimation` to the part that the `redeem` function’s logic gas usage, you can get the second value by make a experiment, for example you call the `redeem` for a tx, and then use this (tx’s gas usage).sub(`nodeInterface.getGasCostEstimation`’s value).
undefined says Ok I understand. Thank makes sense. Thank you for your help.
undefined says Np, also I think you can add the `eth_estimateGas` to your flow chain before call `redeem`? Don’t know if it is possible.
undefined says That will not be possible because we need to know the value when the user sends the tx, ~5 minutes before `redeem` is called
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/archive/refs/tags/v1.4.1.tar.gz
undefined says I use this version, the source code compiles and runs
undefined says So what rpc is your l1 node using? This might be a sync issue to your l1 node.
undefined says reinstalled and it worke,d thank you
undefined says Our own eth node is used,Do you mean there is something wrong with L1?
undefined says Not sure, just a possibility, you can have a check on this.
undefined says Heard there is a prover in nitro  run as WASM mode, is the prover a  validator node? or a normal node?
undefined says The proving process is used for fraud proof, so it will be executed by validator.
undefined says I checked and our eth node is behaving normally
undefined says checking
undefined says It seems to be normal after reboot. It takes about two hours to load the database after reboot, is this normal?
undefined says It’s normal
undefined says Also, it might be OOM because process was sent SIGTERM, you can check your system monitor or logs.
undefined says Good morning
Please I only have 1 out of 8 roles connected to my wallet for the guild, can I still be eligible for the remaining roles or it has expired
undefined says Yes, you can continue to get the remaining roles
undefined says #✅︱roles
undefined says Yes, you can.
undefined says Alright
Thanks
undefined says Hey, is there any rough estimate on how much cheaper Arbitrum Nitro will be compared to Arbitrum One?
are we talking <2x cheaper, 2-10x cheaper, or >10x cheaper?
undefined says I remember where I saw it, it should only be $0.003
undefined says But please refer to the information of the team.
undefined says It's pretty low anyway.😁
undefined says Ah, not so cheap, I believe what you seen is after a series upgrade including also ethereum’s upgrade.
undefined says any indication of a rough range of how much cheaper Nitro will be compared to Arbitrum One (in % terms)?
undefined says Please wait for more information to be updated recently.😄
undefined says Why I can't bridge ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum Nova on your Arbitrum Bridge now?
undefined says Because it’s not officially open to the public yet
undefined says When does it open to public?
undefined says Does anyone know anything about the transaction type "ArbOS Internal Transaction 106"? I see it in the AnyTrust explorer and someone mentioned to me it may also be in Nitro but I can't find any docs on it.
undefined says SOOOOOOOOOON
undefined says We've used non-standard EIP-2718 style Typed Transaction for certain message types in Nitro. You can find the types and numbers here:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/141b0fcdf0e4d8e9e5de3f0466533b86563f2d29/core/types/transaction.go#L48-L54
undefined says Thanks for pointing this code out! What is the purpose of the internal transaction type? Is there any documentation on it yet? I'd like Ganache to be able to support this transaction type but I believe it currently doesn't and I'm trying to gather as much info as I can on it!
undefined says We need that for forking Geth to be compatible with Arbitrum logic. See this:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/arbos/Geth.md#transaction-types
undefined says Open to users and DAC members announced at the same time?
undefined says As a gift for Arbitrum One’s first anniversary, we’ll be migrating it to Nitro on August 31st - a year after opening Arbitrum One in public beta!! 🥳🚀
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085189823266875/1005102113476587540
undefined says Airdrop hunters everywhere
undefined says Read what I asked
undefined says If it's a dev issue, please wait for the team to reply. Arbitrum has no tokens and no airdrops. I'm not an airdrop hunter
undefined says hii
undefined says Nice
undefined says does github.com/offchainlabs/nitro have code for the client as well that is in github.com/offchainlabs/abitrum?
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs I think there is a bug with arbiscan
undefined says See here. The hyperlinked number stops at 25 regardless how many transactions you have. You have to click on it to see the true number.
undefined says For the sake of comparison, here is OP's block explorer. There's shows the true transaction count as the hyperlinked number.
undefined says Hey could you please send me a DM
undefined says I tried ser
undefined says I haven't received your DM!
undefined says It says i'm unable to send you a DM you. I can delete if this wasn't the appropriate channel to post this.
undefined says You should be able to, not sure why you can't.
I just want to have the address you're trying in Arbscan. If you're comfortable to send it here, please share it
undefined says I checked some wallets randomly and seems like they were ok!
undefined says Pickle Finance (PICKLE)
undefined says Yes, you can see go-ethereum, arbos and other related code there’s
undefined says I have same issue here
undefined says If possible, please dm me your address.
undefined says I've texted you. Check dm
undefined says Hi! I'm working on a cross chain DEX, and the client has an integrated ethereum light client using go-ethereum's Light ethereum package. I'm interesting in adding support for arbitrum, and I've looked through the code a little, but it seems like the Arbitrum node requires a full geth node to function, and only communicates through the RPCs. Is this true, or have I missed something? If it's not yet supported, is this something that anyone is working on?
undefined says Yeah, we only provide fullnode installation.
undefined says Ah.. is this due to some technical requirement, or has just no one done it yet?
undefined says No one done it yet.
undefined says cool thanks
undefined says I just replied you with another ss . Check dm when you see this message.. thanks
undefined says Any idea on how much downtime Arbitrum based projects will be experiencing during the migration?
undefined says Based on some previous migrations, it should take a few hours. But please wait for more information to be updated. #📢︱announcements
undefined says I’m just wondering if there is an idiots guide to running an Arbitrum nitro node, for this idiot? Thanks
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_nitro_node
undefined says Sir Hunter, i seen the announcement from FTX and Reddit. Wen public NOVA?
undefined says This should help you: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085189823266875/1005102113476587540
undefined says But that's for Nitro. Nvm now they posted a new thing!
undefined says Thanks very much 👍
undefined says on the nova website (<https://nova.arbitrum.io/>) under the 'Optimized for Scale' section, it says gas fees on Arbitrum Nova are "~0.5x" and gas fees on Ethereum are "~10x"
is this relative to Arbitrum One ("1x"), meaning that Arbitrum Nova is approximately 50% cheaper than Arbitrum One?
undefined says Can someone explain this Consensys and Nova partnership? Data Availability Community?
https://blog.infura.io/post/consensys-infrastructure-product-infura-joins-the-data-availability-committee-for-arbitrum-nova-offchain-labs-new-network
undefined says You may need this docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/anytrust , dac is the group that used to store the da for anytrust chain, and nova is the chain that based on anytrust technology.
undefined says Thanks for that
undefined says Is there any documentation or direction somebody can point me to in regards to bridging contracts/tokens between ONE and NOVA? And also between ETH and NOVA?
undefined says Thank you 💖
undefined says Not sure if something was fixed, but it's working good now 👍
undefined says Nova homepage, may be useful to you.
https://nova.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Our official bridge has not supported this yet.
undefined says Perfect! Happy to hear that!
undefined says 
undefined says been restarting my node about 12-14 hours ago still stuck here, it's normal to take this long?
undefined says (it's a strong machine 64gb ram)
undefined says 
undefined says i guess it's still doing things just very slow
undefined says What is your ssd? Nvme or normal ssd?
undefined says if you say it like that probably a normal one
undefined says which settings do you recommend on AWS ?
undefined says What is your node’s version?
undefined says latest docker image
undefined says ```offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.0-f4bbe91```
undefined says If you use a normal disk, it might take super long time to start your node, if you use Nvme pcie4, it only takes 20 minutes, it depends on your disk.
undefined says yea most likely, i will upgrade my disk thanks for help!
undefined says During Nitro migration downtime, could we still query the chain for historical/old data? Or are all Arbitrum nodes going to be plain unresponsive?
undefined says latest is `v1.4.1-h9180527`
undefined says we recommend to use the local nvme storage of the instance instead of ebs
undefined says updated thanks
undefined says thanks i already setup a new instance with exactly that, still gonna wait for the old one to compare and see the differences
undefined says quick question: I submitted my request for Arbitrum Nova access to whitelist two addresses (it's for my Hardhat plugin that uses a `CREATE2` factory: https://github.com/pcaversaccio/xdeployer). The reason why I'm asking is that already two people have asked me about supporting Arbitrum Nova.
undefined says Sorry, I don’t get what you mean, you mean whitelist to deploy contracts on nova? Nova is now open to everyone, you don’t need to be in whitelist now.
undefined says ah great, so I assume I misunderstood the announcement. How can I bridge funds from Arbitrum Nitro to Nova for the deployment? Simply via the usual bridge interface?
undefined says From arbitrum one to nova? You now still use bridge to transfer back to l1 and use our bridge to transfer to nova, but we will support 3rd part bridge to make this soon.
undefined says I see, thanks a lot for the information! quickly DMed you with a question.
undefined says I am trying to get the status of the L2 transaction when transfer funds from L1 to L2, it seems like I can use `L1ContractCallTransactionReceipt.waitForL2()`, but it seems like I can not access to this function directly, so how to make it?

My wrong way:
```
const depositRec = new L1TransactionReceipt(
  '0xa3285ccfbf05fe3193b0a5725b01638391b38147fc83c68ded4232e0b8ad2b52'
)

const l2Provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  'https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc'
)

const l2Result = await depositRec.waitForL2(l2Provider)
```
undefined says We have a tutorial about this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/greeter/scripts/exec.js#L159-L181
undefined says I just have transaction hash, so I can not use `const setGreetingRec = await setGreetingTx.wait()` My way is:
```
const tx = await l1Provider.getTransaction(
    '0xa3285ccfbf05fe3193b0a5725b01638391b38147fc83c68ded4232e0b8ad2b52'
  )

  const depositRec = new L1TransactionReceipt(tx)

  const message = await depositRec.getL1ToL2Message(l2Wallet)
```

But got an error: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'filter' of undefined`, so is there a way use transaction hash to get status on the L2 tx.
undefined says I think this is what you're looking for:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/a0139d99bec0f2805ddfd28199a038e5a631c749/packages/redeem-failed-retryable/scripts/exec-redeem.js#L32
undefined says Okay, let me have a check
undefined says What determines if multiple transactions are added to the same Arbitrum block? It seems that the vast majority of arbitrum blocks contain only 1 transaction, but some contain far more than 1 (presumably when people are racing to get an arbitrage opportunity). Is it just based on some timing threshold, i.e. all transactions arriving at the sequencer node within a 1 second window will be added to the same block, or is it dependent on the number of transactions in the queue etc? Are there any docs explaining the workings of this process?
undefined says moving funds from ethereum mainnet to nova takes 1 week ? am i correct ?
undefined says Arbitrum.’s sequencer block doesn’t have a fixed block time, it depends on the network, when there is a tx, there will be a block produce. If network is congestion, one block may contain more than one tx.
undefined says From ethereum to nova will arrive around 5-10 minutes. But move funds from nova to l1 using official bridge will cost 7 days.
undefined says how many cold storage accesses can fit in a block? (for example, cold SLOADs, which cost `2100 gas` in regular EVM)
if it's not known, could at least get some low precision estimate? it's fine if min and max are off by orders of magnitude
undefined says Is there any documentation on exactly how this works? Or if not, do you know where this lives in the codebase? Thank you
undefined says I notice that the timestamp is not updated in each block. Is this expected? Can someone explain? Thank you.
undefined says has anything changed in the past week that breaks nodes and requires some updates?
undefined says What are the steps to revoke a contract on Nova explorer?
undefined says hey guys
undefined says Are there any popular NFT repo for arbitrum
undefined says wow
undefined says Hey Fam 

If you are currently building on Arbitrum and need a product designer(UI&UX Designer).
I have worked on some web3 products on Arbitrum ranging from DEX to web3 multi chain Mobile wallet,A social fi website, NFT marketplace platform and also many more.
You can dm me for my portfolio 

You can please reach out to me so we can build something usable on the Arbitrum ecosystem.
undefined says Nova need token 🚨🚨🚨
undefined says Its be safest for use ,because a lot of user  can't believe, centralized organizations like ftx, google
undefined says arbitrum no token
undefined says I know man , I said nova need token
undefined says If you are dev ,you’ll understand whats my means (no airdrop or dao )
undefined says Currently no information on `nova tokens`
undefined says Beware of various scams. For more information, please follow the #📢︱announcements
undefined says Anyone also experiencing node with very high cpu usage? Also failing to keep up to sync very often since yesterday.
undefined says Running on a 32 cores 8255C + nvme, dont think its a hardware problem
undefined says Ok. I know ,there is no token ,i just check how nova work and find this….
undefined says Yes, https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Time_in_Arbitrum
undefined says What is your ram?
undefined says You can find nft projects there: https://portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says For classic, the latest version is v1.4.1 which released on 03/June (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/releases), and for nitro, the latest is v2.0.0-beta9 which released 9 days ago (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases)
undefined says We have the opcode here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/AVM_Specification, and the gas limit per second for arbitrum is 120k, when upgrade to nitro, we will have those opcodes same as ethereum, and the gas limit per second will be much higher.
undefined says I see. Is there any way that I can get the timestamp when the sequencer picks up the tx?
undefined says We will have the timestamp sync to sequencer’s local time after nitro upgrade.
undefined says For now, it is hard to get the real timestamp.
undefined says Thanks. Good to know.
undefined says 64GB
undefined says hey guys, I read that Arbitrum is a multi-round interactive rollup
undefined says Is there an example re-execution approach?
undefined says Like is there any L2 that actually uses the re-execution approach?
undefined says We have a test here may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/test/challenge.spec.ts
undefined says After we upgrade to nitro, the node requirement will be much lower, currently it does will take much resources to do it.
undefined says I'm really looking forward to the upgrade. Just wondering if the actual upgrade will be seamless for the current node operators, or does the node need to be resynced? I heard resync with nitro takes much lesser time compared to the current client?
undefined says Question for bridging devs (and Briding UX):

Most bridges I used only need to have (1 approve ofc. and) 1 sign for funds to go from L1 to L2 or other chains. Does a bridge need to have 1 sign and 1 claim tx if its not an EVM or not a L1-L2 bridge? i.e. a new L1 (non-EVM) and ETH mainnet? or can you make it so that you only need 1 sign and it auto claims on the destined chain?
undefined says i've been stuck on
```
Last  valid database checkpoint,  total gas used: 83347052058913, L1 block: 15295389, L2 block: 19628575, log count: 41813981, messages count: 40866528, timestamp: Sun Aug  7 13:22:06 2022
```
for a few days now with node restarting every few hours
undefined says any suggestions?
undefined says Any error message? Are you on the latest node version offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.1-h9180527 ?
undefined says no and yes which is why there is nothing to go off of for debugging
undefined says also tried increasing log levels by setting --log.core and --log.rpc to trace
undefined says but didn't get any additional logs from that
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/1005200420865585333
undefined says Proper amount of RAM? Do you have a swap file? Just going through the usual suspects 🥸
undefined says had been running node on the same server for past 3 months though
undefined says 32gb ram / 8gb swap
undefined says Can I config the db_check_point path when starting a arb node?
undefined says Odd for sure. Most of these issues should be fixed in a couple weeks with the release of nitro. I know that doesn't help you now though.
undefined says Not saying this is the issue but I usually give a few gigs over my ram size for swap. I have seen nodes take up over 20 gigs before with only 32
undefined says actually think maybe its OOM
undefined says the initial state loading is memory intensive?
undefined says hardware intensive in general
undefined says i have recently put another node on this machine, maybe thats why arbitrum node went OOM
undefined says okay pushed the swap to 40G, lets see 🤞
undefined says does docker use swap though?
undefined says docker stats shows mem limit as 32G
undefined says I am also stuck like this with 31G swap
undefined says It normally proceeds after awhile
undefined says So I want to give up the docker one and switch to local build one
undefined says Poorly I failed to configure the db path when starting arb node
undefined says I truly don’t want start from block 0 again
undefined says wdym? is your data not persisting?
undefined says I just want to switch to local build version
undefined says But..
undefined says All the db file sync with docker
undefined says How can I configure the db path when starting a arb node of local build version?
undefined says I mean just change the default path of “~/.arbitrum/mainnet “ to my custom path
undefined says It's not about the bridge, it's about the token contract logic which needs approval before transferFrom logic. Some tokens have Permit functionality to avoid 2 tx (1 for approval 1 for transfer) but it depends on the token logic if implement it or not.
undefined says I’ve got it “persistent.global-config”
undefined says seems to be so. lmk how it goes.
undefined says It is seamless for users, but for node operator, you still need to upgrade your node and use our new snapshot to re-sync.
undefined says got it running, thanks
undefined says im not talking about the approve/sign, I understand that mechanism and its for protection so ppl do not approve+sent in 1 tx (like with Rune and its shenanigans). Im specifically asking if it is necessary to have 2 seperate transactions (1 Sent to Smart Contract on ETH to lock-up/burn tokens) and 1 Claim from a smart contract on a NON-EVM Layer 1. Is it possible to have it do in 1 tx (only the sent). Or is it necessary to have a claim function to due to reasons x,y ,z.
undefined says or do you mean that if the token on the other side (for claim and is non-evm L1) has a permit function it can avoid the claim tx?
undefined says Hi, if your bridge is a normal liquidity bridge, of course you can only let user send only one tx, and the bridge relayer send another tx for the users (relayer will collect the other tx’s gas fee first).
undefined says and what if you are not a normal liquidity bridge, but a main canonical one where the 1 token that is sent is ERC20 and the other token is a different standard?
undefined says You mean burn-mint bridge? I think it’s ok for only one tx. Logic is typically collecting user’s second tx gas fee first is ok.
undefined says I see, yeh i mean a burn-mint bridge. So the action to claim on the non-EVM L1 problem is the gas fee that needs to be present to sent it?
undefined says is it possible you think for a bridge operator to increase i.e. the gas fee on ETH, and then supply the gas on the other chain so that it is done in 1 tx? or will this be very hard you think
undefined says Increase the gas fee on eth will just only go directly to the ethereum miner, however, you should make your function is payable and let the user pay some ethers which will be used to pay the gas on the target chain, or you can just lock the user’s token but mint less token on the target chain (The difference here is used to pay the gas fee).
undefined says I see, and this is all do-able in 1 transaction you think? Even when its from EVM --> non-EVM?
undefined says Yup, you can see the examples of wbtc, I think that is what you want.
undefined says thanks a lot
undefined says Hey guys
undefined says I was trying to interact with some methods of contracts through arbiscan and I keep getting Typeerror
undefined says I can't really figure out the source of the error. I've tried querying using my address in bytecode but nothing
undefined says Can you press f12 and see what errors prompts?
undefined says Cannot read properties of undefined (reading "methods")
undefined says seems to be a javascript error
undefined says Ah, can you share with me the page and what function you call?
undefined says Just tried some contract, it seems work fine on my side.
undefined says was there a change in the rpc functionality for arbitrum recently? A program of mine is using the rpc function *eth_getBlockByHash* and it now always returns null as result...   (on alchemy endpoint with wss as well as a post against https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc)
undefined says Did you use a wrong block hash? It works on my side.
undefined says I don't think so. It is a program that uses eth_newBlockFilter and feeds the results into getBlockByHash...
undefined says ok the rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc endpoint works after all
undefined says gotta recheck the alchemy endpoint
undefined says ok works - something gotta be wrong on my end
undefined says but it still is weird - it is a web3j application and when I use rinkeby endpoints (L1) it works -  it used to work on arbitrum rinkeby too
undefined says ok maybe it's an alchemy problem but the same thing works on the L1 rinkeby wss endpoint
undefined says when I do this flow with normal http calls (non wss) against https://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/rpc then it works too though 🤷‍♂️

edit: it also works on arbitrum goerli through alchemy, so whatever... gotta make the switch anyways
undefined says Is there an API call that can be used to get the gas price paid for a past transaction (or even a breakdown of L1 and L2 gas amounts and gas costs, as they have on Arbiscan)? If not, is there a way to receive that information having just made a transaction request, i.e. somewhere in the transaction response?
undefined says Yeah just get the transaction receipts using RPC and then check the feeStats field. It'll give you the information.
Note that this is for Arbitrum One (on mainnet). If you're testing on Nitro: after Nitro feeStats field will be depreciated and instead you can use gasUsed (total) and gasUsedForL1 fields
undefined says .
undefined says .
undefined says Can we always withdraw our funds back to L1 if something bad happens to the L2 chain specifically Optimistic Rollups?
undefined says An article to read with regards to this would be appreciated.
undefined says Not for now. It's not permissionless to post rollup blocks to the L1. In the future it will change.
undefined says Where can I download the most recent snapshot for the node DB?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Running_Nitro_Node
undefined says To complete my answer,  users always can send withdraw transactions using delayed inbox, even if sequencer get shutdown or tries to censor a transaction. 
For validator side as I said right now they’re whitelisted but it’s on the roadmap to remove the whitelisting and make it permissionless.
undefined says So in simple terms, can we withdraw it or not? From the first reply you said "not for now". Thanks!
undefined says Cool, that works, thank you
undefined says alchemy‘s arb-rinkeby rpc is under maintenance.
undefined says This is only for Nitro. The page for running an Arbitrum One node doesn't have snapshot links
undefined says Its the same insutruction for Nova, you should only use the right chain id (Nova : 42170)
undefined says I'm asking about mainnet, with chain id 42161
undefined says Oh another Discord message says it is https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
undefined says This snapshot can be used to help sync. We currently don’t have the latest snapshot, but on 31/Aug, we will release a latest snapshot during nitro upgrade.
undefined says Anyone working on private smart contracts?
undefined says Need to hide payload data in a contract execution, is there an anytrust expert that can msg me?
undefined says I'm on Australia time so happy to leave msg overnight
undefined says what is the difference of this with the nodes i run with go eth ?
undefined says been wondering about this for 2 days
undefined says You mean the difference between arb node and geth?
undefined says yes
undefined says since geth can do a private network too
undefined says It’s kinda different between those two, because we need add fraud proof mechanics and sequencer . For our classic node, you can read our architecture here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Inside_Arbitrum#arbitrum-architecture
undefined says Oh, arbitrum is not a private network, it’s a layer2 network running on ethereum.
undefined says so geth is just a nodes and cant be a L2, and arbistrum is L2 without using geth?
undefined says Geth is designed for l1, it lacks some architecture which is needed for l2. We will have a upgrade soon which will let our node contains geth part and some others parts which used for layer2 mechanics.
undefined says which means, geth can be a L2 if you add / modify *architecture* to it ?
undefined says Yes
undefined says This is how we made it if you are interested: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro
undefined says woah, this is what i looking for, so nitro itself is using geth on L2,

so AVM will be migrated to nitro soon ?
undefined says We will not use AVM after nitro, here is the sandwich architecture with geth: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/inside-arbitrum-nitro/geth-sandwich.png
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/inside-arbitrum-nitro/inside_arbitrum_nitro.md#geth-at-the-core
undefined says to make sure one more thing, nitro is a network chain right?
undefined says not just a simple node
undefined says Nope, nitro is a tech stack, and will be used in arbitrum one 2 weeks later.
undefined says hmm, so the network is arbitrum one, using nitro as a tech stack?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum <- this is arbitrum one right?
undefined says This is our classic architecture
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085189823266875/1005102113476587540
undefined says One is a network name, while nitro is a tech stack name.
undefined says well if you dont have One as a network name, default name will be nitro right?
undefined says Hmm, nitro now is also used by arb-rinkeby and arb-goerli, it is not only used by arbitrum one, so it’s not a good idea to default name it as nitro.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Public_Chains
undefined says i know, i think i get the point, aribtrum one, arb-rinkeby, arb-goerli is just a name, while.. all of its use nitro as their tech stack
undefined says Yup
undefined says thanks for the explanation, looking forward for the next 2weeks!
undefined says I was trying the abracadabra contract
undefined says can you share the one that worked? I want to see if it's a problem on my side
undefined says do you mean on their UI?
undefined says no I was interacting with the contract through arbiscan
undefined says I get this error
undefined says Which method are you trying to call? Just tried some on my end, it works fine.
undefined says using the web3 py package it works however the front end of arbiscan doesn't
undefined says might be a js error
undefined says can anyone point me to the evm implementation code of arbitrum one?
undefined says For classic: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-avm-cpp , for nitro, we use geth core to execute.
undefined says Does Tight Variable Packing make sense in the AVM or is it not worth it?
Basically, does it practically save any gas or storage cost are too small too care?
undefined says It still needed.
undefined says And we will soon upgrade to nitro, at that time, we don’t use AVM but geth core to execute.
undefined says Ok, interesting.
undefined says Does that change your answer? I mean, would you say variable packing still makes sense in Nitro?
undefined says Still make sense, just want to mention AVM will no more alive after nitro.
undefined says ok
undefined says does that mean that gas will be prices as in mainnet?
undefined says L1
undefined says Yes, the opcode cost will be same as l1, but we still charge l1 fixed cost and l1 calldata cost.

undefined says Hey guys, if the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, can I still send transactions and update the Arbitrum state without any sequencer running ?
undefined says Yes! You can directly send tx to our inbox yourself if the sequencer is down.
undefined says Hey folks, what are the hardware requirements to run a full node for Arbitrum One?
undefined says Okay cool and it will update the Arbitrum state automatically ? Because on Optimism I can send a tx to the CanonicalChain contract but it won't be updated until the sequencer update it itself (the point is that he HAVE to include it, but you still need a sequencer running to update the state, is it same for Arbitrum ?)
undefined says Hey! Take a look here: https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413938850075-What-s-the-hardware-requirements-to-run-the-full-node-
undefined says Yes it will. Lets say you put your tx  in the delayed Inbox and sequencer is down (so it can’t  include your tx  in a batch). Instead, you can use SequencerInbox’s forceInclusion method. Once a message has been in the delayed Inbox for a sufficient amount of time forceInclusion can be called to move it from the delayed Inbox into the core Inbox, at which point it’s finalized. Crucially, any address can call forceInclusion.
undefined says We provide a detailed explanation about this in our docs:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Censorship_resistance
undefined says Nice thank you very much, I'm going through all the docs right now, I'll arrive there at some point ! THank you for the confirmation 👌
undefined says Happy to help! 🙂
undefined says Is the Nitro upgrade on Aug 31?
undefined says Yes!
undefined says Is it currently possible to experiment with submitting fraud proofs and/or new chain updates on testnet?
Are there some resources on how to do this?
(yes, I am willing to lose some goerli/rinkeby ETH 🙂 )
undefined says Only validator can start challenge, but validator has whitelist now.
undefined says I see. Where can I read up on how to become a validator? And how to operate one?
undefined says ah, we haven’t opened public registration yet.
undefined says Just to be clear, I mean testnets, not mainnet. I this is also restricted for now?
If this isn't public either, is this something I can test locally on a devnet?
undefined says We have a related challenge test file here, you can read it and see how it works: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/system_tests/full_challenge_impl_test.go
undefined says Thanks. will look into it 🙂 
Any idea when becoming a validator becomes publicly available? On testnet at least?
undefined says Sorry, we don’t have a timeline for this yet.
undefined says anyone having issues verifying contracts on arbitrum-one?
undefined says rinkeby seems to work but not mainnet
undefined says any issues happening right now?
undefined says No issue reported. Please ask Etherscan team's support
undefined says 
undefined says Will the gas table for op codes change with the Nitro upgrade?
undefined says Will be same as evm
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#cool-new-stuff
undefined says Oh sweet thanks I was looking for something exactly like that doc
undefined says Sup
undefined says Hey, am i correct that arbitrum has unlimited contract bytcode size, unlike the 24 KB  limit of eip-170 on ethereum mainnet? Thanks
undefined says no, we have the same limit in nitro
undefined says and testnet has all the same limits?
undefined says Hey guys, is it possible to update de Arbitrum One L2 chain if there is no active validators ?
undefined says Yes
undefined says No
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs dm
undefined says when will the second week resume
undefined says After Nitro upgraded in August 31st.
undefined says Please only send messages on 1 channel.
undefined says I am sorry for that 🥵
undefined says Haha, it’s ok.
undefined says 🌄 hey peeps, trying to do a deep dive into arbitrum 

i wonder if there's any extended documentation of code merkleization? seems like a somewhat complex process and it has only a couple of paragraphs in the docs. if there are no docs, could someone point me to relevant source files?e
undefined says merklezation, you mean the state tree or account tree?
undefined says Or our l2->l1 messages’ tree?
undefined says I mean the state of the virtual machine to be used in dispute-solving: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Inside_Arbitrum#supporting-merkleization
undefined says As I understand it, this is not only "state tree", because there needs to be a merkle tree of the _execution_ or at least of the _internal state of the virtual machine_, which is differente from the state tree/account tree on ETH
undefined says I'm not familiar with the L2->L1 messages tree yet 😦
undefined says You can find more info on:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/AVM_Design
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Dispute_Resolution
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/AVM_Specification
undefined says Note that this will change after Nitro. These are about the AVM stack.
undefined says Here you can find docs about Nitro:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/master/docs
undefined says Godsend, thank you!
undefined says We'll publish more info about Nitro soon
undefined says Np!
undefined says The arbitrum mono repo `master` is not nitro right? That's all in the `nitro` repository?
undefined says For protocol level yeah all is in Nitro repo.
undefined says If you're reading the inside Arbitrum doc, it's good. However some parts will change after Nitro, it'll give you the overvirew what's going on the Arbitrum.
undefined says We'll change the Inside Arbitrum docs soon to explain just Nitro stack btw
undefined says Is there a repository where I can download the current arbitrum docs? Prefer to focus on one protocol.
undefined says I can do the mental "diff" later ha.
undefined says You mean the classic or Nitro?
undefined says Classic, because if as you said the docs change to "just nitro" i will loose current track of studying 🙂
undefined says Here it is:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/f06605a39fdfaea4312743ae1b2d7cb110c8dd87/docs
undefined says ah gr8, all in the repository, awesome
undefined says ok, thanks for pointers!
undefined says i think i've got enough
undefined says Np! LFG!
undefined says I've got some more protocol questions 🙂 

* As I understand, currently there is no way to be a validator and to advance the L2 chain for myself. In the future, will this process be incentivized? if so, will there need to be some consensus on who proposes each block? Can there be validators frontrunning each other to put stake on L1?

* And related to that, the docs mention the *preferred aggregator* which is the ArbitrumOne sequencer. And that accounts need to chose there aggregator. How are aggregators and validators related? Will there be >1 aggregator in the future? Does it need to be set per tx?
undefined says Jumping on your questions amanusk, because I still got some and maybe the same person can answer us both.

I read the resources shared yesterday. While great, they do not go very deep into the actual process of preparing a proof. The closes is the `ChallengeManager` doc here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/proving/challenge-manager.md. 

But I'm still not finding what I want, which is some specification on the machine that runs the challenges. Most possibly this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/21ce4812a7d202e41c165b8ec1c9154801325e1c/contracts/src/state


Related: what is the role of the off-chain `prover`? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/21ce4812a7d202e41c165b8ec1c9154801325e1c/arbitrator/prover. I assume it is used by validators to agree on a minimum bisections of what they disagree on which will be then solved in the `Machine.sol` contract as an arbiter.
undefined says no consensus is required because L2 Node is deterministic given what is on L1 inbox + the previous confirmed node (which included previous state hash and a machine hash among other things)
undefined says we no longer support aggregator, so the only aggregator you can use would be the sequencer we run right now, in the future it will be decentralized
undefined says the machine is geth compiled to wasm which our onchain prover can understand
undefined says validator also run the wasm code offchain to make sure it match the output of the golang compiled geth to be safe
undefined says non-validator on the other hand run native go code for maximal performance
undefined says How long does it take a sync an Arbitrum One node? I've been running one for the past week and it's only on April 2022. I'm running a dedicated machine with 64GB RAM and an NVMe drive. Any tips to make it sync faster?
undefined says Nvme pcie4？
undefined says We will upgrade to nitro next week, and at that time, we will provide a latest snapshot.( Because we will change the database after upgrade) So I recommend you use that snapshot we will release next week.
undefined says I'll have to double-check that it's using 4 lanes and not 2. Good to know that there'll be a snapshot!
undefined says How much disk space is a full archive node taking up these days? And growth rate? Trying to spec how much storage I'll be needing over the next year or so.
undefined says Since we will upgrade to nitro next week, and nitro has different data structure on database, so I can’t give you a precise number(yes, we will change our database when upgrade to nitro). But since we will use geth core in nitro version, You can refer to the current and future hard disk overhead required to run Ethereum geth to estimate.
undefined says Appreciate the low-down. Seems I should wait until Nitro lands and the backfill download is available.
Rather than specific, more looking for a magnitude scale so that I don't under-provision myself. 100GB, 1TB, 10TB?
undefined says Currently for our classic version, 600gb will be safe to run an archive node, but since we are going to be running on nitro version in the future, and if you want to keep running for a long time, it’s better to choose a much larger than this, maybe 1t-2t.
undefined says ack. Super helpful. Thanks!
undefined says I've some questions.
1. In this site(https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Running_Node), what kind is this node? I got confused because I heard that I cannot run node for aggregator and validator.
2. I wonder relationales why i should wait 7 days for withdraw. If it is faster than 7 days, is it can be matter?
3. Could you tell me flow about transaction created in L2? Can this tx be rollback by challenge?
4. If aggregator node which operated by Offchain Labs is shutdown, i cannot create tx in L2? Can i create transactions for withdraw at delayed inbox in L1 only?
5. Have there been any challenges in longer time? like after 24 hours.
undefined says guys is there already any web3 library to connect wallets into arbitrum?
undefined says 1. It’s a normal full node, users can not run validators or aggregator node for now.
2. This is because fraud proof windows, and 7 days is the  agreement with ethereum community.
3. Transaction won’t rollback once it goes to l1, you can read this article: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Finality
4. Yes, you can use our delayed inbox and force it to conclude to l2’s state.
5. There isn’t a challenge in our network now, because currently no validators cheat.
undefined says All web3 libraries which support ethereum will also support arbitrum.
undefined says yes i know that, but i am wondering if there is already some library done  to use
undefined says to just copy paste :)
undefined says Ah, you mean web3js or ethersjs?
undefined says Thanks for answer!
undefined says you know the standard library to connect wallets
undefined says Here is the mm’s docs, you can see here: https://docs.metamask.io/guide/ethereum-provider.html
undefined says thanks
undefined says is there any other with coinbase and other wallets?
undefined says You can use wallectconnect: https://docs.walletconnect.com
undefined says thanks
undefined says So EIP 4399 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399) changes the difficulty opcode to the RANDAO op code which provides a psuedo source of randomness to elect new block producers in eth 2. 

I know its written here (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Inside_Arbitrum#more-evm-emulation-details) that the difficulty op code in arbitrum returns a constant value. Is it possible to actually relay the new RANDAO op code ? this value is updated every epoch (to elect the new block proposers) so its only updated every 6.4 minutes.

This would provide dapp developers a good source of psuedorandomness for reasonable applications (nft rarity, games) maybe it's even robust enough for some sortition / random selection mechanisms
undefined says That’s a good idea, but I think there still might be some sync problems, because l2 needs sometime to sync from l1 this value, what if during the sync time, users just see the value from l1, and make a cheat before this value update to l2.
undefined says Dapp developers can implement a block lookahead value. Committing to reading the RANDAO opcode 4 epochs in the future + arbitrum syncing upperbound. 

And interactions requiring the RANDAO psuedorandomness will not be atomic, but split across several epochs. So for example 

call requestRandomNFTStats
- records blocknumber
wait 4 epochs + L2 syncing lag

call receiveRandomNFTStats
- reverts if current blocknumber is not > request blocknumber + block look ahead
- reads current RANDAO value
undefined says This is a solution, but it may cause some more difficulties to developers and if some developers don’t know this feature just copy their code from l1 to deploy, also has some issues.
undefined says most L1 dapps use the blockhash for randomness. Few if any are currently using the difficulty op code.

The warning to developers about block lookaheads for the difficulty opcode is included in the EIP. In this case, this op code change doesn't break any backwards compatibility. 

>> developer doesn't read the documentation
not my problem. hahaha, just kidding : ) yeah its good to make these things dummy proof. That's one reason why the RANDAO opcode was not named the RANDOM opcode. So developers would not be confused that RANDAO is not a "truly" random value, but is deterministic in nature, just pseudorandom
undefined says /featureRequest :arbiblobblue: :arbitrum: 🙏
undefined says Yup, this is a good feature, will let my team know, thanks for your advise.🙏
undefined says Thanks. That's helpful.
I'd be happy to get a broader picture of which part will be decentralized and how the incentives would work.

Clearly there needs to be someone who decides on the L1 inbox, and also pay for the gas costs of populating the inbox. So what will the incentives be, and how is frontrunning avoided?

Similarly for validators, can multiple validators stake on the same block? how do they cover the gas costs of staking actions?
undefined says For inbox, anyone can put tx into it, but obviously it will cost a lot to call the l1’s contract, so we have sequencer managing this(user can choose send tx directly to inbox or send tx to sequencer), when users send tx to sequencer, the sequencer will collect those tx, and batch them into l1, which will also provide a fast confirmation for users(sequencer can decide the tx order), and our sequencer take tx as first come first serve(there is no txpool on arbitrum), also one thing worth mention is, in the future, we will have decentralized sequencer. And for validators, they can stake on the same rollup block. And validator now has whitelist, so we don’t have a full incentive methods on it, but for those who choose to cheat, we will slash them and use their funds to reward those honest validators.
undefined says Thanks for then replies!
So how will this works with multiple sequencers? Won't they be competing with each other on who puts the txs on L1? What if a sequencer puts a tx that has already been broadcast by someone else? Is it simply ignored?
If/when validators whitelist is removed, will it make sense for >1 validator to stake on a block?
On one hand, if there is an incentive to do so, then all should stake, but his will lead to many txs on L1.
On the other hand, if staking is limited to only one validator per block, there there is a race to who stakes on it first.

Is there another option?
undefined says For decentralized sequencer, we haven’t announced the details. And for validators, just as I said, they can stake at the same block: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol#L135
undefined says I couldn't find any information about light clients on Arbitrum, are they available? Or is there only the full node as described here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Running_Node
undefined says Arbitrum requires full nodes. Light nodes will not work.
undefined says I see, that was my guess as well.
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says Best
undefined says lfg
undefined says Hey guys! I'm looking to add a list of tokens available on Arbitrum to add them to dune (so they would be available for everyone to easily query).

1. Where could I find an extensive list containing the contract_address, symbol name and number of decimal places for each token? 

2. Also looking for a list for NFTs with the contract_address and the name of each collection would be amazing!

The more extensive those lists are, the better, thanks!
undefined says Here's a good start:
https://arbiscan.io/tokens
https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/arbitrum-ecosystem
https://arbiscan.io/tokens-nft
undefined says thanks I saw those websites but ideally a csv file with all of those available would be great none of those websites allow to pull that data (with contract address, token ticker and decimal places) through their api

and same for nfts with contract address and collection name
undefined says ah, did you check https://thegraph.com/hosted-service in the community section if any suit your needs?
undefined says can't find any that work for me unfortunately, you wouldn't have access to a list somewhere?
undefined says I'll see what I can find when I get back to my PC 👍
undefined says ty ser!
undefined says Does arbitrum support deployment of contracts developed using EIP-2535?
undefined says https://nomics.com/chains/arbitrum/tokens
undefined says allows you to d/l csv
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/apis#tokens
undefined says also the api from arbiscan idk if that helps I assume you checked there earlier
undefined says yes both of those dont have contract address + number of decimal places 😦
undefined says You can use this to gen: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-lists
undefined says 🤦‍♂️ I knew I did this before...
undefined says it was really bothering me lol
undefined says :arbitrum: 🚀🚀🚀🚀
undefined says 👋 is it possible to know how many validators are there currently?

I'm guessing this is the variable but unfortunately it's not public and asking here it's probably easier than messing with storage calls 🙂
```    
mapping(address => bool) isValidator;
```
undefined says 2?
undefined says just a guess from staked on last-node + addresses that seem to interact with contract 🙂
undefined says users can not run validators or aggregator node for now
undefined says i know, just wanted to know how many whitelisted there are
undefined says I don't know the specifics, and I don't have much information to update
https://medium.com/offchainlabs/fraud-proofs-and-validators-how-you-or-anyone-can-keep-arbitrum-honest-d68add3f6c5d
undefined says @mjohannsson seems to have asked the same a while ago and also got no answer
undefined says For the last while there have only two addresses interacting that's why I ventured two, but I might be wrong
undefined says anyway I can wait for someone with more info to answer 🙂
undefined says thanks @SingLin (will NEVER dm you) !
undefined says You're welcome, please wait for other members to answer your questions
undefined says You can track this function’s call: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupAdminLogic.sol#L158
undefined says ty! seeing "chainId": 1 in this file here, doesn't that mean ethereum mainnet?
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-lists/blob/master/src/SourceLists/whitelist_era_src.json

Are all arbitrum token addresses the same as the ones seen on mainnet? because I checked and some token addresses live on mainnet aren't used on arbitrum, will they be the same on arbitrum if they start being bridged?
undefined says Bumping this. Is EIP-2535 supported?
undefined says Hey,
Yeah you can deploy all contracts that is deployable on Eth mainnet, to Arbitrum,
undefined says what is the L1 gas cost for exiting via Arbitrum bridge, when bridging ETH. Which contract should I look at to see some exit transactions?
undefined says Afaik those gas costs are related to the eth mainnet.
undefined says https://etherscan.io/gastracker
undefined says I'm more interested in the amount of gas required, not the L1 gas price, TBH
undefined says The amount of gas required to claim the withdrawal on mainnet?
undefined says yes. I'm trying to research how it all works
undefined says If yes you can see our outbox contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x760723CD2e632826c38Fef8CD438A4CC7E7E1A40
track the calls into `Execute Transaction ` function of the contract to see how much gas needed for the call.
Note that it really depends on the transaction, because the user may set destination to a smart contract and the withdraw tx may consume more gas than regular.
undefined says test
undefined says is there new docker image for nitro? or do i have to build from the dockerfile? currently have a node running via docker
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/1012520538645741568
undefined says I want to run arbi nitro node after 31 august.  If I run node on my own server and how can I connect my wallet to node on my own server? Do I need to change rpc etc.?  how can i do this
undefined says Hm
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/running_node
undefined says we have a development question. how the gas price and gas limits are calculated on Arbitrum
We have a smart contracts where we need to calculate/hardcode/estimate the gas used for certain transaction types beforehand, like for example you can estimate on L1 that a known swap transaction costs around 150 000 gas units.

However, we have had simulation where the VERY same transaction was mined with 
-  50 000 gas limit & 7 gwei gas price paid
-  800 000 gas limit & 0.7 gwei gas price paid
The end transaction fee was still the same, but the gas limit* gas price numbers were very different in both cases
undefined says So far, we were assuming that our transactiion execution cost was around 800 000 gas units, but seems something is different.
undefined says Hmm, not, the a#contract address depends on user’s address and nonce of that address，so not all address is the same as ethereum.
undefined says If you run your own node, your node will have some specific port you can connect: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Running_Nitro_Node#important-ports , you can just connect to 8547 if you don’t manually set it.
undefined says For the gas calculation results difference, you will find answers here: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says thanks, this is tricky, does estimate gas price RPC returns only the L2 estimated gas or both;; 
i.e how to calculate the overral estimated gas price BEFORE a transaction is submited
undefined says Both, and it is real time value, so that’s why we recommend every time you send tx on l2 use eth_estimate rather than hardcode gas.
undefined says You can just use that value as your gaslimit to send tx.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Hey, have a great weekend  😄
undefined says Haha, you too.
undefined says ok thanks this is the confirmation I needed; that it is safe to use estimateGas as gasLimit
undefined says does Nitro update has any effect on this calculation logic ?
undefined says Hey, I'm trying to send a high number of transactions to a smart contract, some of those might fail.
As far as I understand, I need to wait for the tx to get accepted or rejected by arbitrum to send the next tx with the correct nonce. But this causes a rather poor throughput. Does anyone know how to speed this up and still use one address?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Call a contract function which calls all the functions in each of those txns. That will bundle them all into one giga txn
undefined says HAODE
undefined says Wonderful protocol
undefined says yup
undefined says Great
undefined says Is there a specific block number or time (in UTC) when nitro goes live?
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks
undefined says What's the difference between stakers and validators? 😕
undefined says I understand one may be a validator and may _not_ stake for some reason during some period of time, but a _staker_ is a validor who is active on some branch, right?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum#arbitrum-rollup-protocol
"The parties who participate in the protocol are called validators. Anyone can be a validator. Some validators will choose to be stakers--they will place an ETH deposit which they’ll be able to recover if they’re not caught cheating. These roles are permissionless: anyone can be a validator or a staker."
undefined says just to confirm, everything deployed pre migration will work exaclty the same on nitro correct?
undefined says are there working steps for compiling a nitro node from source?
undefined says so far cloned nitro git repository, did git submodule update --init --recursive, installed rust, installed cbindgen... when i run "make" it does build a lot of stuff but gets stuck at "yarn --cwd contracts build", oddly getting an error about ./scripts/build.bash not found even though there's a file named that in contracts/ directory...
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp-migration.md#dapps
undefined says You need to see this docs: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp-migration.md#dapps
undefined says thanks for reply. not sure the answer is on that page. i'm looking for something equivalent to the "native setup instructions" from this page: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Installation
undefined says i'm trying to build the node from the git repository without using a docker image
undefined says We don’t have such a docs guided how to run arbitrum locally, but this might help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash (this is also docker way)
undefined says Not clear what's the purpose of the distinction -- if validator has no stake, what's the incentive not to cheat and thus slow down the network?

Those docs seems misleading as they state that anyone can be a validator/staker but we know those roles are (as of yet) permissioned. 

Does validator with no stake mean I can't post any new rollup blocks but I can execute l2 blocks to check them? If so, it would be analogous to full node / miner, right in L1 right?
undefined says Is [Nitro Migration Plan - Public](https://arbitrum.notion.site/Nitro-Migration-Plan-Public-54f8a375946849d4a01c7eeae89a9bd5) only need to be run by Arbitrum official? Do I need to migrate my own contract in Arbitrum One?
undefined says Yes! You do not have to do anything about that. We do provide a list of breaking changes Nitro brings with itself, you could take a look and make sure things are good on your side too:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp-migration.md
undefined says For upgrading from Arbitrum One to Nitro node. Can Nitro use existing One data directory without any modifications or do I need to export data like the Nitro migration plan? I mean `/some/local/dir/arbitrum` in `docker run`. Will Nitro node sync from 08-31 or 400 days ago of Arbitrum One?
undefined says HUGE BUG
undefined says fix
undefined says transactions down
undefined says Anyone from the Arbitrum team have time to take a quick look at these questions? I posted in eth research forum asking the designer of the Adamantium system (an alternative DA design) to compare and contrast the trust assumptions / trade-offs vs. Arbitrum AnyTrust, particularly the **bolded** bits: https://ethresear.ch/t/adamantium-power-users/9600/17

> 1) **DAC Is a previously chosen close permissioned quorum**. The reason is that if you add unknown members and many go offline they turn the system to fully on-chain data one. Which defeats the purpose of anytrust. With PU one can be more permissive with who can become a PU. In the worst case they’d join and then be withdrawn if they don’t function. Asking for a deposit to cover that cost makes it an easier case.
> 
> 2) In the case some DAC members don’t sign all batch data goes on chain. In the case where some PUs don’t sign their withdrawal data goes on-chain (so different data in those cases)
> 
> 3) **Trust level in anytrust is that DAC can steal all funds. This is worse than Validium (DAC can freeze the funds) and both are worse than Adamantium (where users can be fully trustless)**
> 
> 4) Anytrust is described for a general purpose rollup. Adamantium here is described for app specific use case. There can be a validity rollup with the same mechanism as anytrust, and Adamantium can be expended to a general logic, but this is not what is being described here. It requires more thought.
undefined says tagging @hunter | Offchain Labs for visibility -- any idea who in here might be able to take a look at this?
undefined says for classic nodes, follow these instructions https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Running_Node. However, run scripts/build-docker-local then the name of the docker image is "arb-node" instead of "offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.4-7b84e5e"
undefined says 5
undefined says I have some questions about the "Nitro Migration Plan" https://arbitrum.notion.site/Nitro-Migration-Plan-Public-54f8a375946849d4a01c7eeae89a9bd5. 1/ When is nitroStep3 run? 2/ The doc lists "Launch the nitro sequencers" and "Activate the nitro sequencer" as distinct steps. Can anyone provide further info on what the difference is?
undefined says If an L1 -> L2 tx is sent during the scheduled downtime for the Nitro upgrade, will the tx eventually get relayed to Arbitrum after the chain is up and running again?

<https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs/status/1563297895549243393>
undefined says No. You can't submit txs during the upgrade. The sequencer will be rejecting all txs and the delayed inbox will revert if you send txs to it. It will only be 2-4 hours of planned network downtime though (see #💻︱dev-announcements )
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says No, but we will provide new data snapshot once we upgrade.
undefined says Can someone help me find out which protocol this contract belongs to?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/token/0xec7c0205a6f426c2cb1667d783b5b4fd2f875434?a=0x8f44c726a33644c52c7e27ac6331adcb898f436a
undefined says I've never used Curve but I have this token, can't recall
undefined says Is there any info (even a link to the source code) on what the response from the sequencer will be during those 2-4 hours? I.e. will connections simply be refused or will the sequencer respond with some error message in JSON
undefined says You need to specify the version in that file.
undefined says The sequencer’s feed will shut down during that time, and others node which provide rpc service will not have state updates during that time.
undefined says One thing needs to note is dac only sign for the da, not the state (the state also staked by validator, that why we still need 7 days’ fraud proof window in nova), they don’t guarantee for any l2 state include l2->l1 tx’s state
undefined says Thanks for responding Jason! 

Fair then to reduce the incremental trust assumptions that come with anytrust chains down to “1 of N with a much smaller N”?

Is there a meaningful liveness tradeoff here vs a full OR w/ L1 DA? ie in the scenario where N-1 of the DAC is withholding data, how long do L1 nodes have to wait until that last, live honest node makes data available? Or does the chain fall back into rollup mode before this even happens?
undefined says hi'
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/inside-anytrust.md#data-availability-certificates you can see this docs, there is a expiration time for them to keep the data, at least 2 weeks, 2 weeks is much longer than the fraud proof windows (7 days), so it’s enough for validator to have a stake.
undefined says We have to wait until after the migration to start the nitro node, correct? And is there anything to sync (so will there be a delay until the node is usable) or does nitro start from scratch?
undefined says Yup, and we will publish a latest snapshot on that migration day.
undefined says Which testnet currently has the Nitro upgrade?
undefined says Already responded in the #🧪︱goerli 🙂
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/961349868612386856/1014184944035168357
undefined says Do the hardware requirements for a full node change after the Nitro migration?
undefined says Yes.  Nitro node requirements are equivalent to a standard go-ethereum node.
undefined says Will the lifetime period of a retryable ticket always be approximately one week, no matter what submission cost is used?

Reference <https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/L1_L2_Messages#ethereum-to-arbitrum-retryable-tickets>

> If no gas is provided or the execution reverts, it will be placed in the L2 retry buffer, where any user can re-execute for some fixed period (roughly one week).
undefined says Yes, it's currently one week.
undefined says Thank you. Do you know if there are any plans to change it substantially (either up or down)?
undefined says There isn't any plan to change it. 
You could take a look at the retryable ticket section (section 3.2.4) of the Nitro whitepaper too.
undefined says Lfg
undefined says The migration. As arb-one node operators, we only need to wait for the official upgrading to finish. And we launch a nitro RPC node with an official data snapshot. Am I right? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says And you need to use the node with version 2.0.0
undefined says Copy that.
undefined says Any idea how much storage space will be necessary to run a node after the nitro migration? Will the DB be the same size as before or different since it will now be geth format?
undefined says Congrats to the devs :arbheart:
undefined says After migration, it might around 28gb, however, it is highly recommended to prepare much larger than this.
undefined says Is the migration done?
undefined says Nope, it will start at 10:30 PM UTC-4 , and last about 2-4 hours
undefined says nice looking forward to it!
undefined says this is arbitrum Nitro Source code？ @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases
undefined says yes
undefined says Is there a tutorial on how to build a node from Arbitrum Nitro source code
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says 10:30 AM ET / GMT-4
undefined says not PM
undefined says Hey, any idea of the size of the seed DB & the est. release time?
undefined says Thanks for correct
undefined says The db will be around 28gb, but the snapshot should be compressed and less than this.
undefined says awesome, thx
undefined says Hey, I have a general question. So as I read in the docs, as for now, a sequencer manages all transactions. Being an aggregator or validator is permissionless. So, how many validators are actually on Arbitrum? 😅
undefined says Users can also send tx to delayed inbox. We have some orgs to run validators, and here is our contract, you can check our validator’s registration logs here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xC12BA48c781F6e392B49Db2E25Cd0c28cD77531A
undefined says Thanks for your answer. So there is no "clear" amount of validators checkable?
undefined says So the whole network will be offline for 2-4 hours starting at 14:30 UTC?
undefined says Can transactions still be submitted via the delayed inbox?
undefined says no
undefined says this has been asked three times already and apparently it's not gonna get answered. the best approximation i could  get without doing lots of work was getting `getStakerCounts()` or similar in the bridge contract 

that should give you, as i understand it, the amount of validators actually participating on the network 

it's been between 1 and 2 lately. i called it on sunday it was 1. afterwards it has always been 2.
undefined says Good to know, thank you 👌 The function currently return *2* . I read on Reddit that validator images are not available, yet.
Edit: That was 9 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/Arbitrum/comments/rf26oc/runing_full_node/)
undefined says Aha. Apparently not possible to run your own nodes, not even locally (at least not easily). Only 1-2 validators around.
undefined says Don't get me wrong all L2 right nows facing problems just wish it was more straightforward to know the actual state of the network and how mature it is
undefined says It will release sometime between 4:30 PM and 6:30 PM UTC -4
undefined says I mean, you can run a "normal" node or not? https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Running_Nitro_Node
But the docs miss the hardware requirements 😅
undefined says @minesword I haven't tried it. I've hard it's difficult for some reason or another, but this might be wrong
undefined says I did check validators 🙂
undefined says The hardware requirement is the same as geth.
undefined says But if you want to run our classic node for some reasons(noted classic node won’t sync the latest state), it would be AWS z1d 2xlarge.
undefined says When upgrade?
undefined says Starts in 1 min and lasts for ~2-4 hrs.
undefined says So I shouldn't do anything now until next 4 hrs, right?
undefined says go outside, eat some food
undefined says Cannot compute...
undefined says 01100101 01110010 01110010 01101111 01110010
undefined says waiting for snapshot
undefined says is it released?
undefined says Hasn’t released
undefined says wait
undefined says 0x03278f65EF947eEE7876FE2680CAF460812903E9 can someone help me out with 0.0001 eth on arbitrum network I need it for gas fees
undefined says How does the interactions with the L1 work? Are there periodic checkpoints in addition to the fraud proofs for withdrawals?
undefined says How long does Snapshot need？
undefined says Please wait a bit more. It will be released soon!
undefined says Any reason for the announcement been removed?
undefined says Hi folks, the seed DB for nitro nodes is now available here: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
undefined says $ sha256sum arb1-nitro.tar
a609773c6103435b8a04d32c63f42bb5fa0dc8fc38a2acee4d2ab2d05880205c  arb1-nitro.tar
undefined says Guys is it done yet ?
undefined says We'll announce it once the upgrade process is finished! 🚀
undefined says :arbiblobblue:
undefined says IS there a way to track progress?
undefined says Nope, but we will update you right after it's done! ⏰
undefined says Token wen
undefined says Arbitrum does not have a native token
undefined says Mi familia will go cold this winter
undefined says 🥲
undefined says wondering if it's not done yet why there are transactions happening on L2 Nitro already?
undefined says Getting `failed: stream error: stream ID 3; INTERNAL_ERROR; received from peer` while downloading the snapshot
undefined says What's the explorer URL you're using?
undefined says I'm seeing the market trade data on bottom left here https://swap.arken.finance/tokens/arbitrum/0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1
undefined says Lots of folks are trying to download and system is overloaded. try again please!
undefined says is there a way to set a different "mount point inside the docker image" to something other than home/user/.arbitrum ?
undefined says googled something about docker, think i get it now
undefined says I guess it will be closer to 4 hours
undefined says when doing --init.url="file:///path/to/nitro.tar" it keeps saying no such file or directory (when it definitely exists)
undefined says the instructions say
undefined says Or use --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar" to use a local snapshot archive
undefined says what do they mean by path to snapshot in container?
undefined says Please see this tutorial:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says use --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar" to use a local snapshot archive
undefined says put nitro.tar in container folder
undefined says did the snapshots get published?
undefined says Yup! 
"https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says 
undefined says Just wait for the network to be normal？
undefined says isn't pre-nitro database going to be used now?
undefined says looks like your node is ready
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs getting nonce too low error even though i looked it up before with w3.eth.get_transaction_count or whatever the method is
undefined says i can just hotfix and put nonce + 1 but might be a bug? not sure
undefined says nevermind i think it fixed itself somehow it works like before now
undefined says nice
undefined says if I run docker with `-v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum`, I should see some data in my local dir right?
undefined says cause it's still empty even though the node seems to be running fine
undefined says you should
undefined says nevermind, this is for sure a problem i have had working transactions and then following txes with nonce + 1 gave me "nonce too low" error
undefined says might be very high load on the sequencer right now?
undefined says there is a new error with nonces i think
undefined says if you send 2 tx back to back, with nonce and nonce + 1, the sequencer is rejecting the 2nd tx rather than putting both on chain
undefined says if both tx are sent very close together in time
undefined says that might be a loading balancer issue since we don't have mempool
undefined says Hey where can i learn more about arbitrum
undefined says Seems like there is too much in front of eyes
undefined says Nitro , nova , bla bla
undefined says where to start ? @M L | ConsenSys
undefined says You can start from reading our docs:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/
undefined says and Why the official Arbitrum one bridge doesn't qualify for odessy ?
I have bridge using that multiple times
?
undefined says did the hardware requirements change with the nitro upgrade? they got lower or rather stayed the same?
undefined says Nitro node requirements are equivalent to a standard go-ethereum node
undefined says Please ask the question on #🚀︱odyssey channel
undefined says i have a question i m trying to start my node from local snapshot i might be doing something stupid but this is my starting command:
undefined says ```sudo docker run --rm -it  -v /data/arbitrum-mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 127.0.0.1:8547:8547 -p 127.0.0.1:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.0-292bbc4 --l1.url xxx --l2.chain-id 42161 --init.url="file:/data/snapshot/nitro.tar"
```
undefined says giving me the following error:
undefined says ```couln't open init '/data/snapshot/nitro.tar' archive: open /data/snapshot/nitro.tar: no such file or directory```
undefined says even though the file is there for sure, when i do
undefined says ```ls /data/snapshot/
```
undefined says i get
undefined says ```nitro.tar```
undefined says maybe someone can tell me where my brain stopped functioning 😄
undefined says (been trying to follow the official docs)
undefined says put the the nitro.tar file in the container folder.
path should be : 
file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar
undefined says Read this doc: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says ahh okay this might be it thank you! need to move my container folder then i guess because my root volume does not have enough space
undefined says but thanks for the help it was not clear to me it has to be in the container folder
undefined says also this happens even if you dont send txes back to back but on single txes aswell on my end
undefined says Thanks! will looking into it
undefined says happened about ~3/15txes for me i guess
undefined says yeah i think you're right
undefined says i m guessing it's due to high load because waiting for transaction receipt takes way longer than usual (~10 seconds)
this is just my observations from a few txes so take it with a grain of salt
undefined says ```ValueError: {'code': -32000, 'message': 'intrinsic gas too low'}
```
undefined says anyone else getting this?
undefined says i m putting 100 gwei and i have more than enough ETH on wallet
undefined says Are you hardcoding gas limit?
undefined says yes but it should be more than enough
undefined says 1.75 million
undefined says on txes that take ~800k
undefined says same settings on txes that have worked before (after nitro upgrade) but got this error 2 times now
undefined says is there a UI bug in mm that displays incorrect gas price for nitro txs?
undefined says Gas on arbitrum is two dimensional (see this: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9) and may change based on call data price and also L2 gas price. Try transactions with higher limit or use estimateGas
undefined says i ll go higher limit just thought it was weird because it worked well for a very long time - will report back if i have more problems
undefined says thanks for the quick support guys apprieciate it
undefined says It's not a bug. Metamask have hardcoded 1.5 Gwei maxPriority fee. But on Arbitrum transactions are servered as first come first served so user don't need to put maxPriority fee. 
So by default if you need to pay 0.1 base fee for Arbitrum, metamask will add it up by 1.5 and maxFeePerGas will be 1.6 gwei. However the surpluss will be paid back to the user, but it's a mess on UX. We discussed it with MM team. hope they remove this default maxPriority fee
undefined says can anyone suggest what is wrong?
undefined says your L1 node is not compatible with our node software
undefined says ah
undefined says i have had a few txes now and it seems to be fixed at this moment
undefined says is erigon compatible?
undefined says as long as it don't have a limit on the getlog range
undefined says switched to ergion, it works now.. thanks!
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs nevermind 😄 i can work around it for now but still seems to be a problem
undefined says or wait i can give more info actually
undefined says the transaction gives that error but will still go through - i am assuming it is similar to the "invalid nonce" error before the nitro upgrade which happened from time to time with the transaction still getting processed
undefined says change your container volume
undefined says i had the same problem
undefined says was a little different to me because i downloaded the snapshot manually before and not put an url on --init.url
undefined says and i had to put it in my docker volume/change docker ovlume to non root because not enough space
undefined says ye if you downloaded it you need to put it in your docker volume
undefined says need to change your docker volume from root to whatever you have mounted with more space
undefined says I keep getting "missing trie node" error while calling  debug_traceTransaction for pre-nitro transactions. The node is running --node.rpc.classic-redirect param with archive classic node  url provided in it. What could be the problem?
undefined says the geth tracing api `debug_*` is only available for txs that happened after the nitro migration
for txs from before the migration you need to use the parity tracing api `trace_*`

https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module
undefined says ```{'code': -32000, 'message': 'queue full'}```
undefined says another new error
undefined says Thanks Mehdi. Is there anything I can do on my side on this screen to prevent it from displaying this way OR save money on gas? Or leave it untouched?
undefined says just lower priority fee, also it doesnt affect the money you "save" you will spend way less than indicated. it basically shows the max amount you can spend
undefined says Got it. Thanks. Just to be clear, if I do lower it, this wont affect the speed at which my txs are confirmed because of how txs are  "first come first serve". It will only "lower" how it is displayed even though the "real" cost is much lower. Is that correct, @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs ?
undefined says in the end i just extended my volume for the temporary snapshot file
undefined says kinda dirt workaround i know but couldnt be bothered anymore lol
undefined says :arbitrumkitty:
undefined says hey, saw a large spike in demand for txs - so the sequencer rejected your tx with this. if you try submitting your tx again it should work
undefined says i understand - just trying to figure out if this is like a one time error or it happens at times and i need to handle it on my end
undefined says shouldn't happen frequently, but still possible
undefined says do I need to enable namespace in api configuration? Im getting method trace_transaction does not exist/is not available
undefined says same for arbtrace_transaction
undefined says should work on `arbtrace_` 
you need a classic node running too, which you can point your nitro node to with 
`--node.rpc.classic-redirect=<classic node RPC>`
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Hey there, trying to spin up a arbone-nitro node. After the snapshot download, it fails with

any idea?
undefined says classic node is running along with nitro node, nitro node has this parameter  --node.rpc.classic-redirect=http:// 127.0.0.1:9547 which point on classic node. But still, requests fails. Log: Served arbtrace_transaction              conn=127.0.0.1:54240 reqid=1 duration="16.21µs" err="the method arbtrace_transaction does not exist/is not available"
undefined says sup! i’m looking at the Inbox smart contract and i see that it is possible to send a L1 -> L2 message using the `sendContractTransaction` method:
- why is there a `value` argument if the function is not payable?
- retryable tickets check that `gasLimit*maxFeePerGas` but this method does not, how does the contract pay for L2 execution if no value is sent?
undefined says Congrats Arbitrum team on a smooth Nitro launch!
undefined says working alright now. only difference I can tell is that geth l1 finished generating its snapshot
undefined says the value and gas can be paid from ur L2 alias address
undefined says the message will be lost if you don't have sufficient eth or the tx revert on L2 for whatever reason, that's why we have retryable tickets
undefined says Have noticed the nitro medium article lists this: 

> Ethereum L1 gas compatibility, bringing pricing and accounting for EVM operations perfectly in line with Ethereum.

Any clarification on this? It seems like arbgas is still used with > 500k gas used for transfers*
undefined says The opcode we calculate on l2 is the same cost as l1, for example, for eth transfer is also 21000 on l2, but users need to pay l1 gas and will add l1 cost directly on it, so the shows is more than 21000.
undefined says anyway to check the actual breakdown?
undefined says I see, thanks for the explanation. So gas used will scale while gas price remains relatively constant? Any concerns about gas limit estimation/failure from fluctuating gas usage?
undefined says We just have released a new version to fix gas estimation: https://twitter.com/arbitrumdevs/status/1565161996789714945?s=21&t=eYRpKsFTOW3Oi4omLxUuRQ
undefined says Sorry you mean what breakdown?
undefined says how much gas units for execution in l2, how much for posting to l1
undefined says The gas units for l2 is the same as l1 evm opcode unit. And for l1 posting, it varies by time, you can call this contract to see: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol
undefined says i mean for a given tx, how can we check what amount of total gas used was for execution and what amount was for posting to l1
undefined says maybe good to have that breakdown on arbiscan
undefined says Sir, I got a little confused between validators and sequencer roles in arbitrum
Can you tell me what is exactly the difference between them? 
Are validators for data availability solutions like nova? And sequencers for roll ups solutions?
undefined says hard to tell actual costs of a certain contract call if gas used depends on l1 gas for instance, if you are benchmarking, good to see what were the execution costs alone, ignore the l1 costs
undefined says Use eth_getTransactionReceipt(there is gasUsedForL1 field), but for now there is some issues on this, we are having a fix.
undefined says Sequencer managers post user’s tx to l1, and only tx. But validator will post the state they think is right, or they can stake others state. Validator also alive on arbitrum nova.
undefined says how does one become a validator on arbitrum nitro/ nova?
undefined says Currently have whitelist.
undefined says I see the gas price sitting at a floor of 0.1 gwei, I'm guessing that is an intentional choice to prevent bloat from spam?
undefined says Is permissionless validation and fraud proofs the next top priority for Arbitrum?
undefined says yes that is an intentional choice
undefined says we will first expand our whitelist
undefined says nitro node uses waaay less cpu/memory, good job guys 😄
undefined says I have a question about the AnyTrust protocol if anyone can answer them:

- How do validators compute the state of the rollup if they don't have access to transaction data (since sequencers won't publish it to L1 as calldata)? 

The classic rollup protocol allows nodes to check the validity of state updates (by comparing final state roots). 

But if Nova nodes can't access transaction data (and compute the new state), how can they know if the sequencer is processing invalid transactions, and initiate a fraud proof?

- What is the difference between a Layer 2 Nitro block (I assume this is produced by the sequencer) and an "RBlock"? This question is mostly related to the Arbitrum One protocol, though.
undefined says Hi, although sequencer doesn’t send those data to l1, it send those to dac, validators or others node can pull those data from dac.
The block you see from arbiscan is built by sequencer, and it is almost same as ethereum l1 block, also, if you call rpc service, the block information you get is also this type block. The rollups block is used for validator to stake state and push the state (also where fraud proof happens), when a rollups block is finialized, the l2->l1 tx state which include in this rollup block will be moved to l1 outbox so users can execute it.
undefined says is https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum obsolete now? will it eventually turn into read-only?
undefined says Can't seem to access the websocket endpoint on the nitro docker - According to the logs it only starts the HTTP server. Am I missing a config setting?
undefined says —ws.addr=0.0.0.0
undefined says You need add this
undefined says (would be great if you could add this to the docs)
undefined says Okay, so this is where the trust assumption in AnyTrust comes from—the DAC is trusted to provide tx data to an honest validator watching the chain?

Also, can regular users pull data from the DAC? Or how do they generate Merkle proofs for performing L2 > L1 withdrawals?
undefined says Yes, everyone can use the hash to get the related data: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/inside-anytrust.md#data-availability-servers
undefined says The l2->l1 send root is sent by validators.
undefined says Alright. Thanks for clarifying.
undefined says whats happening to gas
undefined says extremely high - its using 5million instead of the usual ~700k
undefined says L1 base fee is spiking.
undefined says Fees on Arbitrum is two dimensional, because Arbitrum stack consumes two different resources. Resources on L2, like computation/storage, and L1 calldata needed for transactions footprint to be posted to L1 by sequencer. 
The amount of gas needed to be payed depends on the L1 calldata price. So if the L1 base fee spikes, the L2 gas for transactions will be increased as well. 
For more detail please take a look at https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says I see thank you 🙂
undefined says Also i m not sure if you need this feedback but during the last couple minutes my txes got alot of "nonce too low" errors (way more than usual) but they still went through normally under a different hash
undefined says Thanks for your report! Looking to it!
undefined says Hey! What's the rpc that would work for hardhat fork tests? We tried alchemy, infura and quicknode but all do not work.
undefined says Have you received "Typed transaction unknown" error?
undefined says because of this? https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2995
undefined says Yup!
undefined says This not relevant to RPC! Thats because we're using Type transaction in Nitro and Hardhat has an error for unknown typed transactions. You can bypass this error with the instructions, @gzeon | Offchain Labs described in that issue.
undefined says Got it sir, so alchemy, quicknode or infura should all work for the hardhat fork testing? Or any specific provider works?
undefined says Yeah all will be the same!
undefined says Are you still hitting this issue? are you querying for nonces dynamically?
undefined says 13minutes ago i had one yes, i manually set the nonce to nonce + 1 after each transaction
undefined says but i had the problem before aswell when querying w3.eth.get_transaction_count on each transaction
undefined says that was on classic tho where the error was called "invalid transaction nonce", now its "nonce too low" the result is the same
undefined says i can send you the tx hashes in dm if you need them
undefined says Yeah that would be cool
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs sent request
undefined says Hey, is there an official roadmap for Arbitrum?
undefined says Never heard of it.you can check #🔗︱links for all infos and docs.
undefined says How do I calculate total transaction fee using eth_getTransactionReceipt?
undefined says I understand that it's cumulativeGasUsed * effectiveGasPrice
undefined says but what about "gasUsedForL1" ?
undefined says Previously there was a feestats field which included L1 Gas price data
undefined says Dating back here, been waiting for arbitrum nitro since this day 😄
undefined says #💻︱protocol
undefined says Hey folks, I wrote down my thoughts on comparing the VMs: Wasm vs. a RISC based VM. 

The conclusion is not in Arbitrum's favor, but I figured you might still be interested. 

https://twitter.com/pepyakin/status/1565378422205030400

I am a fan of Wasm though, and would be happy if you changed my mind!
undefined says > https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#cool-new-stuff

> "Ethereum L1 Gas Compatibility 🥳: Gas pricing and accounting for EVM operations is be perfectly in line with L1; no more ArbGas." 
> Although in Nitro L2 opcodes are now priced the exact same as Eth L1 - you still have to pay for the L1 calldata (which gets represented as L2 gas units). Your transactions' gas used won't be the same as Eth L1 but during contract execution the opcode cost and gasleft interactions are now better aligned with Eth L1. Read more here.
> 
How can I calculate L1 calldata cost? Is it simply the same as regular calldata cost on Mainnet (4 gas for zero bytes, 16 gas for non-zero bytes)? I'm so confused and my whole application is broken (my fault) but, I'd really appreciate some help, thanks! 🙂
undefined says gasUsed = gasUsedL1 + gasUsedL2(not a field)
undefined says so 
gasPaid = gasUsed * effectiveGasPrice
gasPaidL1 = gasUsedL1 * effectiveGasPrice
gasPaidL2 = (gasUsed - gasUsedL1) * effectiveGasPrice
undefined says And is (gasUsed - gasUsedForL1) identical to original EVM computation costs? Thanks!
undefined says Also is there a way to calculate the L1 Gas Price during the time of transaction? I was previously using feeStats.l1Calldata to approximate
undefined says yes
undefined says I don't think so, you can call this with an archive node tho
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/f7645453cfc77bf3e3644ea1ac031eff629df325/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L93
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Final question, what is the exact block number arbitrum migrated to Nitro at?
undefined says We do actually compile into a simpler ISA called WAVM, which we document here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/proving/wasm-to-wavm.md
undefined says The reason why we start with WASM itself is that it has an incredible amount of support and tooling, which we take advantage of and will continue to use
undefined says That and the reasons you mention in your article
undefined says We benefit from the fact that wasm was made as a web standard, which means we inherent from a mature ecosystem of tools and projects
undefined says Yeah, diving into that was a final straw before writing the article
undefined says Yeah, I actually wanted to dive into the point of tooling, but it was already getting long )

The tooling is a big selling point. I see 2 major parts to it: toolchains and execution engines. You can take Go, C or Rust, and compile down to WebAssembly.

But so can you compile down to a RISC.

And you don't care about execution engines, AFAIK, since during normal operation I assume you rely on normally natively compiled geth.
undefined says Is there any other wasm tooling you use?
undefined says 👀
undefined says bump 🙂 going through blocks on arbiscan isn't fun

I think it's somewhere around ~22213298
undefined says why is the callvalue of a retryable burned if not redeemed instead of being refunded?
undefined says actually there’s a conflict between the whitepaper and the documentation, the whitepaper says it gets burned while the docs says it goes to a beneficiary
undefined says or am i getting it wrong?
undefined says Hey! Wanted to know if there is a way to know destination transaction from arbitrum bridge using the ethereum deposit transaction.
undefined says ?
undefined says Before nitro we could calculate the transaction hash using the mainnet deposit transaction hash.
undefined says Any explanation of what this address is doing in every arb block? https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b05
undefined says Hi, those tx sent from this address is `StartBlock()` function, which make bookkeeping action traceable. They are the first tx in every sequencer block.
undefined says From our sdk, we do have such functions: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/c-nitro-stable/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L655 , You can refer to how the sdk does it
undefined says Hmm, checking
undefined says there a channel just for discussing node operation?
undefined says Congratulations on a successful launch guys!
undefined says This channel can
undefined says Thanks！
undefined says What issue do you meet?
undefined says `WARN [09-02|03:42:41.961] Head state missing, repairing            number=22,426,337 hash=74280f..c00484 snaproot=e8550c..2e3539`
I stuck here after upgrading my node to the latest version
undefined says How long will it take?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is the new upgrade to nitro a way to control costs by varying Gas rather than Gas Price?
undefined says seems your database get crashed
undefined says Did you suddenly stop it before?
undefined says The gas is now same as the standard evm opcode cost.
undefined says I have a quick question about the validators. 

Who are the currently whitelisted validators? All I can find in the docs (https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/seq-or-val) or mainnet beta section (https://developer.arbitrum.io/mainnet-beta) are sections that say that validators are currently whitelisted but not who is currently on the whitelist.

```
Arbitrum One's Validator set is currently whitelisted; overtime, the whitelist will grow and then be removed entirely. For more info see "Mainnet Beta".
```
undefined says We haven’t announced this yet
undefined says Wait, what does that mean? Who do I currently trust for the correctness of the rollup? 
From the docs and the code it seems that only the whitelisted validators can submit sequencer fraud.
undefined says Does that mean that I currently fully have to trust that the sequencer is behaving honestly, since without a validator to watch it, it could introduce a fraudulent state transition that transfers all funds to a different wallet.
undefined says The sequencer only posts user’s tx, and not post the state, when sequencer post those tx into l1, anyone can read it and execute it to the latest state, if you trust someone’s node or you run your own node, you can directly trust that state, this is why we call rollup is 1/n security model, because only 1 node on this network is honest then you can always get the right state.
undefined says What do you need validators for then and why are they currently whitelisted?
undefined says Validator will stake the state, but others fullnode won’t, which means they will be slashed if someone find they cheat, while fullnode cheat won’t. They are whitelist is because our system is 1/n security, not like 51% model(the  more validators number is, the more security the system is), in our model, we just make sure we have 1 validator honest and when it find someone is cheating it can make a challenge, also, if the number of validators large, will cause the system load heavy. Also we will continue to expand our validator number in the near future.
undefined says when is resume
undefined says Hey ! Can you also tell me how are you differentiating between nitro deposits and the previous deposits ?
undefined says You mean how to tell a deposit transaction is nitro deposit or classic deposit?
undefined says Yeap!
undefined says Exactly
undefined says Hmm, I think the easiest way is to use the block number to differentiate
undefined says i add this but the ws server is denying my request even when connecting from local machine, is there some cors or whitelist i need to configure?

rpc works fine for me
undefined says Can you guide me to that please ... I am not aware fully.
undefined says Wrote a cheeky article on Nitro: https://twitter.com/0xAtomist/status/1565613500218720256?s=20&t=Uxs7W9iktwIKqQJce-MDRA
undefined says Can you share with me your start instructions?
undefined says I mean, if we upgrade to nitro at l1 block n, then before block n, the deposit tx all are classic, after block n, all are nitro type.
undefined says aaah like that
undefined says yeah yeah
undefined says sorry for the dumb question
undefined says are (staking) validators new to nitro?
undefined says (vs. classic/pre-nitro arbitrum one)
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs do you by any chance know the block number. ?
undefined says ```

undefined says 15447144
undefined says checking
undefined says or is this staking part purely a mechanism to resolve disputes? Right, it is not quite the same as staking on let's say eth
undefined says We also have staking validator in classic
undefined says i see, thanks
undefined says in the tx lifecycle docs (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/tx-lifecycle) it says that usually the tx's are sent directly to the Sequencer (operated by Offchain labs). These tx's aren't routed through other nodes first?
undefined says It will router by others node
undefined says right okay the tx's just propegate through the network just like in ethereum l1
undefined says that's what I thought as well
undefined says thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Does this work in your classic node before?
undefined says Np
undefined says yup
undefined says Weird, seems right on your instructions. Do you try lsof to see which process on 8548?
undefined says 
undefined says nvm i managed to fix, looks like some networking issue with docker.

i add `--network="host"` and my ws can connect now

thanks for your help though 🙂
undefined says do we have a verdict? 😁
undefined says The content in our white paper is wrong, we will give it a fix, thanks!
undefined says Nice to hear that
undefined says keep getting this error since the update. Using hardhat commands. Can i get help with fix?
undefined says 
undefined says Hello! How can I convert gas units used in a ERC20 transfer on ETH to gas units used for a layer2(arbitrum) transfer? Thanks!
undefined says where can this latest snapshot be found?
undefined says is `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"` enough?
undefined says https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2995
undefined says Enough
undefined says There won’t be a fixed gas used on layer2, because our gas include l1 part, and will be different if l1 gas change, you should use eth_estimateGas to check before you send tx rather than use a fixed value.
undefined says Thanks! Having this gas fees calculator as an example: https://www.cryptoneur.xyz/gas-fees-calculator, we can see that a ERC20 transfer (21000 gas units used) costs 0.0333 $. Do you know how this value was computed? Because I'm trying to estimate the same cost using this formula: gasPrice * gasUsed(21000) and it gives me 0.0033 $ (so 0.0333/10)
undefined says And I'm sure that it doesn't care about the l1 gas change, I'm thinking that it's hardcoded somehow?
undefined says https://gasplorer.com/gasplorer?chain=arbitrum&currency=usd&period=1h
undefined says as you can see here
undefined says 21000 is eth transfer cost, not erc20 transfer cost. For this value it calculated by this 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 eth, then 0.000000001 x 21000 x 1500
undefined says Should be that value, this is how it calculate. But noted, the gas used (21000) is not right on l2 for ethers transfer, will be higher than that as I said above.
undefined says hmm.. where that 1500 comes from?
undefined says Ethers price
undefined says Is about 1500usd
undefined says Oh, it’s 1600 now lol
undefined says So, I had another question about "validators staking the state." I know the sequencer sends batches to L1 by calling one of the functions on the L1 contracts and passing the compressed data as calldata. 

But how do validators add new Rblocks to L1?

Then the other question is related to the AnyTrust chains:

- When does the chain revert to a rollup? In places, it says this happens if the sequencer cannot get a DA Certificate from the DAC. But I also saw in another section that the same thing happens if there's a challenge. It'd be great if you can explain this part. Thanks.
undefined says Also send tx to l1 contract to produce rollup block. For 2nd question, it will revert if we don’t have enough signature on the same data. And the dac just manages the tx da, not manage the state, they won’t sign on state, the state still processed by validators, so there still might be challenge
undefined says Thanks! Seems like the problem was that I've wiped one zero from eth price lol
undefined says I have a question
undefined says I ran ```docker run --rm -it  -v /home/admin/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.1-c48b8be --l1.url <redacted> --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"```
undefined says this is the error message I received
undefined says ```revision: development, vcs.time: development

Sample usage:                  /usr/local/bin/nitro --help
unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1: permission denied```
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Have you seen this before? I just spinned an EC2 instance, installed docker and ran this command
undefined says we have found a critical issue with Nitro update.  Any help please,  how we can report an issue?
undefined says Our Solidity smart contracts deployed  on Arbitrum were using tx.gasprice EVM supported parameter,  also supported on Arbitrum One.

Now,  with Nitro,  this parameter returns 0 with the latest update,  breaking our core contract logic.
undefined says sudo
undefined says I'm coming back with another question: we know that the base fee is ~0.1(gwei). For a 21000 gas units operation on Arbitrum(almost), we get: 0.1 * 0.000000001 * 21000* 16000 . So why you used directly 1 gwei instead of 0.1? Thanks!
undefined says sudo docker run... ?
undefined says working thanks
undefined says same result
undefined says hmmmm. I was tryna run it on raspberry pi. but on my pc server
undefined says seems to work locally on my own PC, but not on AWS ec2
undefined says check the permission of `/home/admin/.arbitrum` on your host
undefined says e.g. easy way to fix is `chmod -fR 777 /home/admin/.arbitrum`
undefined says didn't seem to do the trick
undefined says `drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Sep  2 12:33 /home/admin/.arbitrum/`
undefined says is there already an `arb1` folder inside?
undefined says no, but `chmod 0777 <dir>` did the trick
undefined says Because you just asked me how that website results that value lol.
undefined says So that value is not correctly computed? It should be 0.1 instead, am I right?
undefined says That website’s data is not suitable for arbitrum, as I said the gas used is not 21000 on arbitrum. It will be influenced by l1 gas price.
undefined says But if you’d have also the l1 gas price, what would be the correct formula?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#fees
undefined says Thanks! I ll have a look
undefined says Hi, I just have it a test on rinkeby-arbi, it returns as expected.
undefined says Is it right that my node has to sync for ~20 hours? Seems counterintuitive as the snapshot has just happened
undefined says arb1 nitro should sync in a matter of minutes with the snapshot downloaded
undefined says thanks, this is now indeed the case, thanks! I did a calculation on how long it would take but it jumped forward very fast
undefined says Okay. Can you link the L1 contract(s) in question? Tried looking through the codebase on GitHub, but I couldn't figure out which was which. 

Also, is the rule about reverting to a rollup is designed to prevent a malicious DAC from performing data withholding attack? And is it the case that the sequencer has two non-negotiable choices: either post a batch with a DA Certificate or post the full data to L1? 

Trying to figure if the "revert to rollup mode" feature is enforced at the protocol level, or if it's up to the sequencer to trigger it.
undefined says Are there official node requirements for an Arbitrum Nitro node? Seems as though the chain with the latest snapshot is *only 33 gb*!
undefined says yes,  was just discussing with @gzeon | Offchain Labs he was able to help,  it seems like a provider issue submitting gasPrice 0. thanks gzeon
undefined says we are using openzepelin defender,  seems they have issue with Arb Nitro  integration
undefined says mind you it will grow like 20gb per month
undefined says right okay that's fair, thanks!
undefined says ^^
undefined says Hey hey! 
Can we find the dest tx hash for erc20 deposits using l1 transaction hash.

Was getting a missing trie node error so I tried updating from `v2.0.0-292bbc4` to `v2.0.1-c48b8be`, it spun up for about 8 hours and when it finally finished it started with "ArbOS uninitialized". Any ideas as to how to fix this or what caused it?
undefined says In the Nitro setup docs it says "Use the parameter --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" on first startup to initialize Nitro database". Is it necessary to remove this flag after the snapshot has downloaded so that it doesn't attempt to re-download it on a restart?

any way to avoid this? getting it on almost every container restart, have to resync from scratch
undefined says yes, you can try and see if it works but I think it is indeed that
undefined says Just curious if I need to remove it. I still have it included right now, but would be very easy to remove it and restart the container
undefined says what went wrong here? it was working fine, after nitro upgrade.. but stopped syncing, now it's saying "rewinding till ancient limit"
undefined says use graceful shutdown whenever possible, e.g.
docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
not sure how it translate to k8s
also `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.2-90edb28` improves shutdown safety, but should still use graceful shutdown whenever possible
undefined says do I need the arbitrum sdk or additional logic derive the  correct gas estimate for a txn on arb Nitro?
undefined says please upgrade to 2.0.2 for any rewinding, corrupted state issues
undefined says normal eth_estimateGas would work fine
undefined says thanks, can I also ask what is the L2 Gast tracker bot is looking at? I'm trying to debug my application which seems to be miscalculating txn fees
undefined says the L2 gas price is 0.1 gwei now
undefined says ok, is it fixed price?
undefined says no
undefined says it might increase in congestion
undefined says 0.1 gwei is the floor
undefined says using eip-1559 style pricing?
undefined says we accept 1559 typed transactions, but we don’t take the tip, so whatever priority fee you specified we will charge 0 and refund
undefined says ok that helps alot! so I think that explains why my price calculations are off 👍
undefined says any chance you can have a look at this? we've tried updating to 2.0.2 and it wasn't any better so we went back to 2.0.0 @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says Delete your database and start fresh with 2.0.2
undefined says When you say start fresh do you mean resync from scratch? There’s no way to recover the state?
undefined says Correct, you have a corrupt database. 2.0.2 reduces change of getting a corrupt database, but always recommend graceful shutdown.  Just like go-ethereum on L1, it only saves to disk once an hour of execution time.
undefined says Is the Arbitrum Nitro update complete?
undefined says Yes the upgrade completed

undefined says Hey guys I think this is not the right channel, but is there a channel to post in for:

My team and I are launching a new protocol on arbitrum here soon with Odyssey and we were hoping that we could be listed on arbitrums list of money market protocols. https://portal.arbitrum.one/#lending
undefined says Is there a way to know how long it will take a message to propagate from L1 to Arbitrum with effectively 100% accuracy?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
```
Or use --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar" to use a local snapshot archive
```
undefined says ```
--ws.addr=0.0.0.0
```
undefined says partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says not sure what you mean, message posted to the delayed inbox can be force included to L2 after 24 hours
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says any problem with arb when the merge happen ?
undefined says The snapshot has to be hosted in the container, eg in /var/lib/docker/...
undefined says I am trying to read a snapshot file from another location and it keeps failing
undefined says 
undefined says sure you would need to mount the snapshot inside your container
undefined says thanks, I'll search how to do that ! (not very familiar with docker rn)
undefined says mind if I dm you quickly ? I am basically trying to persist the db in /data/arbitrum_node/ and my snapshot file has been downloaded in /data/arbitrum_snapshot. Not sure what -v option I should pass to my docker run command ?
undefined says `-v /path/in/host:/path/in/container`

will mount `/path/in/host`  in host to `/path/in/container` in container
undefined says I think I am getting it work but is there a way to not write files (when extracting the tar file for example) in /home/user ?
undefined says not sure what you mean
undefined says couln't extract init archive '///data/.arbitrum/snapshot/nitro.tar' err:Create file /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/065010.ldb: write /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/065010.ldb: no space left on device
undefined says /home/ubuntu on aws has very few space
undefined says did you mount `/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says you will need `-v /some/path/with/a/lot/of/space:/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says ```-v /data/.arbitrum:/home/ubuntu/.arbitrum --init.url=\"file:///home/ubuntu/.arbitrum/snapshot_tar/nitro.tar\" ```
undefined says this is what I tried
undefined says knowing that I did dl the nitro.tar file in /data/.arbitrum/snapshot_tar/nitro.tar
undefined says but when launching the node (and thus extracting the tar file) my /home/ubuntu dir quicly becomes full and thus it's failing @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says you can have multiple -v mount
undefined says actually this should solve your problem
```
-v /data/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum --init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum/snapshot_tar/nitro.tar" 
```
undefined says nitro-node write to `/home/user/.arbitrum` not `/home/ubuntu/.arbitrum`
undefined says yeah ok, it seems to be working now - I thought /home/user was just an example and should be replaced...
undefined says thanks a lot mate, appreciate you took some time to help a newbie 😉
undefined says np
undefined says Are there instructions on how to set up an own AnyTrust chain?
undefined says is it expected that my node update blocks information once every second ?
undefined says also how should one configure the ws server ?
undefined says my node does not seem to open a ws server
undefined says even with -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 as shown in the example
undefined says I see a line HTTP server started   in my log but nothing similar with WS ?
undefined says Yes
undefined says ```
--ws.addr=0.0.0.0
```
undefined says already tried but nothing happened
undefined says also setting --http.port does not seem to change the port (default to 8547 regardless of the value)
undefined says I think you are setting up the docker port wrongly
undefined says you can drop the -p flags and use `--network host` instead
undefined says ```sudo docker run --network host --rm -it -v /data/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.1-c48b8be --l1.url http://localhost:3000 --l2.chain-id=42161 --init.url=\"file:///home/user/.arbitrum/snapshot_tar/nitro.tar\" --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.port=8585 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.port=8586 --http.vhosts=*
```
undefined says this is what I am doing currently
undefined says it should work then?
undefined says it does not and even the http port is not being changed
undefined says HTTP server started                      endpoint=[::]:8547 auth=false prefix= cors=* vhosts=*
undefined says can you try to use `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.2-90edb28` instead
undefined says I don't think its related but the same thing worked on my machine
undefined says nothing changed with that version
undefined says can you add `--conf.dump` and dm me the output?
undefined says friend request sent
undefined says Hiii
undefined says What are the system requirements for running a full node?
undefined says Hioii
undefined says bumping :)
undefined says I might have used the wrong language 🙂

When I call `createRetryableTicket` <https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/3912a732b26a399811a424f19e8934d5fce5ec86/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L359> on L1, is there a way to know exactly how long it will be until that ticket gets created on L2?

For example, this L1 tx was sent at 01:51:47 PM and the ticket was created on Arbitrum at  01:55:55 PM, so it took 4:08 (but that is not true of other messages)

L1 tx: <https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8e427a7aec7a85b6c2cd78f419c90cb89de2f1254433517df4d864f016037b96>
L2 tx: <https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x0850bb8df57b01178f41c87c232e27be857dd70e85acaf7bf5f045d07bb4b150>
undefined says currently the sequencer wait for 20 blocks on mainnet
undefined says this will change after the merge and will wait until the epoch finalized
undefined says not something we support right now
undefined says same as geth
undefined says Why is it that under congestion the gas used by transactions increases, rather than the gas price? I see transactions that usually take 300K gas fail because they exceeded 1M gas limit, while the base fee doesn't increase above 0.1 gwei. Wouldn't it have been more consistent with other EVM chains if the gas usage was fixed and the gas price increased during congestion?
undefined says Gas used increases in response to congestion on L1, not L2. If the L1 price goes up, we need to charge more for tx data as it'll be posted to L1, but the price of L2 computation doesn't necessarily change.
undefined says Would it be possible to start such chain only with the software you share?
Would it be possible to create such chain as a partnership?
undefined says Are there any rewards for hosting a nitro or nova node? I can't find anything
undefined says our software license does not allow such use without written permission
undefined says there are no reward
undefined says Would it be possible to partner in order to create a new instance?
undefined says You can contact partnerships@offchainlabs.com to discuss
undefined says Perfect. Thank you
undefined says is there any public archive node
undefined says You should use 3rd party service like infura or alchemy
undefined says any snapshots for archive node?
undefined says If you want to run archive node, you need run 2 node, one is classic archive node, we have one snapshot (https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar), although this is not latest, but it may help. Then you should run a nitro node, and use flags --node.rpc.classic-redirect=<classic node RPC> to connect to your classic node. If you just need the archive data after nitro, just run nitro node is ok. Here is the details: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says any idea what are current storage requirements for archive node?
undefined says and post-nitro did the nvme requirements get any lenient?
undefined says around 500gb-600gb
undefined says For nitro node, just use the hardware for geth is ok, but it’s better to use NVMe to get a higher performance
undefined says Can I run Geth (Actually Erigon) and Nitro on the same computer? (not sure about the RAM reqs for Nitro)
undefined says Also, any guide without Docker, I'd rather not use it
undefined says you can
undefined says we don't support non-docker build but you can ref our dockerfile
undefined says ok, thanks, I hope my 32gb of ram are enough 😅
undefined says is it possible to convert a non-archive node to archive node or would i need to start from scratch?
undefined says Hey Fam 

If you are currently building on Arbitrum and need a product designer(UI&UX Designer).

I have worked on some web3 products on Solana ranging from DEX to web3 multi chain Mobile wallet,A social fi website, NFT marketplace platform, Portfolio Tracker and also many more.


You can reach out to me so we can build something usable on Arbitrum
undefined says Hey folks, are there any devs that would be willing to answer a few questions or give me some advice on the transferral of ownership of a smart contract for an nft collection? This is well outside my comfort zone.
undefined says Test
undefined says This is important imo. Even if you have 0.01 ETH the gas could display just a bit higher and return insufficient funds. https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/1016348088895541398

undefined says Ok J!
undefined says It seems your database is corrupted, please upgrade to our v2.0.2 and re-sync
undefined says Next time you stop the node should use graceful shutdown by docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
undefined says thanks for reply. i was running the v2.0.0. will the node automatically "re-sync" as you suggested when i start it again with docker but the v2.0.2 version?
undefined says You’d better delete your current database, and connect to our snapshot to download again.
undefined says Haha wanted to say it the other day but now the PR is open: we do indeed care about engines 🙂
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1079
undefined says Wasm's tooling and ecosystem are unmatched. If we had to do it all over again we'd definitely choose wasm
undefined says Test
undefined says bump
undefined says Hi, there might not be any much faster way for this, you need re-sync the node.

undefined says I'm having trouble deploying a contract to Arbitrum mainnet via Ethereum remix. Getting the following message `creation of Items errored: Invalid transaction params: params specify an EIP-1559 transaction but the current network does not support EIP-1559
`
Any ideas? I am using injected provider from metamask which has worked fine before.
undefined says It’s probably hit a node in the load balancer that was behind.
undefined says ~~Alright, any way to get past it? I'm still getting the error~~ Solution: changed to Alchemy as provider in Metamask and now it works fine.
undefined says Good morning,  I have checked out the Nitro git repo. Is there any doc on how to build and run the checkout locally?
undefined says I need to build a docker image independently from the source file and I believe there is something in the dockerfile https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile that I don't need, can you help me?
undefined says I just need a full node
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says We don’t have such a docs, you can refer to https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile to see how it build
undefined says What things you don’t need?
undefined says Is everything in this required?
undefined says Need nodes that support deposits/blocks for our exchange, we don't need cross-chain bridges, etc.
undefined says Hmm, you need run a node with full part because it may cause some errors if you miss something , and your node needs to sync the state, also needs many parts.
undefined says ok  thanks
undefined says Amazing! I'll replicate and port to CentOS.  It runs twice as fast
undefined says ./test-node.bash
undefined says `Couldn't find env file: /Users/xxx/xx/xxx/nitro/blockscout/nitro.env`
undefined says How did you run it locally and can you help me?
undefined says Ola
undefined says I never ran nitro locally...  I ported the  old node to CentOS,  packaged it up in an RPM that I could move around my different boxes and install and spin up in a two line shellscript
undefined says So I am planning to do the same for the nitro,  but that docker file is pretty big, it'll take me some time to port it
undefined says Basically I have an automated pipeline  which takes every tag of the git repo, builds it, packages it to rpm and sticks in a nexus repo. And that way I can deploy it with ease wherever I feel like
undefined says you can add `--no-blockscout` to disable blockscout
undefined says we don't really support non-docker build but it should be fairly easy to figure out
undefined says A few questions if I may 🙂
* Being a validator is currently whitelisted, so I understand s not possible to try for yourself. Is there a like to an onchain fraud-proof from start to finish? (goerli or mainnet), it is much easier to follow the process with an exmple.
* How much stake does a validator need to put on each batch? How much does the challenger? Is this likely to change in the future?
* Does every step (bisection) of the dispute require an additional stake that can be lost?
* Can there be more than one challenger to a batch during the dispute period?
* During the proof process, does the contract need access to the compressed transaction sequence to know which transaction should be executed at the final step?

* What happens if the sequencer publish an invalid transaction? e.g, a tx without a nonce? Alternatively,  if the compression algorithm creates a batch that is published incorrectly (e.g. cosmic ray bit flip), and this batch cannot be decrypted? is it the tx/batch ignored?

undefined says sending a pic as my message was blocked
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs i've sent you a friend request, can you see my message?
undefined says the hw requirment is same as geth
https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/ethereum-clients/geth/
undefined says thanks
undefined says last message was blocked. are any transactions that can be run on L1 available to be run on arbitrum?
undefined says does anyone know how to list the peers my node has connected to?
undefined says mostly yes
undefined says arbitrum node (nitro-node) is not p2p
undefined says ah interesting, so it all comes from the sequencer?
undefined says and L1
undefined says what i am trying to figure out is - what are the constraints
undefined says as in which transactions cannot be run / features are not supported
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arb-specific-things
undefined says hey everyone im getting a url timeout errors from the sequencer when i am submitting a raw tx to my own node pretty often. Can someone comment on if this is expected behavior or is there something i can do to fix it?
undefined says Should i be worried about this warnings in my node?

```
 WARN [09-06|21:53:50.584] Failed to find machines                  path=
```

and 

```
WARN [09-06|21:53:50.584] P2P server will be useless, neither dialing nor listening
```
undefined says warning that flags you specified aren't being used
undefined says hi, 1 currently there is no on chain challenge happens, but you can refer to test files: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/test/contract/arbRollup.spec.ts. 
2. The base stake is 1 ether, you can get that value here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef0d09d1e6204141b4d37530808ed19f60fba35#readProxyContract.
3.no need.
4. Every round challenge can only have 2 validators: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L339
4.every time make new rblock needs to check inbox.
5.if sequencer publish an invalid tx,  others node read the l1 inbox will ignore that tx.
undefined says What is gas cost per byte for calldata?
undefined says You can call this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L22 , this contract’s address is on top of this sol file.
undefined says thank you!
undefined says Amazing. Thank you!
So, does the contract have a way to decompress the calldata and figure out which tx it should execute on the one-step-proof?
Is it provided and compared in some way?
undefined says We use brotli as our compression algorithm, you can try this: https://github.com/google/brotli
undefined says other than the blocknumber and the syncing process, what does the Arbitrum Nitro node use the L1 node for?
undefined says Read l1’s inbox and check the tx.
undefined says i see, right that makes sense, thanks!~
undefined says what is the recommended way to shutdown the node because even when trying to gracefully end the process, at restart it says " head state missing, repairing"  without making any progress it seems
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1016528705444646985
undefined says thanks
undefined says 👍
undefined says Is there any example dapp that uses the sequencer feed for low latency communication?
undefined says Yes, this was mentioned in the paper.
I just wanted to know if the decmpression also needs to happen on the call data when executing a fraud proof. 
If I understand correctly, the bisection mechanism arrives at the final step, but then the contract must judge the exectution of the step.
For this, I assume, it must know the correct tx that was sequenced. I wonder how the judge contract gets this information and decompresses it
undefined says does the arbitrum nitro node support the IPC provider?
undefined says hmm ...
undefined says it does provide a HTTP provider but not so sure about the IPC provider ( as in https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)
undefined says I think we just support HTTP and websockets for now! I'll double check it
undefined says cool thanks!
undefined says does arbtrace_callMany / the OE trace namespace generally no longer work?
undefined says We're supporting Geth tracing apis after Nitro. See https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#rpcs
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/proving/osp-assumptions.md#block-headers
undefined says If now, with nitro, a tx's L2 gas expenditure is calculated and paid for in advance in L1, is the only way for a retryable ticket to fail on L2 execution related? Like for example with a bad formatted calldata?
undefined says If you want to call l2’s contract, it will also failed if your contract revert.
undefined says Exactly! So it could only fail due to execution, right? Contract reverting for Xs reason, whether it be bad construction of data, bad logic, reverting, etc
undefined says also will fail if your gas price or gas limit is not enough
undefined says Got it
undefined says Thanks, Jason
undefined says mainnet-sequencer-nitro.mainnet.svc.cluster.local:8547 context deadline exceeded
undefined says how come so many errors
undefined says arbitrum sequencer down?
undefined says how can we run nitro on rasberipi
undefined says How will the network operate during the upgrade to the Merge? Is there any expected downtime?
undefined says When creating a retryable ticket with generic callData (function call to L2 dapp deployed on arbitrum) via Arbitrum's Layer 1 Delayed Inbox, which contracts/testnets can we track the transaction on? This is on Goerli btw. I'm receiving a ticketId back but can't see my transaction on Goerli with the following address: 0x6BEbC4925716945D46F0Ec336D5C2564F419682C . Is this correct? Second, where should I expect my transaction to show up on L2, on which contract address ? Appreciate it 🙏
undefined says is there any documentation on the sequencer feed?
undefined says also is it possible to submit transactions to the sequencer via websockets?
undefined says i see in past messages people were able to connect to `wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws` to submit transactions, but i can't seem to establish a connection myself. is this endpoint still active?
undefined says No, we only provide an HTTPS RPC. If you'd like a websocket RPC, check out 3rd party node providers: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/node-providers
undefined says got it thanks for clarifying. i would like to understand the messages that come from the sequencer feed (`wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`), do you know if there is any documentation on the fields being reported?
undefined says Not that I'm aware of, you'll have to read the code unfortunately
undefined says is there a list of the nova signers and public keys anywhere?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/for-devs/cross-chain-messsaging
undefined says how do i solve this "couln't extract init archive '/tmp/nitro.tar' err:Create file /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/060066.ldb: open /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/060066.ldb: no space left on device

undefined says you're out of disk space, free some up
undefined says how can i mount a ssd to docker?
undefined says docker's `-v` supports mounting a path on the host machine into docker, see https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node for details
undefined says You can check your retryables on this site: https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/ , just put your l1 tx id on it is ok.
undefined says Currently there is no planed downtime, merge won’t affect the eco system on ethereum.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says I am also getting errors when submitting transactions and sometimes up to 10 seconds of delay. Is there a issue with the sequencer?
undefined says anyone knows if the old arbitrum docs are accessible?
undefined says I wanted to learn what the old AVM compiled to. I know Nitro compiles to Go, but did the old AVM compiled directly to WASM? Or something else?
undefined says We will look into this asap.
undefined says lol
undefined says someone screwed up the kuberbetes config probably
undefined says something like that
undefined says Is there an easier way to calculate the `ticketId` on `redeem(bytes32 ticketId)` from the ArbRetryableTx precompile than https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/105bf73cb788231b6e63c510713f460b36699fcd/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L109-L155 ?
undefined says Hm, I think this is the easiest way, you can use our rpc by using npm or yarn to install @deleted-role/sdk
undefined says Is there a more difficult way? Or another way to calculate ticketId?
undefined says It was way easier using arb-ts
undefined says This method just how how to calculate it, you can also implement it use your style, pack them and hash them is key to calculate it.
undefined says What I meant by difficulty is the amount of variables needed to calculate it. I’m building a rather inmutable thing, so the lesser variables the better. Fewer failure points. The arb-ts method only needed one, if I recall correctly: the num thrown by createRetryableTicket
undefined says Is there by any chance a method to calculate ticketId that requests fewer variables?
undefined says May I ask why you want to get this id? Is it used for redeem the failed retryables? If so, you can create an instance and call its method: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/c-nitro-migration/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L505 , which will be much easier.
undefined says Saw that one, but you'd need the L1 receipt/tx-hash to call it, and my entry tx is called by the Gelato network so I have no access to that, unless I use their subgraph to query for it. 

So it's another layer of complexity added that I could avoid by generating the `ticketId` myself. 

I had this done already with arb-ts in a rather simple way, but the move to arb-sdk and this method with 10 more variables changed that :/
undefined says Is there another method to calculate the `ticketId` with less variables?
undefined says yo
undefined says hey devs i would like to ask why would a dev build defi apps on arbitrum one instead of arbitrum nova? how does arbitrum one suit defi apps better than nova which is supposedly better for gaming/social apps?
undefined says there isn't since we changed how `retryTxHash` is generated
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/d6df54cf4fed92903a03fc63e9525b046769fdf3/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md?plain=1#L50
undefined says what input do you have if its not the L1 hash?
undefined says The return value from `inbox.createRetryableTicket()` . In arb-ts there was a method that only needed that value to produce the ticketId needed for `redeem`
undefined says But yeah, this says it all.
undefined says Don't click on it, the link above is a scam.
undefined says i'm getting this issue too
undefined says Node was never restarted or anything
undefined says not sure how the db could have gotten corrupted...
undefined says Upgrading to the latest release of the docker image, in case that does anything this time
undefined says Will we get updated versions of the init snapshot too? It's taking a while to sync now, as time goes on.
undefined says The snapshot is 1 week old. We will update it but not weekly
undefined says kk
undefined says Why is the sequencer forced inclusion delay 24 hours instead of 1 or 2 batches?
undefined says To mitigate l2 reorgs/instability, there should be enough time delay.
undefined says Why does the gas limit change on transfers depending on the onchain activity?IS there any reason on why it isnt static like on eth mainnet (21000 Gas limit for transfers). Sometimes its 500k and sometimes it jumps up to close to 800k.
undefined says Also is there any way to calculate the gas limit needed for transfers at any given time?
undefined says how are transactions broadcasted from nodes to the sequencer when the eth_sendRawTransaction method is called? is it via raw tcp, websockets or http?
undefined says What is the risk of L2 reorgs? Is there a problem with saying "add the forced inclusion txs to the end of your next batch"? im fs missing something haha
undefined says In a rollup, you need to pay for data posted to L1, which is based on L1 gas price
That is reflected in the amount of gas used on L2 
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/faqs/how-fees
undefined says `eth_estimateGas`
undefined says The delay give flexibility to the sequencer so they can progress the chain faster. Otherwise, if a force included message is introduced in a L1 reorg L2 will also reorg. Since batch time is not fixed and sequencer may queue multiple batch during congestion or a gas spike, using number of batch as the requirement may not be a good idea.
undefined says Is cross chain messaging via arbitrum bridge feeless?
undefined says There are no extra fee except typical L1 fee, L2 fee and retryable ticket submission fee in case of a retryable ticket
undefined says By L1 and L2 fees you are not referring to gas fees right?
undefined says That’s gas fee
undefined says Okay so just to confirm, you only pay the gas fees for L1, L2 and a retryable ticket fee (if any) when doing cross chain messaging with the Arbitrum bridge?
undefined says correct
undefined says Okay thank you
undefined says Question: We don't have to do anything with our ETH on Arbitrum prior and after the Merge, right?
undefined says I think there is no change, arbitrum does not support forking. Your ETH on the arbitrum network will not change.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/faqs/the-merge
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says thanks
undefined says For clarification, the concern is that the L1 could go from
```
1. Batch n
2. Batch n+1
```
to
```
1. Batch n
2. Forced inclusion tx 1
3. Batch n+1
```
and then the state that was shown to users may be invalid?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Guud
undefined says Hi! I tried this but still has this error ```Error HH604: Error running JSON-RPC server: Unknown transaction type 106, set --fork-ignore-unknown-tx-type true to ignore```
undefined says This is the command i ran ```yarn hardhat node --fork https://... --fork-ignore-unknown-tx-type true```
undefined says 0x365883bed1a02E1824fE3A8bc46C71FcC2fCE463
undefined says working fine
undefined says released a new patch 2.10.2 should have fixed this
undefined says https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2995
undefined says So the team thinks a 24 hr reorg is possible? Can it be brought down to 6 mins post merge?
undefined says Also, does the same thing go for deposits? It can take up to 24 hours for a deposit to get into the L2 ledger?
undefined says 24 hours is a conservative worst case scenario, in most of the time the sequencer will include it after L1 confirmation
undefined says we might change it in the future after more careful research on its impact
undefined says looks like metamask showing correct gas amount now. well done team! love Arbitrum forever 💙
undefined says !lowfees
undefined says Currently Metamask and some other wallet providers are over-estimating gas fees by an insane amount. 

Swaps on Arbitrum are roughly equal to what you see here https://l2fees.info/ 

So when you actually send the transaction, you'll pay a TON less (no need to edit the gas estimation)
undefined says https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2995 Follow This my g
undefined says thanks working now!
undefined says amazing work
undefined says Sir Is arbitrum Nova Eth Listed in any Cex? Like any centralized exchange,,,,? sir🤗🌸
undefined says When is Odyssey back chaps? feeling horny for it.
undefined says You can use FTX
undefined says @djoney you can post that here
undefined says Sorry for missed channel @hunter | Offchain Labs, anyway, it seems that since Nitro we are unable to parse transactions with go-ethereum implementation? Is that a known problem? Also is there a way to go around it? We would really like to avoid using different sdk-s for L2 solutions. 
For example:
`eth_getBlockByNumber` is failing because of system transactions as go-ethereum is unable to parse them
undefined says I think there are some devastating consequences of this... Also, does the same thing go for deposits? It can take up to 24 hours for a deposit to get into the L2 ledger?
undefined says What errors do you meet?
undefined says 24 hours is the force inclusion needed. However, in most case, the sequencer will find your tx on delayed inbox and include it to sequencer inbox, so usually it won’t take so long, just about 5-10 minutes.
undefined says what will happen to my arbitrum eth after the merge?
undefined says No affect
undefined says my 1eth on arbitrum= 1 eth on pos after the merge right?
undefined says Correct
undefined says Thanks for the information
undefined says agreed, but would be good to have it be invalid to wait for too long, although i see the concern. is the 24 hour delay also on deposits? deposits are just a different type of forced inclusion, no?
undefined says It won’t affect deposit as sequencer is alive, as I said, if sequencer process your message, it only takes 5-10 minutes.
undefined says Force inclusion will only be used when sequencer is not alive (but almost in the all case it won’t happen), users can force include their message from delayed inbox to sequencer inbox.
undefined says Sir may I ask you a question if you allow,?
undefined says Of course
undefined says i have been trying to bridge eth to nova from etherium for 2 days , but my transaction is
stuck
undefined says Could you dm me your transaction hash? I will check it for you
undefined says 🤔
undefined says it dint go through
undefined says Just make a friend request, if you don’t mind, you can also send your tx hash here.
undefined says more then 5 4 hours now
undefined says Are you depositing from the mainnet to the nova network?
undefined says Any idea on when the upgrade system of the smart contracts will introduce a delay? Also the 4 of 6 multisig could be expanded to a larger pool of keys?
undefined says 0xd3f1Da62CAFB7E7BC6531FF1ceF6F414291F03D3
undefined says Its just unable to parse system transactions and then returns "transaction type not supported"
undefined says Hardhat drops error for unknown typed txs which we rely on in Nitro.
You can bypass this error flag using this guide:

https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2995
undefined says I recall that before Nitro, the sequencer would rejects a tx if the tx's gas limit exceeded some dynamic threshold. I remember there was an API for querying this threshold, but don't remember what the API endpoint is. Is there still such a threshold in Nitro? I imagine that a tx can't have a gas limit more than 1,125,899,906,842,624 gas, the block gas limit. But is there a lower threshold?

undefined says gotcha, totally agree that this is fine in an honest sequencer case 🙂 mainly thinking about worst case scenario, can a deposit take 24 hours to show up on L2?
undefined says Will arbitrum eth get pos eth!
undefined says ?
undefined says 💙🤗
undefined says It perhaps
undefined says Arbitrum will keep alive on eth pos.
undefined says Hi! i'm trying to run a node, and am getting this error, grateful for any hints:

undefined says Check your l1 rpc
undefined says thank you
undefined says Will my arbitrum eth get an airdrop too?
undefined says If ethereum fork, the arbitrum on ethereum will also be forked to ethw, so you can claim there.
undefined says What website do i claim the ethw on?
undefined says Perhaps you should claim it on ethw’s blockchain explorer.
undefined says After the merge i go to the BE and write on the contract to claim thr ethw?
undefined says might I ask why there are two pending transaction from L1 to L2 here: https://arbiscan.io/txsDeposits
undefined says thanks
undefined says This tx might redeem failed, failed reason might be the gas is not enough
undefined says thanks, it seems the last transactions is 13 days ago? I am new and still learn
undefined says If auto-redeem failed, it won’t auto-redeem, but only other claim it manually, also, the retryables ticket will expire in 7 days.
undefined says appreciate that
undefined says Yea, but this is not for hardhat, I'm talking about go-ethereum client when implementing apps in golang. We are trying to avoid using different go clients for each network basically
undefined says Hope this can help you: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/1016574168130662522
undefined says Sure, but then with any other L2 introducing new types it would be a problem also, would be nice to create some fork supporting all types for all rollups and mainnet
undefined says is there a document with the different tx types possible on arbitrum? I have encountered 100, 104 and 106
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/141b0fcdf0e4d8e9e5de3f0466533b86563f2d29/core/types/transaction.go#L48-L54
undefined says awesome! thanks a lot
undefined says n/p!
undefined says How many sequencers, validators and nodes are on the Arbitrum main net? Thank you! 🙂
undefined says are there any resources for building nitro from the git repo? I'm trying to build the node using the dockerfile in the repo but am getting this error on the first part of the docker build 
```Step 6/156 : RUN cd emsdk && . ./emsdk_env.sh && cd .. && ./build-brotli.sh -w -t install/

undefined says You can try `git submodule update --init --recursive` before the docker build and see if it works
undefined says How quickly after the merge will Arbitrum switch from waiting 20 blocks to waiting for epoch finalization to propagate a msg from L1 to L2?
undefined says The merge is smooth, so I don’t think there would be any huge changes after merge for arbitrum
undefined says What is the full system requirement? Having trouble running it on my raspi and laptop
undefined says ~~is there a link to the most recent docs version ? For example the following section https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#l2-to-l1-ticket-based-calls was more detailed in the previous version iirc. Ultimately, I'm looking for a bit more detail on the step by step for L2 to L1 messaging.~~

ah found it here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/L1_L2_Messages.md nvm
undefined says another question, for settling back to L1 following a previous L1 to L2 contract interaction via a retryable ticket, what would be the recommended method to settle back ? Would we send another retryable ticket with a call to `ArbSys.sendTxToL1()` along with the associated calldata? Would another option would be to deploy an L2 contract where we could then call `ArbSys.sendTxToL1()`?
undefined says Retryables are only used for L1-L2 msgs. To send an L2-L1 message you need to make a call to L2 ArbSys precompile contract's sendTxToL1 method. This can be either a direct call or through an L2 contract
undefined says This piece of code is part of our tutorials that shows you how to call ArbSys.sendTxToL1() from an L2 contract: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/redeem-failed-retryable/contracts/arbitrum/GreeterL2.sol
undefined says cool thanks!
undefined says I'm getting quite often the error `Timed out waiting to retrieve retryable creation receipt` when waiting for the status on the message for manually redeeming a retryable ticket, both in goerli and rinkeby. Is that normal?
undefined says This is the full error from the sdk:
```js
Error: Timed out waiting to retrieve retryable creation receipt: 0x07f47e11beedffcd6acaae1c6b38b4854a74bece45d7f666888ad23b12bc5007.

    at redeemHash (/Users/zzzz/Documents/zzzz/myDapps/paymentDapp/scripts/event-listener.js:135:19)
```
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says This might be because an attempt was made to create the retryable ticket, but it failed (it could be due to not enough submission cost being paid by the L1 transaction). You could use L1ToL2MessageStatus in the SDK to see what is the status of your retryable.
This snippet from our tutorial shows you how to do that:

undefined says 1. You need to have eth/usdt or usdc in your on the Arbitrum network (you can swap on Uniswap)
2. Go to the website Hop. exchange ==> select Pool==> Select the network Arbitrum and usdt, usdc or eth you want to add liquidity
3. Enter the amount of eth, usdc, or usdt you want to add liquidity (minimum 0.01) ==> Add liquidity

undefined says I can only get `gasUsedForL1` from receipt, how to calculate L1 cost according to this?
undefined says just use `gasUsedForL1` to multiply `effectiveGasPrice`
undefined says How to reduce L1 gas? Is reducing input data the only way? Because only input data will be stored in L1. @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Yes, you can try to reduce that data, but after nitro, we also introduce a compression method to help reducing the data, and it is automatically, you don’t need do anything.
undefined says Is price different between L2 computation gas and L1 stored gas? I want to know whether it's worthwhile to use more L2 gas to reduce L1 gas. @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says price is same

undefined says Good morning! I am looking for docs on the sequencer feed: I managed to subscribe to it, but would like to understand/decode the content of the messages. Thanks in advance!
undefined says Hi, this is an example: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/994890535955337236 , however, this is for classic version, after nitro, we use brotli compression algorithm, you should use it to depress it first.
undefined says Alright so I use brotli to decompress and then use the instructions up there to decode. Thanks Jason, have a good day.
undefined says Just a simple complement: given the following sequencer message, only the L2Msg field should be decompressed right ? (Just discovered brotli, having touble to decompress it ^^)

undefined says i was wondering if someone can assist with my question. i'm trying to use the arbiscan api to get the balance from an account but it keeps returning zero even though there are balances on tokens for that account. this is the api I'm trying to use. is there a different value of the "tag" parameter I need to send to get the unverified state balance for the account. would really appreciate any assistance I get on this.

undefined says Ah, I don’t think we have a secondary sequencer feed url.
undefined says May I ask if your project listed on our portal?
undefined says any estimate for when the next chain snapshot will be uploaded?
undefined says Currently we don’t have a timeline, but for now, if you just sync from nitro genesis, it should be fast
undefined says yes it syncs in a few hours which isnt bad. i am trying to streamline this process on my end by making copies of the chain data (.arbitrum directory) on a fully synced node and distributing it to my new nodes. although when i mount the copied data into the new node's docker container i see this message ```2022-09-20T05:18:07.741501443Z INFO [09-20|05:18:07.741] Loaded most recent local header          number=25,397,810 hash=0576d1..68bc32 td=3,189,994 age=9m18s

undefined says is the "head state missing, repairing" message temporary? or is there a special way to start a new node with a pre-existing .arbitrum directory? i just omitted the `--init.url` parameter on startup
undefined says Seems your database got crashed
undefined says What version did you use for the origin node?
undefined says `nitro-node:v2.0.5-208d9d5`
undefined says that was the message the new node immediately printed on startup when initialized with the pre-existing .arbitrum directory
undefined says Next time you can gracefully shutdown: Next time you stop the node should use graceful shutdown by docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
undefined says i never stopped any node though, i just copied the data from an already running node and tried to bootstrap a new one from the data
undefined says was hoping to bypass most of the syncing process
undefined says or are you saying i need to gracefully shutdown the running node in order to properly duplicate the data?
undefined says Ah, you should shutdown your node first, because your db is keeping writing
undefined says Yup, gracefully shutdown and then copy it again.
undefined says Many thanks @gzeon | Offchain Labs

undefined says hey noticed the contracts on the arbiscan isnt updated and data available only till june
https://arbiscan.io/chart/verified-contracts
undefined says do u know how we can get in touch with etherscan team to get the data?
undefined says hey! is there anyone here who can help me understand the flow for bridging to arb programatically?
undefined says Hey,
But I can see contracts verified today:
https://arbiscan.io/contractsVerified
undefined says Hey you can find info here:

undefined says Thanks, I'll give this a read. If there's anything I'm not 100% on maybe you can help clear it up?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/chart/verified-contracts meant this one. The verified link u shared only allows us to view 500 ones, and hence the historical ones are missing :(
undefined says Sure ask it here! we'll help
undefined says ok I have one now
undefined says so I'm trying to do this in the most basic way first
undefined says But I can see in the chart
undefined says 
undefined says I issued `delayedInbox -> write as proxy -> depositEth` with `payableAmount=.005`
undefined says the tx went through and the eth is no longer in the mainnet wallet
undefined says https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0d76038548b9523b5e1112d497f67e47b1ac2d343da307d67ba5b1e1fb7c5db8
undefined says but according to the docs, this should have resulted in the funds automatically getting added to my arb walled by the same addr I  think?
undefined says But it's only until June ser, need for months from there till Sept
undefined says scratch that
undefined says but what contract call can withdraw or transfer the funds from the bridge to my arb wallet?
undefined says Oh I see it shows Sep but it's June!
I'll discuss it with etherscan team. Thanks for the report

undefined says lmao nice
undefined says sorry it was so simple I was suspicious and almost certain I did it wrong
undefined says fantastic, thanks!
undefined says haha Np!
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs hey sorry to bug you again, just trying to code this and having slight issues. Using this contract on etherscan `https://etherscan.io/address/0x4Dbd4fc535Ac27206064B68FfCf827b0A60BAB3f#writeProxyContract` which has a section called "Write as Proxy". Do you know what must be done to handle this type of transaction in ethers?
undefined says You can call them like calling any contract on Ethereum. 
Also we have an sdk which makes it simpler.
We have tutorials that may help you:

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says I get error when deploying ‘Unpredictable gas limit’.
What am I doing wrong? What is the gasPrice and gasLinit for the hardhat config
undefined says Hold on, let me check
undefined says You can check if your address has enough ether, and check if there is a require statement in your target contract which will revert your tx.
undefined says I thought I'd solved this issue by multiplying the submission cost by 100, but it came back again, and it's an on/off behavior. 

I have an array of tx hashes which were created using the same params, and there are some that are checked out without issues, using this snippet from the sdk, but others fail with this error
undefined says The line where they get stuck is 
```js
const status = (await message.waitForStatus()).status;
```
undefined says I've tried querying the status of the troubling hashes separately but they always get stuck in that line before throwing `Timed out waiting to retrieve retryable creation receipt`
undefined says How I'm getting the submission cost:
```js
const l1ToL2MessageGasEstimate = new L1ToL2MessageGasEstimator(l2ProviderTestnet);
   
    const _submissionPriceWei = await l1ToL2MessageGasEstimate.estimateSubmissionFee(
        l1ProviderTestnet,
        await l1ProviderTestnet.getGasPrice(),
        sendToArbBytesLength
    );

    let submissionPriceWei = _submissionPriceWei.mul(5);
    submissionPriceWei = ethers.BigNumber.from(submissionPriceWei).mul(100);
```
undefined says And I'm purposely failing the auto-redemption of the retryable as you guys have it on the tutorial:
```js
const maxGas = !manualRedeem ? 3000000 : 10;
```
undefined says The issue is for manual redeeming
undefined says Hey will look into it
undefined says If it is of any help, I tried another round right now by just clicking enter (without changing anything), and it went through this time in one of hashes where it had gotten stuck before...so no sure what's causing the on/off
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I'm not sure but I think it's finality problem on the Goerli, Rinkeby after merge
undefined says That makes sense
undefined says How long will it take you to have `Timed out waiting to retrieve retryable creation receip`t error?
undefined says I was working on rinkeby to spend all the eth i got there, but it was so buggy that i moved to goerli
undefined says quite some time...around 10-15 mins
undefined says Oh I see! Then I think that's the issue. The problem is on Goerli/Rinkeby chain sometimes not enough voter, vote on time to make block finalized
undefined says and it may take like 30 minutes
undefined says And also right now we have "finalized" assumption for finality on L1
undefined says I'll make a push to increase timeout to cover these situations.
undefined says Awesome!
undefined says Thanks a lot for the info and the help
undefined says Np! Ah another question, which sdk are you using?
undefined says I mean which version?
undefined says "@arbitrum/sdk": "^2.0.18",
undefined says Do u know when it will get resolved by, trying to make a arbitrum hype thread so badly want this data
undefined says Actually seems like it's not their priority! I put a note to our shared doc!
undefined says howdy! I got some help yesterday bridging eth from mainnet to arb via ethers js contract calls
undefined says My req changed and now I need to bridge an ERC20 token, I remember reading that I can use the depositEth function for this, but I'm having a bit of trouble working it out
undefined says ok that last thing I said might be wrong
undefined says You can see this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/PoW-Fork/packages/token-deposit , depositEth method won’t work for erc20 deposit
undefined says Good morning
undefined says Can someone explain why Arbitrum One writes to Sequencer Inbox every few minutes, but Arbitrum Nova only every 30 mins?
undefined says Hi, arbitrum nova uses anytrust tech, and da is stored by dac, and sequencer will only post the DACert proving availability of the data to sequencer inbox, so we don’t need to push the data so frequently, here is the docs about anytrust: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/inside-anytrust.md
undefined says So the higher trust assumptions of anytrust make it possible to work with even lower fees. Thank you for the hint!
undefined says Np!
undefined says Hey guys, I'm looking to run an arbitrum nitro node, but I don't see any parameter to specify an address to receive any potential rewards?
undefined says for example is something like this --suggested-fee-recipient on the beacon chain nodes
undefined says Nitro is just a technology. For node content you can check https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-classic-node
undefined says There should be no information about any rewards at the moment
undefined says thanks. It looks similar to the "Running a node" section. But I'm a bit confused now, I'm interested in running a node that processes the uniswap transactions. Do I need nitro or the classic one?
undefined says Sorry just to clarify I'm interested in arbitrum one
undefined says This is the classic node. Nitro is :
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says what do you mean by processing uniswap transactions? Do you mean analyzing them?
undefined says yes, correct, well and connecting in general to the blockchain using web3 python, instead of using one of those providers like infura that limit number of transactions
undefined says What are the recommended ways of achieving on chain randomness in arbitrum? I saw that chain link vrf doesn’t support arbitrum yet
undefined says depends on your usecase, some options are `blockhash(block.number-1)` 
`ArbSys.arbBlockHash(arbBlockNum-1)`
or you can pass the PREVRANDAO / VRF from L1 using a L1 to L2 message
undefined says I think treasure also have a randomizer contract https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8e79c8607a28fe1ec3527991c89f1d9e36d1bad9
undefined says any devs around who can help me with programmatically calling the arbitrum bridge L1GatewayRouter outboundTransfer function? I'm having trouble bridging an erc20 token from mainnet to a different OP wallet. I've gotten through a good amount of my issues but now I'm getting this error when simulating on tenderly
undefined says I'm not sure where `extraData` is supposed to be coming from or why the value of mine is `null`. any help would be greatly appreciated. I can share more specifics if/when anyone reaches out to help 🙂
undefined says are there any examples of how to use this?
undefined says Hoping to learn more about the incentives you guys are offering to teams to build on Arbitrum!
undefined says k9
undefined says If we have an Arbitrum native ERC-20, is it possible to send that to Layer 1 and are there any security risks in doing so?
undefined says Your l2 native token should implement IArbToken (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol), and l1 token implement this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/ICustomToken.sol , then register to our gateway, for more details, you can see: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging
undefined says Hi, that extraData comes from data, you can see here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/90a1ebade09f87d2edd35188d11ec8367585b36d/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1ArbitrumGateway.sol#L261, and dig into that function: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/90a1ebade09f87d2edd35188d11ec8367585b36d/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/gateway/GatewayMessageHandler.sol#L72
undefined says Also it might be your _data: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/90a1ebade09f87d2edd35188d11ec8367585b36d/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1ArbitrumGateway.sol#L264
undefined says hey yeah I found that. realized my initial call doesn’t have any output. it’s bo longer failing because data + gas*gasBid don’t equal value so i’ve got that worked out but now there’s just no output =\
undefined says Thank you! Are there any risks of bridging to zkRollups from this? (Native arbitrum ERC20 > Layer 1 > zksync for example?)
undefined says If you want to bridge to zkRollups, you should see their docs, I am not sure about this.
undefined says So does it work now? Or you don’t see your token on l2?
undefined says 1 sec
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  so on tenderly I can get the transaction to go through if I use the same exact gas values and data as a real tx i did
undefined says I'll read the stuff you sent and get back to you
undefined says Here is a test case which will call that function: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/0ec9e60afbfaa5b9821679fe2aa3e794d480356a/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/test/gatewayRouter.l1.ts#L147
undefined says thanks, I'm shot, I'll give this all a read in the morning. appreciate the assistance
undefined says np
undefined says Ok thanks!
undefined says Thanks for your correction and sharing :arbitrum:
undefined says Hey there, got a question on this wallet, is this an EOA? How come there's no transfer in but was able to transfer out thousands of ETH? No internal txs either https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb799bc5e676325cc5fc891ac48fe442f6298b543
undefined says Hi, this is a eth deposit transaction, you see this address is because it is an alias address, you can find more details here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
undefined says I see so does it mean this is the original address? what's the purpose of aliasing? https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa688bc5e676325cc5fc891ac48fe442f6298a432
undefined says This is because if we don’t alias the sender address, if there are 2 contracts on l1 and l2 shares the same address, the contract on l1 can send cross layer transaction to contract that l2 address’ funds
undefined says Got it, makes sense thanks!
undefined says what's the best tool to analyse gas usage on arbitrum?
undefined says Yo
undefined says Is there any rng oracles on nova?
undefined says Do you need code analysis or statistical tools
undefined says code analysis I guess
undefined says This might be able to help you
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas
undefined says ok thx this did help, so if I understand it correctly the amount of gas required for a arbitrum transaction changes based on the L1 gas price? that would explain why some of my tx suddendly used way more gas although they do the sameish thing
undefined says Yes, the gas of arbitrum fluctuates with L1. Arbitrum's rollup should be submitted to L1 for verification
undefined says Is this also why on the internal txns tab on arbiscan the gas limit left on the first call is sometimes way lower? so the buffer gas gets substracted first?

here are 2 txs that have the same gas limit but one has way less leftover before the first call

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdea93fe9577e06104c67b13a3c7f80112a137e187c39e0e8f50a21c8dfd3f6d3
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x685cf14286ed33dffe27912fba8634f0ddc89ad53343969e4eeb67a3ddf915a9
undefined says It also depends on what type of transaction you are. If it is a deposit, it will be much higher than the transferred Gas
undefined says I think if you are going to compare the Gas of two transactions tx, it is better to have the Gas of the same transaction
undefined says what do you mean - those 2 tx call the same function... just at different times. so I am wondering if the huge difference in gas usage is because of the L1 buffer fee - and as I said looking at the first internal tx the gas used before the first call is vastly different on those 2. but in the contract itself nothing much happens before that - so as I said - is this the buffer fee that makes the difference?
undefined says is it possible to run an arbitrum full node? have a dapp i need to be able to update chain state quickly
should i just run a forwarder node for this?
undefined says Sorry, I don't quite understand what your buffer fee means
undefined says You may have to wait for a team member to answer this question.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says see here
https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

"calling Arbitrum’s estimate gas RPC gives a value that represents the ArbGas used for L2 computation plus an additional buffer (B) such that P*G ends up being sufficient to cover the full transaction cost. "
undefined says thanks for letting me know 👍
undefined says Yeah that’s L1 cost which we apply it on the amount of gas you’re paying
undefined says The amount of gas you’re paying depends on:
1. L2 gas needed for tx (which is fixed for a specific tx)
2. L1 base fee
3. Calldata size and how compressible it is based on brotli algo
4. L2 gas price
undefined says Can you confirm that (part of) the difference in gas spent before the first call in the internal transactions view of a tx is based on the l1 Gas price? (Assuming the same function called on a contract)
undefined says Yeah that's correct
undefined says Thanks
undefined says I'm still struggling with some stuff on the arb bridge call. Would there be any way to have a call with someone on the support team to show what I'm trying to do and get some feedback on what I'm doing, why it's failing and how I can fix? I read the docs you guys have shared but I'm pretty new to blockchain development so I have not been able to debug from what I ready in the docs
undefined says is it possible to pull a linux binary to run an arbitrum node? seeing docker images only so far
undefined says trying to build from source, getting ```[ 79%] Linking CXX executable ../bin/arbcore_runner

undefined says you can ask here
undefined says I GOT IT!
undefined says I figured it al lout just in time for the wekeend
undefined says 😉
undefined says the arbitrum repo is for the deprecated classic stack, please see https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro
undefined says also, though my code works, I fear for its future
undefined says I don't understand the second and third fields in the data parameter of my call
undefined says they seem to consistently be uint 64 and uint 0 in every [recent] call to this contract
undefined says I hope it doesn't change one day lol
undefined says also you arbitrum support guys are pretty on the ball! I really do appreciate all your responses and help!
undefined says bro what should i build
undefined says give me some ideas and i’ll send you my girl’s nudes in exchange
undefined says @Big Ben (will Never DM you) can you explain for him?
undefined says I didn’t mention in that message that it’s the L1 gateway router outboundTransferCustomRefund data parameter that i’m confused about
undefined says anyone have instructions to build nitro from source to get a node running?
undefined says `make build` fails on:
```~/nitro$ cd arbitrator && cbindgen --config cbindgen.toml --crate prover --output ../target/include/arbitrator.h
ERROR: Couldn't load manifest file "/home/ubuntu/nitro/arbitrator/Cargo.toml": Toml(Error { inner: ErrorInner { kind: Custom, line: Some(6), col: 0, at: Some(60), message: "missing field `package`", key: [] } })
ERROR: Couldn't generate bindings for /home/ubuntu/nitro/arbitrator.```
undefined says The data field should abi encode (uint maxSubmissionCost, bytes)
undefined says usually that should be an empty bytes, which is the 64 (offset) and 0 (length) you got
undefined says beautiful
undefined says so this shouldn’t change at any point, right?
undefined says Yes
undefined says thanks for following up!
undefined says I understand that Arbitrum One and other L2s post all their calldata to the L1. Does that mean that deploying an instance of Arbitrum on Arbitrum One would be pointless because all the call data would need to end up on the L1 regardless?
undefined says Hi, although the data will post to l1, but the data for l2 to l1 is by calldata way, which will be much cheaper for developing directly on l1 by state data way.
undefined says An argument for L3 would that L2 resources (e.g. storage, computation) will eventually exhaust
undefined says Just stopping by to let you know that we are really appreciating the easy setup of a nitro node (especially in a containerized environment). No other L2 project seems to get this done...
undefined says Thanks for your support!
undefined says when i connect wallet,it suggests this error. What do i do?0x1bEa1efeEF96Af36CF034c96855cBbb19F5564DE
undefined says Which wallet are you using?
undefined says If you’re using MetaMask then you can just try and access your dapp live dashboard
undefined says could someone please point me to the primary L1 <> arbitrum one bridge contracts?
undefined says Ah found it, it's this guy `0x8315177aB297bA92A06054cE80a67Ed4DBd7ed3a`
undefined says You can find complete list here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses
undefined says Ah excellent. I got lost in the docs and couldn’t find this page 🤣
undefined says helped me also, how did you find out if i may ask ser ? is there an easy way to figure out the frontend from a smart contract ?
undefined says Maybe you can see that contract’s comments or name, I can see Odos from that contract
undefined says Guys is there anyway to use the l2 to l1 messaging methods for read only calls
undefined says Or will the call still need to wait for the proof to be posted to return the value?
undefined says Im trying to get total supply of an erc20 from mainnet
undefined says Back to nova
undefined says Any help would be greatly appreciate
undefined says I can use layerzero messaging relayer but id really prefer to use arbitrum infrastructure
undefined says I dont want to rely on a third party to pass the information back
undefined says You can push the value from L1 without delay using a L1 to L2 message
undefined says Thanks bro but I need the request to originate on the L2
undefined says If you need your tx originate from l2, you can set up an oracle to make this. L2 calls to oracle, and oracle helps call l1, then l1 send call to l2.
undefined says I use the Gnosis safe wallet.Sometimes it works, sometimes it suggests the error.Now,i can access the Bungee Bridges.
arb1:0xC814c2480Ed309a7cD7E6D7c1A3a7df14293c2ca
undefined says Oh, gnosis safe is smart contract address, you should use EOA address to use our bridge
undefined says Thanks bro.👍
undefined says Pls i cant bridge i have been getting this error message since yesterday and i have the right quantity to bridge
undefined says Off chain?
undefined says Yup, because if you use our official bridge, your tx from l2->l1 will need challenge period
undefined says Maybe your token on nova but you are using one?
undefined says Dang, is there an onchain way around it if I just want to return a value from l1 to l2 originating on l2?
undefined says Hmm, might only wait the challenge period.
undefined says My token is on one
undefined says I could use layerzero relayer
undefined says But its essentially doing what you suggested anyway
undefined says Off chain oracle
undefined says Ah, so you want to move token from l1 to l2? You should change your wallet’s network to l1 first
undefined says Im moving from l2 to l1
undefined says But it seems you don’t have token on l2, maybe you can check your token on block explorer, which l2 do you want to move from? One or nova?
undefined says You can also use 3rd part bridge which will provide you a fast withdraw
undefined says I have my token on l1, i am moving fron arbitrum one. It seems one bridge has prob sync user input with wallet balance
undefined says I have but the token isnt supported on most bridges for now.
undefined says Do you have ethers on l2?
undefined says Yes i do
undefined says Could you send me your address? Dm me if you want to keep private
undefined says Sure request sent your dm is locked
undefined says Now you can send dm
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs you are a good man, good support ty
undefined says Np, happy to help
undefined says Thanks fren the bridge has worked
undefined says question about  GasLimit，what is the gasLimit for transaction in arbitrum ?
undefined says somebody
undefined says You mean gas limit for a block?
undefined says You can call this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L80
undefined says Hey guys I'm relatively new to dev world and need all the help anyone can give. 

I'm trying to build a discord bot that tracks/report a treasury wallet.

Anyone know of what free api to use or how i can effectively build a bot that monitors a wallet balance on Arbitrum network?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/getting-started-devs
undefined says You can check out the full dev tutorial first
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs sorry to be a pest
undefined says I've tried a few methods to fix this
undefined says https://goerli-rollup-explorer.arbitrum.io/tx/0xf27a0ab9e44eefd37d2a1fb60ad1dd9fe9f119285ccc819d6c7d5bbf8b1567f6
undefined says Im sending data from l1 to l2, and I keep coming up with this error.
undefined says As far as I can see, the handoff is fine but the error on the contract may be call data related? Perhaps how it has been packed
undefined says Do you have any insights you could share? My next step was to reduce the called function to something very basic like a counter to see if  there's an issue with the amount of params im calling on the l2
undefined says (Handing off 2 addresses a uint to update a mapping currently)
undefined says need some help testing and auditing if anyone wants to take a poke

undefined says Hello!
Is Arbitrum's Sequencer open source?
I did not find its source on github.
Cheers!
undefined says Hello!
undefined says Hi, can you try call 0xde870846 from l2 side? It might be a contract inner check error.
undefined says It’s in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/
undefined says Sorry if this is answered elsewhere - 
How does the bridge _work_?  Are there docs explaining it?

Is it a "mint and burn" with wrapped assets, or is there something else going on?
undefined says https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/
undefined says You should read this document if this is the first time you use Bridge Arbitrum. You can read more about the project on the media and docs of the project here #🔗︱links
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/asset-bridging
undefined says Does arbitrum has the same contract size limit?
undefined says hello!
undefined says Yup
undefined says 24k as l1
undefined says #💻︱protocol
undefined says #💻︱protocol
undefined says Hi! The link is broken... 😔
undefined says I found it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/sequencer.go
undefined says Does changing gas fee on metamask help or not?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs - is there a l1 to l2 messaging service for nova?
undefined says gn
undefined says #☕︱gm
undefined says I'm thinking whether we can increase the contract size for Aribitrum. Theoretically, Aribitrum offer more blocks in a period of time then L1. In total there are more block space for Arbitrum in a period of time, so I think it makes sense to increase the contract size.
undefined says Contract size is really a problem when building more complex application.
undefined says Cool
undefined says arbitrum on fire
undefined says Hmmm
undefined says If you’re trying to speed up the transaction it is.
undefined says what does it mean for an l2 to reorg exactly?  Also, in general, how often does the sequencer post batches to L1?
undefined says .
undefined says what if you choose slow? do you save money?
undefined says Yes bruhhhhh
undefined says Obviouslyyy
undefined says L2s are already re organizing?
undefined says hmmm i dont think so, everytime I switch to low, it ends up being standard anyway
undefined says WDYM? In my understanding, the sequencer submits batches to L1, and they get finality when the L1 block gets finality.  So what does an "L2 reorg" mean?  Aren't there just L1 reorgs which would have an effect on the L2.  I have lots of gaps in my understanding, looking to fill them 🙏
undefined says Arbitrum Fans
undefined says hey guys, what is the current block difficulty of the arbiturm chain ?
undefined says or did it change from 2500000000000.. ?
undefined says Guys, I'm having problem testing code via hardhat.
This config file only doesn't work at Arbitrum. If I replace Arbitrum node to Polygon node, it works fine.
Can anyone help me how I should make config file at Arbitrum?
undefined says are u trying to run it locally ?
undefined says yes i think Is this
undefined says Yes, npx hardhat test doesn't work
undefined says mind sharing ur package.json ?
undefined says https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2995
Solved the problem using this! Thanks bro
undefined says do you know the max gaz limit of a block ?
undefined says check this md: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/Inside_Arbitrum.md
undefined says Hi! I am also interested on what an "L2 reorg" mean. Can anyone provide some directions where I can get more info about it?
undefined says a
undefined says I am testing nitro local network using test-node.bash
undefined says but i met errors below
```
nitro-validator-1  | panic: no contract code at given address
...
nitro-poster-1     | panic: signature verification is enabled but no key is present
```

how do i solve this error?
undefined says Hey use this:
`./test-node.bash --init`
undefined says How can I follow the amount of gas available in the gas pool ?
undefined says still i am meeting same error T_T
undefined says i solve this problem.
i refer to this link : https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1191
undefined says hey dev gang, im getting my head around the protocol, is this the exhaustive list of protocol contracts on mainnet? https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/arbitrum?subcatid=undefined&size=100&start=0&col=3&order=desc
undefined says I have a question with regards to the "gas price bid"  and "gas price paid": is this information included somewhere in the tx itself? how can one bid higher on arbitrum?
undefined says and why is it so that when bidding say 1 GWEI as gas price, you then only pay 0.1 GWEI
undefined says for example, see: https://arbiscan.io/txs?block=28491549
undefined says tx: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xfa7c1e992140be881db4e2445daf49281162391a06916d5dafc7c46126fb4b15
undefined says do you always just pay 0.1 GWEI regardless of how much you bid?
undefined says arbiscan is down !
undefined says /behind
undefined says its latest block is: 28505967
undefined says looks like they're indexing again
undefined says slowly getting up to speed again 👍
undefined says You can find them here:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/useful-addresses
undefined says what do you mean by transaction? you mean tx when signing via wallets like MM? Or querying transaction using RPC call?
undefined says starting up nitro in archive mode, initial db seems to be getting redownloaded
undefined says progress was 5% some time ago, but is 3% now
undefined says does arbitrum have block gas limit ? or put it in another way, can I write unbound loop ? this is not possible for ethereum mainnet as it can only go to certain size depending on what is done in the loop
undefined says anyone can tell whats wrong?
undefined says ```
attempt 45 failed: write /t
```
hmmm...
undefined says We have speed limit concept here :
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-speed-limit
Also for each transaction/Arb block we have limitations of 7 million gas limit for L2 part of the fee.
Note that gas in Arbitrum is two dimentional and have two parts (L2 and L1 calldata part) more info can be find here : https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas
undefined says so there is a gas limit of 7M for each transaction ? or that I still cannot do unbound loop, even if 'cost' is not an issue ?
undefined says i will just leave it here that errors should use a new line and not continue updating the same line with carriage returns, i only caught this after 45 attempts because i wasnt looking at the logs all the time
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1220
undefined says personally I really hate those formatting code etc. only used in the 80s 🙂
undefined says yeah feeling really stupid not having been able to see the error that i could've tried to fix 6 hours ago, could've spent this time syncing
undefined says anyone got a recent nitro snapshot?
undefined says thanks! in Web3.py model, I found the "Gas Price Paid" field via... ```receipt = self.arbitrum_w3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(<txn_hash>)
receipt['effectiveGasPrice'] --> https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html (or code equivalent)```
undefined says i was just looking at a transaction on arbiscan, see attached: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xfa7c1e992140be881db4e2445daf49281162391a06916d5dafc7c46126fb4b15
undefined says that transaction has a gas price "bid" and a gas price "paid"
undefined says not sure what to make of that or where to read more about this
undefined says does this gas price bid impact ordering of the tx's in the block?
undefined says anyone can become block validator?
undefined says Hey, 
Gas price bid is the maximum amount that you agreed to pay for a transaction. Gas price paid is the final amount you're paying.
undefined says Transactions in Arbitrum is in First Come First Serve manner. So we won't charge users for Priority fee. The only thing that you're paying is base fee of the block. So gas price paid is the block base fee.
undefined says You can pay priority fee in your tx, but we won't collect it and you'll be refunded for the surplus.
undefined says Base fee will change based on network congestion. Please read this for more info on how fees are on Arbitrum and how block base fee may change:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#fees
undefined says Right now we have whitelisted validator but we have plan to move to more distributed/decentralized schemes for validator soon
undefined says hey
undefined says when this plan will be execute?
undefined says I'm writing some fork tests for a bridge I'm working on.

I was able to successfully test a message from L1 to L2 in this file: https://github.com/pooltogether/ERC5164/blob/c7346a3a646a923d6d92a724f38bbce0475ba257/script/fork/bridge/BridgeToArbitrum.ts#L23
Now I want to test the execution of this message on L2. Since it's a fork, I will need to impersonate the contract executing the message on L2.
Which contract is this? Is this the one at address 0: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ?
Then do I need to retrieve the transaction hash and pass it to the redeem function of the ArbRetryableTx contract to execute it?
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x3d552e431702ca89cae11d2ed6eb54990971e2844d4eb0bc3ce310c78eb96a0d

Thanks in advance for your help.
undefined says currently, every arbitrum validator is operated by offchain lab?

how many arbitrum validator exists?

My script works without any problem when running fork tests but not when running it on the Goerli testnets.
undefined says i keep getting the following error when trying to build nitro, any ideas what the issue could be?
```

undefined says this is my node log. has syn 10days,is this normal?
undefined says how long will cost start with height 0 ?

undefined says ??
undefined says what bro
undefined says Hello! On the upgrade you did on the `sdk` from 2.0.18/19 to 3.0.0 the `l1Receipt.getL1ToL2Message` method doesn't exist anymore, so the tutorial on how to manually redeem a retryable ticket can't be completed (last pushed commit was `updating sdk to 2.0.18`).

Would you have an updated tutorial or the method to get `message` in order to call `redeem()`?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/redeem-failed-retryable/scripts/exec-redeem.js#L33
undefined says 
undefined says Hi, we are doing this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/pull/79
undefined says What is the version of your node?
undefined says Eth deposit from l1 official bridge won’t cost gas .
undefined says You can see how docker build the nitro, and refer to it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says Hi, we have a tutorial on this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter , and your tx will auto redeem on l2 first, but if it fails (may due to your gas not enough or execution revert), you can redeem it, and you can see how to redeem it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/redeem-failed-retryable
undefined says Our sdk supports goerli, what is your sdk version?
undefined says 
undefined says why syn after 700 million height， then syn very slowly?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Are you syncing the mainnet or testnet?
undefined says i see, thanks @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs !
undefined says Can we see tracing of transactions in Arbitrum? I know that the AVM is quite different from the EVM, that's why am asking
undefined says did nitro not add tracing api?
undefined says why doesn't subgraph call handlers still not work?
undefined says Version 3.0.0, I'll debug today, it's probably my code.
undefined says Thanks for the tutorials.
Since I'm running fork tests, the message sent from L1 will never arrive on L2 since I have to use another RPC node for L2, so they don't share the same state.

I've written fork tests for Optimism and basically I impersonate the CrossDomainMessenger and send on L2 the message I would have received from L1.
https://github.com/pooltogether/ERC5164/blob/ced2125daedb88dccaf98376b8b89d27a61b0506/test/EthereumToOptimismFork.t.sol#L171

It's not really clear in the Arbitrum documentation how messages coming from L1 are then processed on L2.
And I was wondering if there was an easy way to impersonate the bridge on L2 to send a message coming from L1.
undefined says @0xMo0nR3kt3r geth tracing is supported
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/test/testhelper.ts
undefined says Ah thanks!
undefined says thank you. I'd like to write a  research paper quantifying on mev on Arbitrum, so this will be useful. Do you guys have any other resource on the subject ?
undefined says Ok so apparently Hardhat doesn't support Arbitrum Goerli yet, that's why it fails.
https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3257
undefined says Hi, we don’t have tx pool(mempool) on arbitrum which means there won’t be a tx collection let sequencer to choose who can be first to include in the network like l1. However, we use first come first serve model, once the user’s gas price provided higher than the base fee of our network, we will include it directly. You can see more about our sequencer here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-sequencer
undefined says I've modified the helper a bit to work on the L2 side and pass function calls instead of data. Thanks again for the help!

undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  I have two questions
undefined says nitro node reboot takes about 2 hours to sync，Is this normal?
undefined says The second problem, the nitro node restarted and started syncing from snapshot height again, I don't know why
undefined says Sync from nitro genesis?
undefined says Perhaps your setting is wrong, could you share with me your start flags?
undefined says yes
undefined says Then it’s normal
undefined says But you don’t need to start from genesis every time, you can share with me your start command
undefined says 
undefined says This is the startup file that we load from the snapshot when the data directory doesn't exist, but it still starts syncing from the snapshot data when we reboot a second time
undefined says Jason, can you see any problem?
undefined says You don’t need to add —init.url if you have a local nitro database
undefined says If you add, it will download from that url and init from genesis.
undefined says -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says The second reboot we won't have -init.url
undefined says Add this to mount your arbitrum database to the docker
undefined says hey guys
undefined says where would i share a new game ive launched on arbitrum
undefined says You can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says I already did
undefined says like 10 min ago
undefined says Can i send link to website here?
undefined says its already finished and running
undefined says I dmed it to you Jason
undefined says I also messaged @davidb | Offchain Labs and @bharat | Arbitrum  i see in their profile it says partnerships@
undefined says Oh, just saw you don’t use docker way, so you should check if your DATA_DIR exists as expected, I am afraid it goes to the first statement.
undefined says We can confirm that it did not take the first statement, but executed the second one
undefined says What is your ADDITIONAl_DEAON_ARGS? If it goes to the second one, there should be a flag pointer to genesis database.
undefined says ADDITIONAl_DEAON_ARGS = --persistent.global-config /data-ephemeral --l1.url https://geth
undefined says I find it unbelievable, but I'm sure the start is the second command
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Can you see anything wrong with the logs I marked?
undefined says Seems your chain re-org at 29495521
undefined says I see it says `running nitro node` at 03:43:39, did you restart it?
undefined says Yes, it's UTC time, reboot manually
undefined says Oh, if so, perhaps you don’t use graceful shutdown.
undefined says Which cause the database crashed
undefined says You should upgrade your node to the latest version and graceful shutdown next time.
undefined says We are closed normally
undefined says Our node is now v2.0.6 and I will upgrade
undefined says I don't think it's a node version issue
undefined says You can try send SIGTERM, then 30 seconds later send SIGKILL next time.
undefined says We make clean shutdown on v2.0.2, but you should shutdown the node gracefully each time.
undefined says I don't know what kind of optimization you are talking about off.All our other nodes are restarted like this
undefined says https://stackoverflow.com/questions/690415/in-what-order-should-i-send-signals-to-gracefully-shutdown-processes
undefined says supervisorctl stop a graceful stop? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says We use supervisorctl stop to stop the service
undefined says Haven’t used that before, does it have supervisorctl stop —time xx?
undefined says If so, you can manually set it to about 30s
undefined says We don’t send the SIGKILL command, only send SIGTERM.We don’t send the SIGKILL command, only send SIGTERM.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says What is the version when you stop your node? V 2.0.0?
undefined says V 2.0.6
undefined says We just tried again and I'm sure we're using the graceful way to close
undefined says But he still starts syncing from snapshot height
undefined says Is it possible that there is a synchronization mode problem that？
undefined says **Head state missing**, repairing number=23,195,960 hash=c6501e..683746 snaproot=1bc6fc..37f5d6
undefined says **--node.caching.archive** We added this parameter to reboot and it works fine
undefined says But block synchronization will slow down
undefined says It’s weird, checking with team
undefined says If I use Abritrum Bridge, it will stuck 8 days for claiming?
undefined says Usually it'll take 7-8 days for withdrawing funds from Arbitrum One/Nova to ETH mainnet through official bridge.
undefined says yep
undefined says Maybe too long,
undefined says Are there any updates?
undefined says We are seeing this issue, will test what’s going wrong there.
undefined says 😦 we want 10/15 minutes as before
undefined says You can use 3rd part bridge to have a instant bridge, you can find them here: https://portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says hh
undefined says Maybe
undefined says Is it to be expected that when making a call to my nitro node for a block that is far enough in the past (like ~30 minutes) that I am getting an error telling that there is a missing trie node <HASH>?
undefined says is this the right place to ask a noob question related to blockchain development?
undefined says awesome news
undefined says aaaaaaaaaaaa
undefined says damn, the spam filter here is terrible
undefined says impossible to talk, great!
undefined says anyway, I want to run a nitro node at goerli, where can I find more info?
undefined says 
undefined says getting errors like this /\
undefined says Is there a clean tutorial to setup the node NOT in a docker ? i need a node with systemctl controls
undefined says I also want directions NOT with docker, thanks
undefined says where can I find more information on archival nodes for arbitrum?
undefined says Does the ethereum consensus client affect the performance of arbitrum?
undefined says Any update
undefined says Is it possible to know if a message from L1 has been redeemed on L2 if we only have the ticket ID?

I've seen in the SDK that we can use `getL1ToL2Messages` to retrieve the status of a message but it requires the L1 transaction receipt.
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk#redeem-an-l1-to-l2-message

Let's say I don't have the L1 transaction receipt but I have the ticket ID. Is there any simple solution to check that this ticket ID got redeemed?

I suppose I could look at the `redeemScheduled` event but I would have to monitor it.
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/precompiles#ArbRetryableTx
undefined says Did you call archive method?
undefined says You can see this docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node, if you want to compile it locally, you can refer to: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says Just like geth
undefined says Refer to this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says It won’t
undefined says You can also call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L31 as a helper
undefined says Ah great! Thank you.
undefined says oh yeah
undefined says Does NOVA allow for the dApp creators to pay gas fees while ONE does not?
undefined says when will we be able to run validators in anything other than watchtower mode?
undefined says You mean account abstraction? Currently not
undefined says We don’t have timeline for this now.
undefined says I'm trying to use the Greeter from the arbitrum/tutorials. 
So, I succeed in making L1 and L2 contracts, and the code runs until "Greeting txn confirmed on L1!" 

But then, after 10 min, I keep getting an error saying 
[ArbSdkError: Timed out waiting to retrieve retryable creation receipt: ]
at main "const status = await message.waitForStatus()" 

It seems like there is a problem in ArbSDK at L1toL2MessageReader and L1toL2MessageWriter. 

Has anyone succeeded in running a Greeter.sol?
undefined says Which network are you running?
undefined says running in goerli
undefined says Could you share the tx you sent to make cross layer message?
undefined says > Lycra — 12/10/2022

For my learning, what are the benefits of running the node not using docker? 🤔
undefined says I am confused, someone is saying NOVA and ONE have same tx fee cost, but its also advertised the NOVA is much cheaper?
undefined says #💻︱protocol
undefined says anyone knows Arbitrum public rpc endpoint that supports eth_newFilter?
undefined says What is the purpose of ArbOS(a4b05) to ArbOS tx in every tx?
undefined says G.
undefined says nice day
undefined says !differences
undefined says Arbitrum Nova is a chain that provides ultra low-cost transactions with strong security guarantees that operate alongside Arbitrum One, with the main use-cases include social applications and gaming!

Arbitrum Nova is operated by a committee of nodes, with a minimal assumption about how many committee members are honest.

undefined says Don't really know about running a node
undefined says Nice
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node you can check the official doc about how to run node on Arbitrum.
undefined says https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413938850075-What-s-the-hardware-requirements-to-run-the-full-node-
And these are hardware requirements for running node on Arbitrum One.
undefined says Thanks 🙏
undefined says Hope everything will be done as planned
undefined says +1
undefined says This is used to start a block
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labscan i dm you?
undefined says Sure
undefined says Thanks, any docs? 😅
undefined says I don’t think we have such a docs for this, there is always a StartBlock transaction that does administrative work associated with creating a block. By making this a visible transaction, we make it traceable so there is more visibility into what it is doing.
undefined says hey guys, have a quick question abt the architecture upgrade from Nitro and if it affects the following statement

> Also, while Optimism and Arbitrum are both EVM compatible, Optimism uses Ethereum’s EVM, whereas Arbitrum runs its own Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM). This results in Optimism having only a Solidity compiler, while Arbitrum supports all EVM compiled languages (Vyper, Yul, etc).
undefined says I know Arbitrum still uses its own VM but it is more in-line with the Geth integrations from Nitro
undefined says We now abandoned AVM and use geth core to execute tx, this sentence is for our classic version
undefined says Not protocol related, but not sure where else to put this. There is an error in the Arbiscan Daily Transactions data. Timescale and data markers don't match
undefined says We know the issue and reported it to the etherscan team. waiting for them to fix it
undefined says sweet, thanks!
undefined says 😄
undefined says Probably not the appropriate channel, but I think it is warranted. Seeing this being passed around servers and twitter. Could someone confirm the authenticity? https://arbiscan.io/token/0xd4d2f4110878a33ea5b97f0665e518253446161a

undefined says Any dev??
Need help in finding some contract!!
My wallet compromised.. as whenever I swap any token to usdc in arbitrum, it is going to other wallet!!
I revoked the contract!! Can some one find what I had interacted?

undefined says Yup, just connect your wallet to arbitrum network is ok
undefined says Happy
undefined says nice
undefined says Hey, thanks for this guide for running both archive versions of Arbitrum Classic & Nitro.

After downloading the archive snapshot for Arbitrum Classic, what are the tags needed to run an archive node? I'm using the docker image: `offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4`

I'd noticed after downloading and extracting the latest db-archive.tar (with data up to July of this year), the directory size is larger than my own "archive" directory with data up to August, by at least 200GB... which tells me I must not have been properly running an archive node.

I'm using the following flags:

--l1.url http://geth-mainnet:8545
--node.rpc.enable-l1-calls
--node.cache.allow-slow-lookup
--core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000
--node.rpc.tracing.enable
--node.rpc.addr=0.0.0.0
--node.rpc.port=8545
--node.ws.addr=0.0.0.0
--node.ws.port=8546
--node.rpc.tracing.namespace="trace"
--node.chain-id=42161
--l2.disable-upstream
undefined says Hey, Yannick, if you want to run archive node for classic node, you should add those 2 flags: --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000
undefined says Thanks, ok yeah looks like I've had those 2 flags before. I'm still curious to know why my archive directory with up to August 2022 data is only 402GB, whereas the fully extracted https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar with data up to July 2022 is 610GB.
undefined says Might because your node has been pruned
undefined says How do I ensure pruning remains disabled?

Ahh, looks like my latest .sst & .log files are at 287377 (for August 2022), whereas the db-archive.tar's latest .sst & .log files are at 453794 for July 2022.
undefined says After v1.2.1, the node will prune automatically, any reason why you want to disable them?
undefined says Yeah, I'm indexing all historical transactions & balances as part of LedgerQL.com's block explorer efforts
undefined says Let me check with our node team to see if we have any method to disable it.
undefined says thanks
undefined says Is `--node.rpc.nitroexport.enable` on the Classic node needed to make requests via my Nitro node, or is having `--node.rpc.classic-redirect` on Nitro all I need?

What exactly does `--node.rpc.nitroexport.enable` on the Classic node do?
undefined says `nitroexport` is used for export the database to nitro database: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/state-migration.md#exporting-data-from-a-classic-arbitrum-node
undefined says You just need to add `--node.rpc.classic-redirect`
undefined says Does anyone know if is it possible to run a node, or is it too late?
undefined says `INFO [10-19|11:56:05.245] created block                            l2Block=28,857,385 l2BlockHash=a32601..aa66e2 l1Block=15,695,359 l1Timestamp=2022-10-07T09:34:07+0000

undefined says I'm guessing the below is probably the prunning flag to run? I ran --help to see what's available:

`--core.checkpoint-pruning-mode string                            Prune old checkpoints: 'on', 'off', or 'default' (default "default")`

I'm not sure what exactly 'default' provides, but I guess I'll set that to 'off'
undefined says 
undefined says this might be a simple question,
so in arbitrum nitro, the inbox, delayed inbox, outbox are located in EthBridge on top of layer 1?
undefined says Do you mean that the cross-chain didn't arrive?
undefined says Is it possible to get the from (original sender) address of the l2msg on the sequencer feed?
undefined says is there any documentation on Arbitrum specific RPC endpoints for nitro? I see that one of the default HTTP api modules is `arb`, but am not finding any documentation on that module
undefined says You can recover public key from v,r,s, and then get the from address from public key
undefined says Rpc endpoint is the same as eth rpc endpoint
undefined says They are not the same contract, they are different contracts, but will interact with bridge contract
undefined says It depends on your disk performance
undefined says It’s not possible to pruning an archive node, have you started your node?
undefined says helo man
undefined says It was about the services we provide. We're a team of web3 professionals.
undefined says Sorry, you can’t make ads here
undefined says It's not kind of ads sir
undefined says This channel only for arbitrum protocol q&a
undefined says Hey, I've noticed there were 2 crates created on crates.io (Rust package repo) regarding arbitrum: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/offchainlabs-rust & https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-rust . I was wondering if you guys are working on a Rust sdk? Is it something that's in progress?
undefined says Thanks yeah I'd figured things out. The archive snapshot actually has more history than my originally synced node, hence the larger size.

The only problem now is over 12 hrs have passed since I've attempted to launch my node with the db-archive.tar file, and it's stuck with the below. Is that normal? I'm using NVME's with high disk IOPS:

`Previous checkpoint,  total gas used: 0, L1 block: 0, L2 block: 0, log count: 0, messages count: 0, timestamp: Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970`
`Last        database checkpoint,  total gas used: 94242532138470, L1 block: 15442605, L2 block: 22045628, log count: 46914889, messages count: 45898655, timestamp: Tue Aug 30 21:05:10 2022`
`Last  valid database checkpoint,  total gas used: 94242532138470, L1 block: 15442605, L2 block: 22045628, log count: 46914889, messages count: 45898655, timestamp: Tue Aug 30 21:05:10 2022`

These are the flags I'm passing onto the Arbitrum Classic Docker image, using `offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4`:

--l1.url http://geth-mainnet:8545 (properly points to my Geth node RPC)
--node.rpc.enable-l1-calls
--node.cache.allow-slow-lookup
--core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000
--node.rpc.tracing.enable
--node.rpc.addr=0.0.0.0
--node.rpc.port=8547
--node.ws.addr=0.0.0.0
--node.ws.port=8548
--node.rpc.tracing.namespace="trace"
--node.chain-id=42161
--l2.disable-upstream
undefined says Is your NVMe gen3 or gen4?
undefined says Micron 7450 Max, Gen 4
undefined says 1M IOPS rand-read, 410K IOPS rand-write. I doubt that's the problem
undefined says Is your l1 node works fine?
undefined says Yep, my Go-Ethereum client is up-to-date with proper communication to my consensus client (Nimbus)
undefined says Since you are using high performance disk, it is weird to be so slow of your node
undefined says It's a mystery to me as well lol. Maybe I need to follow standard IT protocol & reboot my machine 😅
undefined says Ah, maybe you can try it
undefined says ok
undefined says I am running Greeter.sol in arbitrum/tutorials in goerli chain. Didn't change any code except for setting up .env 

I sometimes succeed and sometimes don't. Can I know why this is happening?

undefined says thank you!
undefined says Do the sequencer feed messages contain who the transaction was sent by? I'm trying to decode the sequencer messages, i can see there's a 'sender' field, but that seems to be the same across all messages (corresponding to the address of the inbox on L1?). I'm after who sent each transaction, i.e. tx.origin. Thank you
undefined says It contains v r s, you can use them to recovery the public key, and then get the address

undefined says If I'm running a validator node, are there no `nitro` specific RPC endpoints? I would have thought there would be some...?
undefined says How do I setup a node
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I contacted stratosnft support but they checked and said there is an error on the Arbitrum network.  Then I contacted Arbitrum on Discord platform, in support and they correctly confirmed that 5Nft payment only received 4Nft, but they can't solve the problem, what should I do?

undefined says 🤪🤪
undefined says Yup, we have plans to do this
undefined says Hey, could you please explain how you managed to make it work? My flags are almost identical, using the same node and I've also been stuck on the exact same log as yours for 2 days..
undefined says I'm on an EBS dual-gp3 zfs based volume mount if that helps
undefined says Hi, gp3’s io is not so powerful, what is your latest logs?
undefined says Hey, I'm running everything as Docker containers on Rocky Linux 8.5, with ports 8547 & 8548 as my Arbitrum Classic RPC & Websocket ports. I'm also using a custom Docker network: geth-mainnet, shared with my Go-Ethereum node which is using ports 8545 & 8546 for its RPC & Websocket ports. When I reference my Go-Ethereum RPC port, I'm using the following flag: --l1.url http://geth-mainnet:8545.

After downloading the db-archive.tar, I had to run the following in my Arbitrum directory: `chmod -fR 777`. It however took a couple of hours for my Arbitrum node to start syncing, maybe 6+ hours... as I'd stepped away from my home, came back, and saw it eventually magically started. 😅
undefined says Arbitrum Classic Mainnet Commands:

`docker run -d -it --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 --restart unless-stopped --stop-timeout 300 --log-opt max-size=10m --name arbitrum-classic-mainnet --cpus 16 --memory 16g --net geth-mainnet -v /arbitrum/classic/mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url http://geth-mainnet:8545 --node.rpc.enable-l1-calls --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000 --node.rpc.tracing.enable --node.rpc.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.rpc.port=8547 --node.ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.ws.port=8548 --node.rpc.tracing.namespace="trace" --node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream`

undefined says Not sure why an AWS GP3 system cannot properly run Arbitrum... sounds like a Go-Ethereum / Leveldb design flaw somewhere.
undefined says In first img, Top half is disk stats reported by zfs. Bottom half is most recent arbitrum classic logs
Note that both nitro and classic are running on the system. Disk R/W IOPS sum can hit upto 6k, bandwidth can go upto 1G, so we don't seem to be capped on disk performance from  what I can tell..
htop indicates mem is fully used. Do I need to increase the resource, or is the node designed to use all resource available to it?
undefined says This seems very interesting to me, since I also setup bor (polygon's geth fork) from 6TB+ snapshot few months back and it booted up almost instantly. Seems more like a config hiccup on my part 😅
undefined says The only concrete difference I can tell from my config here is that my erigon (eth node) is on another instance, but same AZ. So latency is still sub-ms.
And that I have fewer cores (4) and uncapped memory consumption
undefined says Arbitrum classic needs a longer time initiate, it is normal, because it needs to check the last state one by one for security, but when set up nitro, it will be much faster.
undefined says And the initial time depends on disk performance
undefined says - Is there a way to check the progress of validation?
- Will rebooting the node make it restart validation, or will it resume from previous shutdown? If it can resume I'll schedule a more powerful instance
undefined says We didn’t do this, and if you reboot, it will restart it from beginning.
undefined says Alright, thank you for your clarifications! Guess I'll wait a day or two more 😅
undefined says Have a nice day all
undefined says You too bro
undefined says IIUC, anyone can run a Watchtower validator, correct?
undefined says To be correct, the initiate time of arbitrum classic is more depends on disk latency, even if you have a super high IOPS, but with a high latency, which will also slow down
undefined says Nope, it still has whitelist
undefined says How much swap do you have to get into the white book?
undefined says Let’s say by chance that you guys do airdrop a token, this is completely hypothetical, could y’all make sure it is claimable through Coinbase Wallet? Almost every other protocol always leaves out connectivity options for Coinbase wallet.
undefined says why
undefined says Anyone can run watchtower validator because it doesn’t do any on-chain assertions, just logs errors if it finds anything.
undefined says I’ll be sure to fill Jason in, I think he just didnt know what watchtower mode did 🙂
undefined says When can we expect you guys to submit a DappNode package for Arbitrum Nitro on the DAppStore? Huge barrier to getting truly decentralized nodes online that don't depend on centralized hardware like AWS.

Please clarify point about transaction latency in Arbitrum? If to consider sequenser as centralized entity, I would guess that it is near instant in Arbitum, but Arbitrum latency also depend on Ethereum latency. What would happen in case Ethereum reorganisation? So I need clarification on following questions:
1) Do Arbitrum have same latency as Ethereum?
2) What if Ethereum reorganisation happend but a lot activity happend on Arbitrum?Does this mean that the state of the arbiter will roll back?
3) Once I send a transaction to Arbitrum, how long before I can say with 100% certainty that my transaction is permanently on the blockchain?

undefined says Stop spamming !role here, no meaning for this
undefined says 1) There are multiple level of finality depending on your trust assumption 
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/tx-lifecycle
2) L1 reorg will affect L2 in the way that different L1->L2 message might be included / missing. The sequencer will wait for L1 to be finalized before relaying the message to L2. In the very unlikely event that L2 reorg, the transaction sequence will preserves but the state transition will differ. But this require a deep reorg in L1 which is unlikely in POS
3) The sequencer post batch to L2 every ~5 minutes https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c479675ad559dc151f6ec7ed3fbf8cee79582b6; when the batch transaction is finalized on L1 (~10 minutes), you can consider your transaction is finalized

undefined says The hardware requirement for running nitro node is the same as go-ethereum.
undefined says For contract deploy, you can check if your contract has those features: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/solidity-support , if so, you can see the difference and made a change to your contract, if not, just deploy it directly is ok.

undefined says Greetings @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Thank you kindly for the recently provided links; I’ve finally had some time to dive into arbitrum some more & also how to run a node (it’s my first time) & I appreciate the effort spent on these medium articles. Question for ya- I have a dedicated computer for running an Arbitrum node and a friend who is a dev. he’s not crypto savvy, but I showed him the code the other day and he said it wouldn’t be a prob to help me get set up. I’m moving in a week and hoping to have this computer setup to run a node/validator before I move (with the help of a dev). Do you think it would it be pretty straightforward to set the computer up at its new permanent location after my friend helps me set it up initially? I feel confident enough to maintain the system once it’s up and running, but initial setup is over my head…
undefined says Hi, once your node up, you still need to restart it and upgrade to our new version if the latest version is mandatory, but start the node would be very easy if your friend can teach you, it won’t cost too much time.
undefined says Far out! This is great to hear. Looking forward to this. Very impressed with the ecosystem from a user perspective & I believe arbitrum is going places 💫
undefined says One more quick one for ya- is there a preferred OS for running an arbitrum node/validator? I’m gonna be setting up a couple different computers soon (I have a couple gala music nodes I need to get going too) and would like to have the best setup possible for arbitrum. I have a decent Mac tower to start with, and will have very fast internet/reliable electricity 😬

undefined says am trying to progmatically transfer usdc using ether js however the gas fees seem too much ( 85000000000000000000000 to send 0.8 usdc ) is there anything am missing or could be the issue ?
undefined says How did you get this amount?
undefined says Just use ethersjs to send the function call?
undefined says Are you making use of Arbiturm Node??
undefined says loaded it from binance

undefined says You can use public rpc directly
undefined says can i make use of testnet token on Arbireum??
undefined says Do you have any for me??

Wait do rpc work with Node also??
undefined says Full node can provide rpc service, if you don’t want to run your own node, you can just use our public rpc
undefined says Btw, there is no roles for running a node
undefined says the cost still seems to be high am trying to estimategas fees thats failing as well

undefined says Since a transfer on arbitrum isn't always exactly 21000 gas, is there a programatic way to tell if a tx is a raw transfer send vs a contract call using Dune v2? 

The parameters dune offers are:
```
block_time
value
block_number
gas_limit
gas_price
gas_used
max_fee_per_gas
max_priority_fee_per_gas
priority_fee_per_gas
nonce
index
success
from
to
block_hash
data
hash
type
access_list
effective_gas_price
gas_used_for_l1
```
undefined says You could check if gas_used - gas_used_for_l1 == 2100 to get an equivalent statement
undefined says That said, it kinda depends on what you mean by "raw transfer". For instance, someone could include calldata in a send to an EOA
undefined says great. that looks promising. that `calldata` case you mentioned would not matter in this particular case. initial tests show that this works as intended. ty 🙏

undefined says Hey everyone!

I have a question about gas prices and how to calculate the gas cost (in ETH) for a given transaction. My questions is a little bit about how 2D fees work exactly. I read https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#fees, but I don't quite understand how to calculate it. If I calculate the estimated gas + the gas price by calling the RPC, do I just do `gasPrice * estimatedGas` and that would be it? Is that enough? Or do I need to do something else?

In my previous experience with Optimism, I had to calculate both l1Gas and l2Gas, but I'm not sure if I need to so the same here
undefined says What’s good

undefined says got a question: we're seeing that block times are coming down as transactions volume is increasing on Arbitrum... right now, we're seeing block time is about 0.4s whereas a week ago it was just above a second
undefined says can anyone point me to some docs on how this works?
undefined says I see this in the docs:
`ArbOS and the Sequencer are responsible for delineating when one Arbitrum block ends and the next one begins; one should expect to see Arbitrum blocks produced at a relatively steady rate.`

but that doesn't really seem to be the case looking at Arbiscan data
undefined says (from https://developer.arbitrum.io/time)
undefined says (btw I'm talking about Arbitrum One)
undefined says I'm writing some contracts to run on a local nitro testnet that interacts with some of the precompiles, example:
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.4.21 <0.9.0;
import {ArbSys} from "https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/develop/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbSys.sol";

contract BlocknumGetter {
    event Foo(uint256 indexed a);
    function emitBlocknum() external{
    uint256 txCount = ArbSys(address(0x64)).arbBlockNumber();

    emit Foo(txCount);
  }
    function emit123() external {
        emit Foo(123);
    }
}
```
Calling `emit123()` works fine, but  `emitBlocknum()` always reverts. Deploying using remix injected provider/Metamask with network `http://localhost:9545`. Was wondering if anyone could help me get this example working. Using the address found in `precompiles.md`.
undefined says please note that #☕︱gm is the best place for short greetings.
undefined says Hey, our block time is not fixed as what l1 do, it depends on the network congestion, and we have a min block time which is 250ms, if tx arrived to sequencer which within the same 250ms, they will be Included in the same block.
undefined says Is your local host:9545 is arbitrum network?
undefined says Please don't send your address to this channel!
undefined says Is there a status page for the arbi one RPC and sequencer?
undefined says Hi i got a question regarding the arbitrum sequencer
undefined says As described in the docs the sequencer is storing batches of transaction on mainnet every couple of minutes.
undefined says But what in particular is stored within the transaction data ? Seems to be an array of hashes but not transaction hashes in particular.
undefined says It'd be much too expensive to store all transaction hashes on L1 , so we post the full transaction data to L1 in the form of calldata but only store the hash of each batch posted. You can read the SequencerInbox and Bridge source for more details.
undefined says Alright got it. Is it possible to use the hashes of the batch to verify on mainnet, that certain data exists on a smart contract deployed on arbitrum?
undefined says I'd recommend verifying that via the confirmed assertions on the rollup which include the block hash
undefined says from the block hash you can do a traditional proof of a contract's state
undefined says it is at least 1 week delayed though, as are all L2->L1 messages due to the challenge window
undefined says Do i also have to wait 1 week even finality is not that important for the use case?
undefined says Okay may you give me a link to a doc/tutorial/code where the usage of shared assertions is shown? That would help ma alot
undefined says I don't think we have any documentation on that. The recommended way is just to make a traditional L2->L1 message
undefined says May you share the link of the smart contract where the assertions are made? I'm not that deep into the arbitrum yet 🙂
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef0d09d1e6204141b4d37530808ed19f60fba35 and source at https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol
undefined says Thank you for your help 👍
undefined says what is requirements for arbitrum fullnode?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs sir
undefined says The requirement is similar to running a Geth node!
undefined says I'm running ethereum-etl against a node and I am getting the 'code': -32601 'the method trace_block does not exist/is not available' as an error. Is there a way to get the traces from the RPC API?
undefined says Since nitro is based on geth, we provide the geth tracing APIs (e.g. `debug_traceTransaction`) if enabled via `--http.api`
undefined says Please why am I not eligible to claim Odyssey
undefined says Bump!
undefined says Check #📬︱support  for help
undefined says Not at the moment but this is something we're looking into
undefined says Hmm, do any of the CEXs that provide direct arbitrum off-ramps have status pages that track this? Just an idea for a stopgap in the meantime
undefined says no idea, sorry
undefined says no worries, thank you
undefined says Please I want to know why my approval on my Petra wallet wouldn’t come out after I tried to deposit some APT from Acro Protocol
undefined says #📬︱support
undefined says Done running a node.. What's next should I fill up something?
undefined says test
undefined says Hola @gzeon | Offchain Labs  or whoever is able to help. I'm struggling to find a reference on how to build the `calldata` parameter for the `outboundTransfer` bridge function. I have been able to bridge assets sending the abi encoded `max_submission_cost`, but I see that most transactions have extra data appended to that parameter. What is that additional data for?
Also, I would expect that the `getOutboundCalldata` public function returns the calldata to be used as parameter for the `outboundTransfer`, but that just does not work. What am I missing?
undefined says "but I see that most transactions have extra data appended to that parameter"
not sure what you mean, the data field should be (uint256 maxSubmissionFee, bytes _data) but usually the _data is ""
undefined says ok, good to know. I probably picked bad examples.
undefined says what are some safe values for `maxGas`, `gasPriceBid` and `maxSubmissionCost`? I wouldn't want to implement my own `L1ToL2MessageGasEstimator` 😅
undefined says meaning, values that will almost always be enough
undefined says we don't recommend to hardcode, but you insist to hardcode you can observe the common value used onchain and add a buffer on top of that
undefined says ok, thanks 🙏
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs is there a way to get the traces data from legacy blocks?
undefined says You need to run an arbitrum classic node
undefined says or maybe some node providers provide classic tracing, I'm not sure
undefined says May I ask what’s the hardware requirement to run sequencer after it becomes decentralized?
undefined says is there any snapshot tgz for nova node?
undefined says dude you entering wrong room lol this is arbitrum
undefined says i need info to deploy my own token and contract
undefined says i get this error : "Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [execution reverted] "
undefined says #📬︱support
undefined says no but it should sync fairly quickly and no genesis state is required
undefined says has anyone had trouble getting solgen to run and install go packages? this is the error i am facing https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1296#issuecomment-1296305260
undefined says try running it from the top-level directory with `go run ./solgen`
undefined says thanks Lee! thanks for the quick response. same issue when i run from the top-level. i added a print statement to confirm that the segfault comes on this line: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/7b7bff99263531dd5ed29d35697d379dc41b0967/solgen/gen.go#L138
undefined says `modules["precompilesgen"]` is nil for some reason
undefined says maybe there is a prereq having something else built ?
undefined says Maybe the contracts haven't been built with hardhat. I'd recommend just using `make build-node-deps`
undefined says or `make contracts` to just build the contracts parts
undefined says trying that thanks!
undefined says its asking me to run ./build-brotli.sh -l but that throws a cmake error. do i need to `git clone https://github.com/google/brotli`?
undefined says ```
CMake Error: The source directory "/Users/michaelneuder/nitro/brotli" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.
```
undefined says `git submodule update --init --recursive`
undefined says nice! working now 🙂
undefined says ill pull the commands i used together into a small MD doc if you think that would be helpful ?
undefined says Unfortunately the largest issue is differences between systems. A lot of people run into somewhat unique issues
undefined says We're looking at ways to approach this, but for now, we just recommend docker builds
undefined says i see. is there a way to use docker builds to build and run unit tests? like in that case i just wanted to run nitro/util/signature.test
undefined says You could probably use the `node-builder` docker target but it wasn't meant for this yeah
undefined says makes sense. well im up and running and will keep the commands handy if anyone else faces something similar
undefined says thanks, Lee!
undefined says thank you for the PR!
undefined says nice
undefined says #💻︱protocol
undefined says Nice
undefined says is there an aribitrum token deployer b ot anyone knows of?
as in for new token launches on arbi?
undefined says nice
undefined says There is no arbitrum token
undefined says How to run a node in Arbitrum?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says a
undefined says i have installed an arbitrum node and synced successfully. but when I want to stop the node for some reason, the whole database is deleted and I have to synchronize again from the beginning. What should I do to avoid this situation?
undefined says and i can't see any upgrade guide, do you have an instruction for this also?
undefined says Did you still use `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"` ?
undefined says it is for mainnet
undefined says i had tried with goerli
undefined says Ok, did you mount your docker last time?
undefined says so for goerli there is no database support as i can see. well, so if i stop node for mainnet, i shouldn't reuse this flag right?
undefined says For goerli, there is no need to use that flag, you should check your `-v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says I've seen this in the docs also but I don't fully understand it. Why do we need an external disk for mount? i want do this with my local disk but dunno how can do that.
undefined says Because you are using docker to run your node, you should mount a local dictionary to your docker’s /home/user/.arbitrum, so your docker can use your database.
undefined says Has anyone else had problems running solgen and installing go packages?
undefined says ok lets say i installed and synced the node via this command: (so without an external disks)

```
docker run --rm -it  -v ~/arbitrum:~/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.7-10b845c --l1.url https://l1-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=<L2ChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```
and for some reason i stoped it. 
```
docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
```

and now, i want to restart and dont want sync from scratch.
so what should i do?
undefined says i see. but I mean why an "external" disk? Why can't I connect the database to my local disk?
undefined says The external means outside your docker, can be your local disk. You can check if the database in your local ~/arbitrum
undefined says yes i checked. but there is no database on ~/arbitrum or ~/.arbitrum
undefined says thats so weird for me and i can't understand 😄
undefined says Where was the entire database even though I was fully synced?
undefined says It’s weird, do you start resyncing now?
undefined says yes i started again
undefined says Should also be ~/arbitrum
undefined says What is the requirements of VPS to run an Arbitrum node?
undefined says ok.
my full command: 
```docker run --rm -it -d -v $HOME/data/arbitrum:$HOME/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.7-10b845c --l1.url MY_URL --l2.chain-id=421613 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```

```$ du data/arbitrum/ -h
 
4.0K    data/arbitrum/```

and check screenshot for sync status.
undefined says same as go-ethereum
undefined says It seems start now, can you see your database now?
undefined says no - `data/arbitrum/` folder has 4kb file size.
undefined says You should enter the dictionary and see
undefined says also i can't see `.arbitrum` folder. is it normal?
undefined says np. 
`ls data/arbitrum` nothing show 😄
undefined says also
undefined says `ls -al data/arbitrum`
undefined says ```cs
~# ls -al data/arbitrum
total 8
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Oct 31 03:18 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Oct 31 03:18 ..
```
undefined says hate working with docker
undefined says any instructions for build source?
undefined says Ah, super weird, there should be `goerli-rollup` in that dictionary.
undefined says You can follow this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says ah hard way 😄
undefined says so what should i do? any ideas?
undefined says Does $HOME  is your current dictionary?
undefined says yes
undefined says It’s weird, let me check with our other team members.
undefined says ~ # echo $HOME
`/root`

i am in the root.
undefined says thank you.
undefined says just tried mainnet. and got this error 😃 😃 

> *panic: attempting to init genesis block 0, but this block is in database with no state root*
undefined says I need to sleep. I hope I find a solution to this tomorrow. thanks again.
undefined says You should add `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"` when starting mainnet.
undefined says yes i already did
undefined says Can you try not to use ~ or $HOME?
undefined says Or use `$HOME/data/arbitrm:/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says works with `/root/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says created these folders manually `/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says This is in your docker, you don’t need to create on your local dictionary
undefined says On remix, what is the difference between deploying through injected web3 (MetaMask with Arb networked picked) and the drop-down option Arbitrum L2 Provider?
undefined says If you click arbitrum one provider, it will add our network to your wallet.
undefined says There is no difference in deployment between this and injected web3?
undefined says No difference
undefined says Thank you! Wasn’t sure
undefined says kkak
undefined says Nah I meant, a bo t that alerts you for new tokens made on the arbitrum chain, or liquidity added to brand new tokens
undefined says You can see it on dextools, but it’s lagging I think, shows hrs in between new tokens
undefined says shitcoins traders in here will understand my req
undefined says We probably don’t officially provide this tool, you may try find it on our community or contact dextools to see if they have this code open source.
undefined says 👍
undefined says ahh got you, thanks for the reply g
undefined says is there a way to obtain a true random number on Arbitrum yet?
undefined says chainlink VRF is not supporting Arbitrum unfortunately
undefined says it is for mainnet
i had tried with goerli
undefined says Can someone please share guide. how i can deploy smart contract on Arbitrum network?

Or maybe there is an official guide? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says #🔗︱links check out or docs!
undefined says its the same tho as it is on ethereum, just make sure you use an arbitrum rpc
undefined says is there a way to find out which ones do? I'd prefer to use theirs if possible
undefined says I had the same issue where the docker data does not actually mount to the disk, which makes it not persist.
undefined says You can try api3’s qrng.
undefined says What is your node start command?
undefined says what is this 7 days for to  receive in  eth network ?
undefined says ☝️
undefined says +-
undefined says If you send token from l2 to l1 through our bridge, it need takes 8 days because of the fraud proof, if you want to have fast withdraw, you can try 3rd party bridge next time.
undefined says thanks
undefined says Protocollo
undefined says Protocol
undefined says 666
undefined says Guys, could you please share any tutorials for beginners?
undefined says ok
undefined says 
undefined says how CAN I fix
undefined says Are you running arbitrum node using docker? Try docker ps to see if it is running
undefined says I checked
undefined says not running
undefined says root@MSI-X570-A-PRO:~# sudo docker ps
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
undefined says ok i found the problem a situation related to windows WSL
undefined says hm
undefined says gg
undefined says gg
undefined says Gg
undefined says Gh
undefined says Arbitrum Nitro is a version of the protocol running on the chain called "Arbitrum One" (?)
undefined says What is Nova?
undefined says Hey! Arbitrum one is an optimistic rollup chain built on the Nitro stack whereas Arbitrum Nova is an AnyTrust chain. AnyTrust chains are an Arbitrum chain type, distinct from Arbitrum Rollup chains. 

The fundamental tradeoff between Rollup and AnyTrust is decentralization vs. transaction costs: Rollup chains inherit their security directly from layer 1 without introducing new trust assumptions, whereas AnyTrust chains introduce their own security assumption, and are thus able to charge users lower fees.
undefined says Any napkin math / infographic to compare? 10x, 100x cost reduction?
undefined says Not sure if this is accurate, but metamask was saying $0.4 to set a bool in a contract on arbi one. Just curious how this would translate on Nova if possible...
undefined says We do not have such cost comparisons as it really varies in different cases. But it suffices to say Nova is way more cheaper than Nitro
undefined says https://randomizer.ai (on arbitrum goerli atm)
undefined says How can one help build/enforce arb network
undefined says Validators or some sort of stuff
undefined says I'll be interested. Thanks
undefined says Does anyone have a resource on running an RPC node for Arbitrum Goerli?
undefined says I can find dated snapshots in the docs for Arb Rinkeby but not Goerli
undefined says Our validators are still whitelisted but stay tuned for more updates! 🚀
undefined says Yeah that's what I saw on the main website
undefined says great job
undefined says Gg
undefined says can someone explain how sequencer sign each feed message and nodes validate signatures
undefined says how this work
undefined says 🧐
undefined says @joshua.colvin | Offchain Labs
undefined says how do I speak to mods?
undefined says the automod is blocking every message I send. I
undefined says you can´t Rocco lol
undefined says Hey guys are there alternatives to tenderly for debugging on Arbitrum Goerli Testnet? Running into a blackbox bug after deploying to Goerli Testnet, would love to see where the code is breaking
undefined says we deployed to arb goerli testnet and one of the functions is failing but it is giving us a very vague general message "A Status Code indicating if the top-level call succeeded or failed (applicable for Post BYZANTIUM blocks only)"
undefined says link?
undefined says What contract do you guys use for USDC on Goerli Arbitrum Testnet?
undefined says https://www.evm.codes/#45?fork=merge
undefined says ☝️
undefined says 💫💫
undefined says hmm
undefined says hmmm
undefined says chcking
undefined says For sequencer feed message, you can see them by `wscat -c wss://arb1.arbitrum.it/feed`, and here is how we set a new broadcast feed message here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/broadcaster/broadcaster.go#L73
undefined says Do not send h i or something like this
undefined says I don’t think we have a snapshot for goerli arbitrum newtwork, but it should won’t take too long to sync since it just started this year.
undefined says Gg
undefined says guys
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labshello sir want run a node for incentive is there any available nodes on arbi
undefined says please guide im new here
undefined says @Harry | Offchain Labs
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs
undefined says There is no incentives for running full node on arbitrum.
undefined says But if you want to run one, here is the guide: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says heyheye
undefined says How can I connect my twitter in arbitrum adventures?
undefined says cheers
undefined says #📬︱support
undefined says Is there any services on Chain on Arbitrum One that was Verified RNG?
undefined says To upgrade my node can I just rerun the docker command with the containers replaced?
undefined says (After gracefully shutting current node down)
undefined says The current database will then remain intact right?
undefined says The database is mounted so
undefined says Should be good right? 🙂
undefined says Try api3’s qrng
undefined says Cheers
undefined says The database is mounted to your docker, if you stop docker by clean way, it won’t affect your database, you can stop it by `docker stop arb --time 300`
undefined says Then when you next start, just remount your database is ok.
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says thanks a lot, that's what I thought as well! :))
undefined says Could you explain to me if Arbitrum supports the trace_transaction call usually provided by Erigon or OpenEthereum? As I understand, there is an equivalent for Arbitrum One: https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum/arbtrace_transaction but it is to be used on blocks prior to 22207815. Is there support for the call on Nova?
undefined says We don’t support openEthereum’s trace way, however, we support geth’s trace way like debug_*
undefined says Thanks for the hint. Could you expand upon what arbtrace_transaction does then? What happened on block 22207815?
undefined says worked great, thanks! now I don't have to resync for a few hours haha 🙂
undefined says arbtrace_* is used for our classic node, not for nitro node.
undefined says And that call has the same effect as traced_transaction for the classic node (by that I assume that you are reffering to Arbitrum One)
undefined says Yup, they are all used to trace tx. And arbitrum one is now based on nitro.
undefined says If you want to trace before-nitro tx, you need run a classic node and then you can just use that way to trace.
undefined says So to paraphrase:
1. Arbitrum One exposed the `arbtrace_transaction` call, which had the same effect as `trace_transaction` up until block `22207815`
2. After block `22207815`,  `arbtrace_transaction`  is no longer supported on Arbitrum One and only geth rpc methods are supported
undefined says And on an unrelated note, https://arbiscan.io/apis does not offer any paid subscription, and there exists only the community endpoint?
undefined says Half correct, if your node is nitro node, it will only accept geth trace way, if your nitro node receives a trace request which needs to trace tx before `22207815` it will redirect to a classic node (You need manually set it) using arbtrace_*, if your node doesn’t connect to a classic node, this request will fail.
If you are running a classic node, it can only serve the tx before 22207815 and only serve arbtrace_*
undefined says Much obliged for a detailed response. So to stay future proof, arbtrace_transaction should be avoided.
undefined says thx
undefined says Hoa to run nitro node now ? Please give hardware required for nitro node.. thanks
undefined says Currently my arbitrum node is already taking up 168G after ~2 months with initial download being smth like 30 gigs so the db grows with like 75G a month! Is there some pruning setting or something to keep this size down because at some point I will run out of space!
undefined says this because i do not necessarily need all the historic data
undefined says there are rumors that there will be a way out of the tightness in the fall, so you don't have to wait long bro
undefined says you mean a more light-ish version?
undefined says no, as I understand it, the processing of the node for new tasks, in connection with the exit from the testnet
undefined says i see, the main thing I was talking about though was that the node size grows quite fast which is a bit annoying when having to deal with this data
undefined says (although <100gb/month isn't too bad, two 1 TB drives and you can do almost 2 year but still!)
undefined says would be nice to have a setting somewhere that prunes the database to a fixed size of X gb
undefined says I understand, wait bro, today I hope the team will answer the question, by the way, mark some of them here
undefined says mark?
undefined says tag
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs do you know this?
undefined says Same as geth.
undefined says What is your node’s version?
undefined says the newest one, v2.0.8 🙂
undefined says it there a command in that newer version to reduce database size on the fly?
undefined says This is a launch event with many attractive rewards, behind a good management team
undefined says Devs, I confirm you that Arbitrum is the faster, easier and most robust L2 I have ever tried until now. Congratulations, this is the winning horse IMO
undefined says Your account has one deposit ETH tx to Arb1: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5cc9ddea26752e51a45d0a30f3085be7deed27d44624d653612a46f28c996d66
Which was successfully executed, here's the L2 hash:
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe49c88b1f8eda2e426bdfff48716fe03d5c2723f9fe2e008051d4607c698c46b
undefined says Holy moly the node snapshot is way too old
undefined says Pls update
undefined says May I know which one you're talking about?
undefined says Nitro mainnet
undefined says Looks like block 25 000 000 from current 35 000 000 ? Or am I mistaken
undefined says The reason is the Arb1 genesis database contains pre-nitro blocks, it does not contain post-nitro blocks whereas Nitro snapshot only contains the post-nitro blocks
undefined says is there any technical documentation on how to set up an Arbitrum node and get access to the monthly node program reward?
undefined says Here's a guide on how to run a node:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says thanks mate! is there a node reward program and are there node slots to join?
undefined says Sooo, how can I find a never snapshot?
undefined says No problem. No there's no such program.
undefined says You could take a look at our guides on running (1) pre-nitro and (2) post-nitro nodes here:
(1) https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-classic-node
(2) https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says "https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says This is the one I used and which is super old
undefined says It takes over a week to sync from that
undefined says thanks!
undefined says is there a plan to have such kind of program in the future?
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/kawaii-rabbit-goodnight-i-luv-u-gif-23433378
undefined says Not for now
undefined says That is the genesis database, it only has pre-nitro blocks
undefined says Well where is the post-nitro snapshot?
undefined says Can I have a link, thanks!
undefined says well https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-nod is for running a nitro node, it has only pre-nitro blocks and takes some time to sync. It’s also a bit old (we don't have newer version atm). How fast you can get it synced probably depends largely on your L1 node connection speed, as well as CPU speed
undefined says Thanks, any chance to get it updated? A week to sync is quite long. I'll see if I can do something to L1 speed
undefined says Sure. We don't have any plan for it just yet
undefined says sudo docker run --rm -it  -v /opt/arbitrum:/home/arb/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.7-10b845c --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" --l1.url=redacted --l2.chain-id=42161 --node.rpc.classic-redirect=redacted --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
undefined says my experience is that Infura works fine for L1 provider and is free! 👍
undefined says Big project
undefined says ✅
undefined says Hey guys. For a project launching on arbitrum, what sort of support is available ?

Anything else to do besides filling this form in? 

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw0U-9LcLuih5TZ_QghS-S_MS4wCKSEigA_IQEza_hFmNVow/viewform
undefined says hey fam, can you actually DM me? happy to get u setup with our partnerships team
undefined says You need set your mount as `/opt/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum`
undefined says Our projects also need some help.
undefined says You can also send email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Can you explain to me how can I interpret finality on Arbitrum? Is it safe for the Sequencer to confirm a transaction or should I wait for L1 to confirm it.
undefined says It depends on your needs, if you have a much high funds related tx, you’d better wait when your tx is confirmed on l1, but if you want a fast confirmation, it’s ok just when you receive the sequencer feedback. It’s more like in Bitcoin-wait when tx confirmed or wait 6 blocks confirmed.
undefined says ❤️
undefined says Thanks for the reply. Could you maybe give examples as to what is the industry standard. For example, if I were to deposit funds on Binance via Arbitrum, would they be visible immediately or would Binance wait for L1 confirmations
undefined says Binance will check if your tx confirmed on l1 then release your token on their cex.
undefined says And is there a crash course on how to check tx confirmation on l1 given that I have the tx on l2
undefined says Yup, we have one, using l2 block to check l1 confirmation: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L71
undefined says And this works on both Arbitrum Classic blocks and on Arbitrum One?
undefined says d
undefined says 4
undefined says After running a successful node where i can send proof
undefined says Any incentive for node runner??
undefined says 😹
undefined says No idinthave idea
undefined says Guys, can you help please? I run a node on Arbitrum Nova, but I don't see how to connect wallet. Can you guide me, please?
undefined says Bro can you tell me how to run node
undefined says I used this documentation: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Can you tell me first step like I have to run on CMD or Elsewhere?
undefined says you just copy  RPC L1 and run docker container. Than follow the instructions in docs with setup required artifacts and parameters
undefined says I have been reading up the documentation and as far as I understand the lifecycle of a transaction, it is not sufficient just to wait for a batch of transactions to be included from L2 to L1, but once it has been included in L1, the dispute period begins, which is around a week. Would this mean, for example, that Binance would wait that the dispute period terminates or would Binance just wait for sufficient L1 confirmations on the batch that was recorder from L2
undefined says Yes. The L2-L1 msg gets included in the assertion and they'd have to wait for ~7 days for the assertion to be confirmed (aka dispute period)
You could take a look at our L2-L1 messaging docs:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging#client-flow
undefined says Can anyone answer my question? How to connect a wallet to my node on Arbitrum Nova? Any instructions and requirements for that?
undefined says What's the best wallet to use in arbitrum?
undefined says Here's a list of wallets you can use:
https://portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says can we fire up validator nodes yet or is it still beta / closed beta ??
undefined says ive been wanting to do this forever...  im pretty experienced with eth l1 nodes (rocketpool) and gnosis chain nodes...  but arbitrum is my home..
undefined says i really want to contribute and and be part of the validator crew...  any direction would be most appreciated
undefined says For now, you can run your own fullnode and watchover validator: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says does anyone know if arbitrum supports ec signatures for crosschain communication?
undefined says we support all the precompiles L1 does (and more), including the `ecrecover` precompile 🙂
undefined says wonderful, im deploying on testnet soon if anyone wants to try to break some things ! 😄  am hoping to use ec sigs from crosschain variables, not entirely sure itll work tho
undefined says d
undefined says why i dont connect ang vertify my wallet
undefined says 
undefined says Does anyone know how to solve this problem, about arb nodes
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I put other keys in the keystore folder and it seems that I can't read them correctly
undefined says Hey gang, I'm new here,and I'm trying to find the abi and contract address to pull in some event datas.  Can anyone point me in the right direction please 🙂
undefined says Contract address: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/useful-addresses , and you can find those contract here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/master/contracts/src
undefined says Find the historical block height, use eth_call to pass in the abi and contract address, and you should be able to get the historical data
undefined says Thank you so very much!
undefined says Take the liberty to ask, can the fullnode you run import the keystore file, or can it create a new address, just like the geth of the mainnet?
undefined says If you are running a fullnode, you don’t need to use your key, because fullnode doesn’t need to sign message, ethereum fullnode also don’t need key, but their validator needs.
undefined says Thank you for your answer, that is to say, the geth of arb's fullnode currently does not include the account management function, right? I need to manage it in other ways, which is different from the geth of the main network.
undefined says You mean use key to interact with arbitrum node?
undefined says Like this: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/managing-your-accounts ?
undefined says I mean I want to use my own private key to sign the transaction and send it to arbitrum network, through my own node, on the mainnet, I used geth's account management function to manage my private key,
undefined says Oh, of course you can do this
undefined says Fullnode has rpc function
undefined says Yes, I have tested other functions, which are roughly the same as the rpc functions of the geth mainnet, but the above error will appear in the account management part
undefined says When I use rpc to call the new address, there will be a prompt like this
undefined says 
undefined says When I use the geth console to enter the full node and execute the geth command, I will get the same prompt
undefined says 
undefined says I confirmed the permissions of the full node file, it should not be a problem of reading and writing
undefined says 
undefined says So I want to ask for help, is it the same problem, or is there something wrong with the way I use it
undefined says Are you running your node using docker or you compile it locally?
undefined says I am using docker to run it
undefined says 
undefined says docker image is offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.8-5b9fe9c
undefined says Got it, will check it and feed back to you.
undefined says Thank you very much for your help and look forward to your reply
undefined says Is anyone here familiar with getting Contract events through websockets?
undefined says When I call `const events = await contract.getPastEvents(` I get a nice full event object
undefined says But when I'm using websockets to view new events in real time, the eent object is missing the `returnValues`
undefined says 
undefined says It has the `[TOPICS]`  and `data` but missing the names key-value pairs of the returnedValues from the other method, maybe I need to pull the transaction hash?
undefined says You can use ethersjs’ decode utils to decode this.
undefined says Thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  One thing I that doesn't add up for me is, the `[TOPICS]` array has 4 values,  where the first `[0]` is just the kcak signature, and the other three are values from the `returnValues`  Yet the screenshot shows there are 6 return values.
undefined says Just try this, might help you: https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/abi/interface/#Interface--decoding
undefined says 
undefined says general question, how can I make my node sync faster? or, is there anyway to get feed from sequencer faster?
undefined says Anyone here running Arbitrum node from source with geth ? any  tutorial to set it up from source (no docker).  no need validator. only http and ws endpoint.
undefined says Two questions:

1. Will snapshots be done more frequently to support faster syncing times when a node does crash? The last snapshot was done 2 months ago.
2. If my node is ended with a SIGKILL promptly the software indicates that the head state is missing and is repairing on the next startup. However, the software does not repair itself as it will be stuck there indefinitely. Can I manually repair the chain database or can I let the node sync from say 1 hour ago?
undefined says i think for now the only way to get it faster is to use the latest snapshot using `--init.url=https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar` but other than that i dont think so! 😦
undefined says Is there an example of a transaction that got challenged and therefore not included on the mainnet? I would like to know how to recognise such a transaction and handle it properly.
undefined says I'm looking for resources on gas differences to L1 Ethereum, particularly the cost of each opcode and the cost per slot of calldata.

I have read that calldata is stored in persistent storage on L1, but I have not found exact costs yet.
undefined says ---

followup, i'm trying to script this in foundry. any reason this code may succeed on mainnet but not on aribtrum? it deploys a contract that does nothing but `return(0, 0)` and calls it with a few different payloads.

https://gist.github.com/jtriley-eth/bd7f8c17088f64417042322e4e53d331
undefined says I can't trade with réseau Arbitrum Nova in zigzag exchange !!
undefined says My swap in hashflow is failed
Transaction Hash: 0x9799a019af2dea3d4d6a9e283d007e0de9e7eaf8e08353ca473e676c797490bb
undefined says 1. At this point we do not have plans to update our snapshot more frequently
2. You should try to gracefully stop the node with SIGINT instead of SIGKILL, our newer nitro-node release  may have improved repairing corrupted database but if the auto repair doesn’t work you would need to sync from beginning again. If you have a lot of storage, running in archive mode should eliminate the issue
undefined says okay thanks, that is clear! Yes i always try to do a SIGTERM or SIGINT and give the process time before SIGKILL but for more non-predictable occurrences some way of repairing instead of resyncing is nice but thanks for the answer! 🙂
undefined says An attacker tried to make a malicious assertion on ETHW last week which one our team members @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs could defend against as he was running a defensive validator. He explains the details here in this twitter thread:
https://twitter.com/PlasmaPower0/status/1588206033654145024?s=20&t=RaUC5xVH75DItjHUAvfFtA
undefined says It's not really an apple to apple comparison as it depends on the entire calldata of your tx posted on L1, we use Brotli compression algorithm to compress the data before positing it on L1, so it depends on how compressable the calldata is
undefined says What affects compressibility? I'm not familiar with brotli.

Do you have links to any benchmarks or tests with this in the context of eth calldata?
undefined says hey, can't find an answer to this but how was this account able to send ETH when there are no inbound txs for the ETH it sent out originally? https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeca9d75cad6266fbdeaca0a0e74487097028a46c
undefined says does someone know, how to create coin on arbitrum ? please give me a doc or something thanks !
undefined says do you know what/when/if 'whitelisting' will occur and what criteria will need to be met ?  will performance of a 'watchtower' node be used to evaluate whitelisting ?
undefined says and thank you for the time and info mr jasonwan 🙂
undefined says ps. it's 'watchtower' - i looked at the docs.
undefined says Hi,arbitrum developer here? Is there document how to run nova node?
undefined says `--l1.url=<Layer 1 Ethereum RPC URL>`
Does this have to be an archive node? or will full node work
undefined says full node works
undefined says those two transactions are deposit transactions. The account you've linked is the L2 mapped representation of the L1 account, so the funds actually came from L1
undefined says You can see the deposits of 1 and 1.05 ether on the L1 side of the receiver here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xDb98d75Cad6266FBDEaca0a0E74487097028935b
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs Is arbitrum having some struggles right now?
undefined says no everything is up as far as I've seen
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Thank you ser, appreciate it 🙏
undefined says awesome thanks, I take it for a Nova node it would just be the chain ID change?
same image
undefined says yep, and no genesis db is needed as it wasn't migrated from a classic chain
undefined says the nitro repo has a working import of our geth
undefined says test...
undefined says 
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs is there a flag to specify the data directory , the chain data
or it simply goes in whats mounted as persistent storage ex:
`volumes:
            - '/home/glc/arbitrum-node/data/:/arbitrum-node/data/'    `
undefined says you can ignore the arbitrum legacy tx. it's only used for pre-nitro blocks and cannot be submitted anymore. The signedTx you have could be submitted however
undefined says yes you can't submit these directly on L2, otherwise you could just submit a tx as anyone without a signature! ArbitrumUnsignedTx must be submitted via the L1 bridge from the unaliased account on L1
undefined says `--persistent.global-config` and `--persistent.chain` (those will modify where it is within docker, you can then mount it to wherever out of docker)
undefined says great thanks,
undefined says how do we connect to our own l1 url.  I keep getting errors, using this format
`--l1.url=https://<IP>:8545/`
also running local ETH node on a separate device and allowed incoming from my arbitrum node IP over that port
undefined says this is how to run nitro node.
undefined says it's not  doc to run nova node!!
undefined says just change Chain ID to Nova ID:42170, and no genesis db is needed
undefined says thanks
undefined says you probably need `http://` not `https://`
undefined says great thanks,
undefined says nice tomeet you
undefined says Question, is it possible be the first to call a method in L2?

Suppose an L2 contract has a method foo() which anyone can call but will revert prior to block.timestamp = X on L2. Is there a way to be the first to call it with really high probability?
undefined says Based on my reading I'm thinking you would have to submit a tx in delayed inbox 24 hours prior to block.timestamp = x. and then maybe submit a tx to flashbots on L1 that calls forceInclusion when the block.timestamp = x (guaranteeing at least first in the block in L1). 

but what block.timestamp would be used for L2 in this approach?
undefined says Based on the example from the Time in Arbitrum doc it says L2 block numbers are synced with L1 approximately every minute. So given the below, assuming forceInclusin happens on L1 on block 1001, would that mean L2 would use the block.timestamp from 1000 or 1004 when it is synced? 

L1:  ------1000-------1001------1002-------1003-------1004
L2:  ------1000------1000------1000------1000-------1004
undefined says Second question, can a delayed inbox tx be included by sequencer before I call forceInclusion even if I don't want it to? I'm thinking if I don't create a retryable ticket it won't get redeemed by the sequencer
undefined says timestamp now doesn’t sync from l1, however, it is sequencer’s local time.
undefined says In almost all the case, when you send tx to delayed inbox, sequencer will include your tx within 20 minutes.
undefined says I use web3.js on the eth chain to interact with the arbitrum one, is there any difference in the code?
undefined says 11
undefined says can dev do something?
undefined says what is the difference between arbitrum one and arbitrum nova?
undefined says Hey gang.  Developer question here:  How to I get Deposit events?  I get Borrow events from the Pool, but I think I also need Deposit events
undefined says here is the Pool abi I'm using which has no Deposit event http://api.polygonscan.com/api?module=contract&action=getabi&address=0xdf9e4abdbd94107932265319479643d3b05809dc&format=raw
undefined says Apparently it's called `Supply`
undefined says Is there any code sample for web3.js to interact with arbitrum goerli？
undefined says Arbitrum have v2 uniswap or v3?
undefined says 
undefined says You can check it directly on the uniswap website. Currently supported is v3
undefined says does anyone know a randomization feature that can be used on Arbitrum. Apperently Chainlink is not Arbitrum yet. Found another randomizer - Randomizer.ai. but they are still in testnet version too. And I heard doing it off chain is kind of risky. Does any one have some insights on alternative options pls
undefined says even if I don't use a retryable?
undefined says What time is sequencer local time when it comes from delayed inbox? I.e. suppose the batching is occuring every 10 minutes starting at 12:00 and I forceInclusion at 12:05. The next sequencer batch is at 12:10. Does the sequencer monitor the inbox and execute at 12:05 or at 12:10 when it's next batch of transactions are submitted?
undefined says nova is more of a side chain for games and things like Reddit than arb1, which is for the mainstream use
undefined says there aren't too many projects on Nova right now, mostly just Reddit
undefined says Really
undefined says I got this working with my own node, using http not https 
Also because I'm using rocketpool, turns out you also needed to expose the port from the smart node stack not just with firewall
undefined says the birdge is very fast in connex network 

good work

0x90d6f4b42e6ceca46e0d38a775aca8b2efdf1ab10c0f4582e084f13d9949443d
undefined says Hey all.  I was wondering if there is a way to determine the timestamp for events when querying for past events?
undefined says I found an API to get time stamps for certain blockNumber, but some protocals have like 10k blocks a day or more, so not really an option
undefined says Can I ask how this is going?
undefined says Seems we currently don’t support this.
undefined says Yup, if you use sendL2Message, sequencer will also include your message within 20 minutes.
undefined says We have ethersjs way which may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says When you start your docker node, use local net ip instead of 127.0.0.1 to connect to your l1 node.
undefined says Yup, that also works
undefined says I thought the best way is use timestamp to get the nearest block number then use that number to query.
undefined says Will there be plans to support it in the future? This feels like a relatively basic function.
undefined says Yup, we should support it in the future.
undefined says thanks
undefined says Thanks   So If get all events from latest block back 100,000 blocks, and I get a list of events (say 1,000) but no timestamps associated.  Are you saying I should start with a known block, and then get events from said block?
undefined says Not only `fromBlock`, you can also set `toBlock`, so this can avoid you get too much results.
undefined says —ws.addr=0.0.0.0
undefined says Np
undefined says You can just open those important ports: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#important-ports
undefined says Ah, so you don’t want to use your rpc out of your local network? If so, you can just close it.
undefined says Are you running relay?
undefined says If not, no need to open it.
undefined says Ok, no need to open it.
undefined says If you want to run more than one node, you can run an relay node.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#arb-relay
undefined says ok
undefined says good project
undefined says Thanks for the answer! Could you elaborate what happens with a transaction that gets rejected? Is it still included in the block explorer? How does it look like?
undefined says If your tx reverted, it will show on arbiscan and change your account’s nonce, if your tx rejected due to low gas price or others(ie wrong signature), it won’t show on arbiscan and won’t change your account nonce.
undefined says Hello! My name is Alex, I am a Growth Lead at Allbridge 

Since the mainnet launch, we've bridged over $6.3B.

Recently we launched our new product Allbridge Core - cross-chain stableswap platform on Etherum, BNB chain, Tron and Solana.

As we know Circle plans to deploy USDC on Arbitrum chain at the end of 2022 or 1Q of 2023.

Our bridge supports only native stablecoins and we are waiting for official USDC deployment on Arbitrum. We want to join Arbitrum ecosystem by adding USDC to our bridge when it will be deployed officially.

We would like to know more about marketing and liquidity support for protocols.

Who should I talk to?
undefined says Hey, Alex, what a wonderful bridge, nice to have you join our ecosystem! You can send an email to our partnerships team, then we will contact you: partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Thank you. I just sent an email from al@allbridge.io
undefined says Does the same apply for a transaction that got rejected due to the challenge period? Is there any trace left in the chain of the transaction that got removed as was described in this: https://twitter.com/PlasmaPower0/status/1588206033654145024?s=20&t=RaUC5xVH75DItjHUAvfFtA post
undefined says transaction won’t be rejected by challenge if it is legal, the reject thing is the state, someone may use the same transaction but compute to the different state, so we need challenge to find the right one.
undefined says So the transaction that caused the computation of an illegal state is still recorded on L2?
undefined says We will find which state should be if we execute this transaction. For example, there is state A, then we have tx1, someone execute as follows: state A->tx1->state B, while others: state A->tx1->state C, so we should use challenge to find which validator choose to cheat.
undefined says So to paraphrase, there is no illegal transaction, but an illegal state transition. From the perspective of a transaction, it is always tx1 that is recorded on L2
undefined says If someone use illegal transaction (use wrong signature or wrong nonce or others), the tx will reject directly by sequencer
undefined says And even if sequencer record it, others node will choose to ignore it. Same in challenge.
undefined says So good
undefined says Good morning everyone guys, one question ...

As for BRC-SYN-MYC tokens and others, can I exchange them by simply pasting the contract on Uniswap or Sushi? even if I get the warning? have you done that too?

Thank you all.
undefined says Also, if you send legal transaction to our sequencer and recorded on l1, you don’t need to worry your transaction will be canceled any more.(Unless l1 reorg)
undefined says What the warn is? You should make sure you use right address and your gas is enough.
undefined says Yes dude thanks, no problem with gas, the address is taken from CoinMarketCup, I think everything is ok then?
undefined says You should see what is the warning is, if it is due to low liquidity, your tx may fail.
undefined says good night
undefined says Thanks for the answer! Could you elaborate what happens with a transaction that gets rejected? Is it still included in the block explorer? How does it look like?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Revisiting this example again: There is state A, then we have tx1, someone execute as follows: state A->tx1->state B, while others: state A->tx1->state C. I am an  honest node, sending tx2, assuming that an honest state is state C (while it is not). What happens in my world view is:

A->tx1->state C->tx2 -> state D.

But what is honest is:
A->tx1->state B->tx2 -> state E.

Meaning after the dispute period ends, the final state will be:
A->tx1->state B->tx2 -> state E.

And tx1 and tx2 will be recorded on chain, and final as soon as they are included in L1. It is only the state that has changed. Could you confirm that my understanding is correct?
undefined says Yup, once the tx recorded on l1, there must be and only be a right state, and we can confirm that right state after fraud proof windows.
undefined says Please do not spam, if there is another time, you will be banned.
undefined says So the harm for me as a bystander is that I am basically executing tx2 believing that I will end up in state D but will end up in state E
undefined says So you need to make sure your preorder state is correct, which is why we recommend node operators to sync from genesis blocks instead of snapshots

undefined says Looking for a react front end dev to work on an interesting project being built on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Kindly send a friend request if you’d be interested in hearing it out🙏🏻
undefined says Below is the receipt for the following tx hash: 0x73c5baa41bde7a082c94acfc2645e6fa3a2062fe5c66614e71447f40d4f8b406

How is it the case that the `gasUsed` is exactly equal to the `gasUsedForL1`? I thought all transactions had an L1 fee and an L2 fee. How does this one seemingly not have an L2 fee?

```json
{
   "jsonrpc":"2.0",
   "id":0,
   "result":{
      "transactionHash":"0x73c5baa41bde7a082c94acfc2645e6fa3a2062fe5c66614e71447f40d4f8b406",

}
```
undefined says @🚀f8 🚀 | Team 20% You’re actually paying for two things at once when using Arbitrum one: L1-native resources and L2-native resources. The L1 resources you’re paying for are essentially just Ethereum calldata; i.e., you pay the size in raw data of your transaction times the L2’s view of the L1 calldata price. The L2 resources you need to pay for are whatever computation your transaction is doing in Arbitrum’s general-purpose VM — execution, writing to storage, etc. 

From what I can see in Arbiscan, nothing was computed/stored on L2 in your tx (it was a simple transfer.)
That explains why the total gasUsed is equal to the gasUsedForL1:
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x73c5baa41bde7a082c94acfc2645e6fa3a2062fe5c66614e71447f40d4f8b406#txninfo
undefined says In this simple transfer, there _is_ an l2 fee. Do you know why the first simple transfer did not have a fee but this one does? I'm not sure if it is a coincidence, but the `gasUsedForL1 - gasUsed` equals 21k exactly (the cost of a transfer on l1)

undefined says Hello! Is there a L1 contract method to calculate `maxSubmissionCost`? 🤔
undefined says Not from the sdk
undefined says I saw your tx happens on our classic version, in classic, eth transfer doesn’t count computational gas.

undefined says nice to meet you guys

undefined says Love
undefined says Sry, I'm browsing the erc20_arbitrum.evt_transfer on Dune
undefined says I see the index numer for arbitrum events going as high as 37 in my query
undefined says I know the number of logs is limited to 4 on ethereum
undefined says is this not the case here?
undefined says Arbitrum is evm compatible, so we are the same as ethereum, however, someone may implement different erc20, so it depends. But most erc20 token on arbitrum follows the standard way.
undefined says ty
undefined says ok
undefined says got it, it was the number of the events/logs not the topics
undefined says sry I was confused
undefined says I would like to clarify the sum total of fees an end user must pay on Arbitrum Classic / Arbitrum One. Example transactions:
* Arbitrum Classic: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe8648e3ad982a3d67ef0880d6631343cffff364786994b34e5fa292cfef0e680 (0.00009041241447 ETH)
* Arbitrum One: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x7ed27b9915cc27d8234f71aa25a5a3ab20dde7ab08b70df947d8a8d153d74f01 (0.0000211817 ETH )

In both instances (and in the protocol in general, not just these two transactions), the sum total of submitting transactions is as displayed by Arbiscan? No additional fees need to be paid by the user for these transactions?
undefined says Furthermore, some transaction types on receipts are marked as 0x78. To the best of my knowledge, there only exists 0x1 and 0x2. Is there a document outlining the meaning behind this number?
undefined says Yes that's all users have to pay, no additional fee
undefined says In Arbitrum, we used non-standard EIP-2718 typed transaction to handle different types of transactions. (Eg ArbitrumLegacyTxType = 120). You could find more here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/geth#transaction-types
undefined says Also, these are tx types we have:
`ArbitrumDepositTxType         = 100
ArbitrumUnsignedTxType        = 101
ArbitrumContractTxType        = 102
ArbitrumRetryTxType           = 104
ArbitrumSubmitRetryableTxType = 105
ArbitrumInternalTxType        = 106
ArbitrumLegacyTxType          = 120`

undefined says thanks for your answer, I don't know for sure if it's a real security issue or a misunderstanding on my part. Just to be sure, could you clarify the purpose of 0xA4b000000000000000000073657175656e636572 ? Thanks!
undefined says That's the batch poster address
undefined says When you submit transactions to the sequencer, that account does the work of posting your txes (kinda, it represents the sequencer doing it on L1)
undefined says but it doesnt do it for all the blocks?
undefined says It's not the coinbase for delayed messages
undefined says But yeah, most blocks will have that address
undefined says Is there a gateway that supports `inboundEscrowAndCall`?
undefined says okay, so it wasn't a security issue but more a misleading UI on arbiscan
For example, this wallet https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5afa6e255ba418d08e66c35b588e2f2f3766f2e1 looked like it minted eth out of nowhere but if I understood correctly, it was a delayed message. That was also the reason why the block.miner was set to it's own adress and not 0xA4b. Thanks for your time!
undefined says I don’t think we have a gateway supports this now

undefined says I noticed that Arbitrum Classic / Arbitrum One has a total of 109 precompiles deployed as of today. While I do plan on diving in and doing my own research, could someone confirm for me that L2 applications would work out of the box, and do not contain a change that influences the L2 applications like defi. My intuition tells me that it does not.
undefined says hey arbitrum is centralized and permissioned currently, right? https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum/
undefined says How would I then reliably calculate a transaction fee from a eth_getTransactionReceipt response prior to Nitro. For example, the below transaction:

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe8648e3ad982a3d67ef0880d6631343cffff364786994b34e5fa292cfef0e680#txninfo

undefined says Just found this tx is our classic version tx(pre-nitro), so you can use transaction receipt’s that way to calculate, but after nitro, it would be ok.
undefined says Thanks for the response, but I am not sure I understand your statement. By what means could I calculate these values?
undefined says The sequencer is running by us, but if you don’t trust us, you can still send your tx to delayed inbox rather than sequencer, your tx can still be executed.
undefined says Tx after block 22207818
undefined says We have made a upgrade to our network around that time which we changed to a new tech stack .
undefined says I understand that, and that is the reason I chose this transaction (a transaction explicitly before Nitro). The problem I am trying to solve is how to calculate the transaction fee prior to Nitro using these raw responses
undefined says Forclassic node, eth_getTransactionReceipt has `feeStats`, this field was what we used to calculate classic’s tx gas fee. But after nitro, our new node doesn’t have that field anymore.
undefined says Meaning I can query a classic node the same RPC call and then get the feeStats. Given that I have the feeStats, how would I calculate the transaction fee using that value?
undefined says There is 4 sub fields in `feedStats`, that is what you saw on arbiscan, just sum them up is ok.
undefined says So the solution to my problem is to query classic nodes for eth_getTransactionReceipt for every block prior to 22207815, in which case I would find the `feeStats` instead of querying post Nitro nodes?
undefined says Yup
undefined says Much appreciated. And excuse me in advance for being inquisitive, but could you comment on my other question as well:
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1039819662642393088
undefined says I think this docs may help you: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/solidity-support
undefined says Okay, not totally related but do you guys think DeFi has a future? Or it's better a Hybrid De-CeFi like what you guy's (and many other chains, including BNB, Tron,...) 
doing currently?
undefined says Hi! In the same way you have a method on the L2 precompile for calculating L1 gas costs, do you have one on a L1 contract for calculating L2 gas costs or the L2 basefee? 

Looked in Inbox/Outbox.sol but didn't find any. Thanks!
undefined says L1 contracts don't know L2 side gas price, etc simply because they don't have access. But you can get this number offchain using our SDK
undefined says Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to minimize any offchain tasks to the minimum, to 0 if possible
undefined says Well that's infeasible
One area of minimization (for sending L1-L2 msg) would be to get the submission fee through our inbox but we cant get other L2 gas related numbers using our L1 contracts
(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/f092fa566b1b92f1813254a402029e9de6316f6a/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L332)
undefined says That's exactly what I'm trying to do haha getting that L2 cost onchain somehow...but had to ask you guys first if by any chance you had a method there hidden under your sleeves
undefined says merme
undefined says Did you find anything? I would love to run the node without docker too
undefined says A sanity check, do Arbitrum One / Arbitrum Classic / Arbitrum Nova all use EIP-1559?
undefined says Yes. All our chains support both legacy transactions and typed transactions
undefined says This is true since the genesis block on Arbitrum Classic?
undefined says Sorry I was actually wrong.
Arbitrum classic only supports legacy transactions while Arbitrum One and Nova support both legacy and typed txs :arbiblobblue:
undefined says Can we get some better verification on the discord? I swear like 99% of this place is all bots it’s absolutely awful
undefined says Just to be sure that I understand exactly what Arbitrum Classic and Arbitrum One are:
* All blocks prior to 22207815 -> Arbitrum Classic, no Nitro, legacy transactions (no EIP-1559)?
* All blocks after and including 22207815 -> Arbitrum One, Nitro, EIP-1559?
undefined says That's correct
undefined says Can anyone please pick me to documentation that covers hardware and bandwidth requirements for running a full node on arbi one? Couldn't find it after some googling and digging into the repo
undefined says hello! I've built arb-node binary, when trying to run it with --l1.url=xxx --node.chain-id=421613 (on goerli testnet) I get an error: connected to unrecognized ethereum network with chain ID: 5 
Any idea what could be the issue?
undefined says Same as geth
undefined says What is your l1.url point to? Is it goerli network?
undefined says what about state size + rate of state growth vs geth on L1?
undefined says 165gb on November 7th, around 40-50gb/month.
undefined says Is the IncomingMessage.go file the entry point for the sequencer to receive and process L2 transactions? I guess every L2 transaction starts here.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/4ac7e9268e9885a025e0060c9ec30f9612f9e651/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L54
undefined says This is used to process the message comes from l1 inbox.
undefined says How does the sequencer receive and process L2 transactions?
undefined says " If a user is posting a “standard” Arbitrum transaction (i.e., interacting with an L2 native dapp), the user will submit the signed transaction directly to the Sequencer, much like how a user submits a transaction to an Ethereum node when interacting with L1. Upon receiving it, the Sequencer will execute it and nearly instantaneously deliver the user a receipt. Some short time later — usually no more than a few minutes — the Sequencer will include the user’s transaction in a batch and post it on L1 by calling one of the SequencerInbox’s addSequencerL2Batch methods. "

The above is the description of the sequencer in the official document. I am very interested in the workflow of the sequencer, so I want to know how the sequencer handles the transaction. At the same time, I guess the addSequencerL2BatchFromOrigin method in the SequencerInbox contract is called in the batch_poster.go file to publish the bulk packaged transaction on L1.
undefined says We also use geth-core, so the sequencer will use geth to compute the tx. So you can see our forked-geth repo is ok: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/4ac7e9268e9885a025e0060c9ec30f9612f9e651/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L54
undefined says Yes l1.url points to goerli geth node
undefined says Is that url your own node or public endpoint?
undefined says I tried both. My own geth node and ankr rpc - same issue: connected to unrecognized ethereum network with chain ID: 5
undefined says Can you share me the full start command? You can also dm me this.
undefined says anyone here would let me acces to his node for some reseacher ? Thanks
undefined says I don't know why but "h", "i" is blocked.

Btw, if I want to query eth_getBalance for the first block, then I have to run a classic node, right?
undefined says That's right
undefined says Thx! Then may I know which blocks are pre-nitro?
undefined says All blocks prior to 22207815 are Arbitrum Classic
undefined says okey
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs excuse me for the explicit tag, I wanted to link my previous discussion. Are you aware of a data provider that offers nodes such that the `feeStats` field is present in the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` response?
undefined says got it, so about the same as L1 geth
undefined says anyone here would let me acces to his node for some reseacher ? Thanks
undefined says Hey, there's no such provider. Post Nitro, Arbitrum transaction receipts return data about gas in a new format; receipts will have gasUsed (total) and gasUsedForL1 fields (instead of the `feeStats` field in Arbitrum classic).
undefined says Thank you for the response. How can I calculate the transaction fee for a transaction prior to Nitro using `eth_getTransactionReceipt`?
undefined says Sure! For every tx prior to Nitro, `eth_getTransactionReceipt` would return the `feeStats`  which contains 4 subfields, you'd need to sum them up for the total tx fee
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says For some reason I can not send a raw json response and get warned as a spammer. In the example I can not send, those fields do not exist in the response
undefined says Hash: 0x11f94a5ca2f13fd50f1b35fce5796c8844a7333fe64ac94da0378f483c4a7d7f
undefined says Can you see the `feeStats` field? That's the tx fee
undefined says 
undefined says You need to run a classic node to get `feeStats` for txs before Nitro. Non of providers provide classic node. In this example your tx's fee is what `gasUsed` shows
undefined says So if I understand correctly, the only way would be for me to actually spin up a classic node myself?
undefined says Yes if you want to get the `feeStats` field
undefined says Can you perhaps think of a simpler way of fetching the transaction fee given a hash?
undefined says Well you can use `eth_getTransactionReceipt` and then get the tx fees using either the `gasUsed` or the `feeStats` depending on which node you're running
that's the easiest way
undefined says how do run node
undefined says can you show guide
undefined says yes
undefined says uhm
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/useful-addresses
undefined says thanks
undefined says where can buy good VPS?
undefined says You can search this on google to see others comments for better.
undefined says ok
undefined says When did run node ?
undefined says You can run our node whenever you want.
undefined says Can you share me the first day run node?
undefined says Our mainnet started on 2021, August 31th
undefined says oke
undefined says is the storage per contract for arbitrum also limited to 24kb like eth l1?
undefined says yes
undefined says Thank you. Is the block size limit the same too?
undefined says roughly yes
undefined says I think it's something like 32 million on arbitrum one right now?
undefined says I think the ArbGasInfo contract lets you get this information
undefined says Appreciate it 💪
undefined says Is it possible to recover USDC funds sent on arbitrum to kraken mistakingly to the mainnet address?
undefined says Hi! Do you have any function on a L1 contract that queries anything about the state of arb L2? Or any way -onchain- of knowing in L1 anything about the state of the nitro chain (not specific contracts) (that doesn't take a week for settlement)?
undefined says I am afraid not, you need ask kraken to see if they can send it back to you, because only they have that key.
undefined says You mean query l2’s state from l1? We don’t have that function since they are different network.
undefined says But you have `nodeInterface` on L2 that queries L1 state and they're diff networks :/
undefined says Curious that you don't have the other way around. That'd be extremely helpful 🙂
undefined says But that can not query l1’s contract state or l1 account’s information, and we implement `nodeInterface` in our node.
undefined says What state you want to query from l1?
undefined says please check my dm when you have the time
undefined says Replied
undefined says Initially, L2 gas price but I was already told by one of you guys that's not possible. So now I'm looking for any piece of info on L1 from L2. Anything at all that might tell me anything in L1 about L2 state
undefined says Is there a source for on chain RNG on Arb One?
undefined says Well, we have rollups contract and you can call for some rollups node information there: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L91
undefined says And node information is: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/Node.sol

undefined says Hey guys! Is it possible to test Arbitrum with the local environment (truffle)? Because, there is a note (on https://github.com/truffle-box/arbitrum-box) about local testing: "Arbitrum is currently changing how running a local Arbitrum node works...", but this was committed almost a year ago.
undefined says Suler
undefined says Are there any rewards/incentives for new defi users like myself to run a arb node? Flux, for example, pays its node users a % based on the size of the flux tied up in the node. Any resources would be helpful. Thank you.
undefined says Super
undefined says Perfect
undefined says 👍
undefined says hey all
undefined says really noob question here sry
undefined says but does ethers.js work if you're trying to monitor/interact with arbitrum contracts?
undefined says 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
undefined says 👍
undefined says Don’t think so
undefined says It works, arbitrum is evm-compatible.
undefined says There is no rewards to run a node on arbitrum.
undefined says We still don’t provide any docs to run a local blockchain, but if you want, you can see this bash: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash
undefined says Thank you king
undefined says 👍
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  Whether there is any way to get the seed nodes is not a question for arbitrum. But it is also the evm chain
undefined says You mean use arbitrum node to sync other evm chain’s state?
undefined says I'm talking about the boot node
undefined says Ah, got it, yup, seed state is a key point to safety sync the state.
undefined says So sync from genesis will better compare to snapshot.
undefined says Hey do we have more infos about how to run an arbitrum node? Is there only a docker image? If so, what should be the flag? Can it run by itself or does it need an execution or consensus node
undefined says I am trying to build something cross chain message.
Is there any way to simulate cross chain env locally? Something like hardhat or other tools ?
undefined says please check https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says You can also see this script, here is how to compile the node: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/53f068afa975d71746854ad86484fb43de20ebab/Dockerfile
undefined says are you using any node providers there are a few tutorials about that
undefined says We have example on how to send cross chain message: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter
undefined says Do you mean something like infura ?
undefined says I saw this before, seems like that it test on testnet directly instead of using local env to test ?
undefined says it can be used  to run on both testnet and mainnet, but if you want to test local env, I thought you may need to run a local arbitrum network, it would be difficult.
undefined says can you check my dm
undefined says Responsed
undefined says Got it. Thanks
undefined says Recommend test it on testnet directly, that would be the real environment to run your dapp.
undefined says Got it.
undefined says Do I need to have an geth node on L1 to run arbitrum node ? 
+ on the doc “Arbitrum One Nitro Genesis Database Snapshot

Use the parameter --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" “

Where do you pass this init url? On the docker?
undefined says wen LINK VRF?
undefined says Soooo. How do I start the node without it killing itself on exit?
undefined says Considering syncin takes weeks because the snapshot is ancient, the docker run --rm is quite dangerous
undefined says Everytime the server is restarted I have to wait two weeks to get my node up
undefined says nvm found really good docker-compose instructions for this.
undefined says what is the difference between the `Gateway Router` contract and `Custom Gateway` ?
undefined says where can I find their high level purpose?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/asset-bridging#custom-gateway-functionality found it here i think
undefined says why does USDC require a custom gateway though? hmm
undefined says I'm trying to deploy a simple contract using Hardhat to Arbitrum Goerli testnet just to test contract deployment. I can deploy this contract to other testnets without any issues. But the same deployment script fails when the network is switched to Arbitrum Goerli with an `Http Provider Error`.. Any ideas?
undefined says xlinq
undefined says hey guys just a quick doubt here
undefined says anybody knows the rate limit for this public rpc? `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`
undefined says do not know but its failing me sometimes
undefined says what tool generates these flows?
undefined says how much storage space does it take to run an arbitrum classic node as in https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node ?
undefined says what is the best bridge from ARB to ETH?
undefined says Figured this out. It was because the gas price was too low. Weird error though
undefined says You can see them there: https://portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says For now, it take up to 200gb, you need prepare more than this for future running.
undefined says 800 requests/min or 400 requests in 10 seconds.
undefined says Which rpc do you use?
undefined says Because they might need to deploy their token on l2 themself, use standard way will deploy by our bridge, but I am not so sure about this.
undefined says tks 👍🏻
undefined says Hmm, what version is your node?
undefined says You can also use 3rd party l1 rpc. That url is used when you first start your node
undefined says thank you
undefined says how How can i move funds from arbitrum nova to arbitrum?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says I would recommend you to use 3rd party bridge since using official bridge needs you to transfer your funds to l1 first, you can find those 3rd party bridge here: https://portal-nova.arbitrum.io
undefined says good
undefined says It is the latest but a tutorial with docker-compose file saved the day
undefined says good
undefined says Why, when withdrawing funds from the Arbitrum network to the mainet network, the funds go as much as 8 days?
undefined says What is your start command? Does it include `init.url` ?
undefined says It is because fraud proof period: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#resolving-disputes-using-interactive-fraud-proofs
undefined says Do the fees on Arbiscan UI also include L1 fees?
undefined says I.e., the displayed value is the sum total of L1 + L2?
undefined says Yeah I first used the whole command from official guide. Including the --rm --it -v tags
undefined says Thanks for this
undefined says Hey what specs does a server running an arbitrum node require? like ram, cores and storage
undefined says When will Arbitrum usdc be available on binance?
undefined says Its same as geth
undefined says Hey, I wanted to get in touch with developers working on arbitrum sub-graphs or the data pipeline. I had worked on the arbitrum hackathon in Bogota on a bounty (won a hidden prize), wanted to continue working on it, and understand some of the problems the team faces currently with graph/data infra..
undefined says You should not include `init.url` the second time since it will sync from the genesis rather than use your current databases.
undefined says Anything I can help?
undefined says Thanks! Would be cool to add a command for normal operations to the guide also. Not just the first start.
undefined says r
undefined says Will keeping this nft be rewarded in the future?
undefined says I am studying about cross chain message, and i got a stupid question.
If i send a tx to  CreateRetryableTicket in L1,  my L2 destination contract will receive this message automatically ? Or i need to do something on L2 to redeem it ?
undefined says please follow #✅︱roles for the update
undefined says also #🚀︱odyssey-faq
undefined says please check this https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging about redeeming: 
> A retryable is submitted via the Inbox's createRetryableTicket method. In the common case, a Retryable's submission is followed by an attempt to execute the transaction (i.e., an "auto-redeem"). If the attempt fails or isn't scheduled after the Retryable is submitted, anyone can try to redeem it, by calling the redeem method of the ArbRetryableTx precompile.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 
My db is 289GB now, is automatically prune enabled?
Run command is same as official doc.
```
docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.8-5b9fe9c --l1.url https://l1-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=<L2ChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```
undefined says Did you try restart your node?
undefined says I have already restarted it. What is your db size now?
undefined says If your gas set enough, it will automatically redeem, but if not, you need redeem it manually.

undefined says I want to ask how do I create das? With docker image already running nitro node.https://developer.arbitrum.io/das/daserver-instructions#create-das-deployment-1 According to what the document says
undefined says рш

undefined says я подключила дискорд, а роли на сайте получить не могу, помогите пожалуйста
undefined says #✅︱roles & #💙start-here🧡
undefined says Do you want to run mirror mode?
undefined says this channel is only for dev related questions please don't spam @nastya357
undefined says я все сделала и у меня в дискорде есть роли но на сайте они не отображаются почему то
undefined says ок
undefined says Tbh, I am not running it, but it should be around your number, you can restart it to automatically prune.
undefined says Yes, I understand that the data can only be read in mirror mode, because I cannot get the data by running nitro node in docker image.
undefined says May I ask what kind of data you want to get?
undefined says Feed data?
undefined says yes
undefined says If you just want to get feed data, you can directly get it by `wscat -c wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`, if you want arbitrum’s state, running fullnode you can also get them.
undefined says I set this parameter in the docker startup command, so how do I get it next
undefined says I mean feed data can be subscribed by that url. But if you still want to run das(das only for nova not arbitrum one), did you set k8s environment?
undefined says I didn’t quite understand, they took my role away from me?
undefined says Please check in #✅︱roles
undefined says guys, i can't find proper instructions for the airdrop. is there a place that I can start with to get these roles on guild.xyz arbitrum?
undefined says feee
undefined says Thanks, but it is just the sequencer node. Is there an easy way to deploy arbitum's contracts on local ganache chain? Or how is the development going in local?
undefined says A quick sanity check related to Arbitrum One. When calculating the transaction fee using a transaction receipt, gasUsed*effectiveGasPrice also includes L2 cost?
undefined says I bought the nft 19 days ago, but now I was surprised that it was not in my wallet. The nft was returned to the seller.
undefined says The easiest way to do this is forking the live network to your local. (Foundry or hardhat)
undefined says Yup
undefined says Can you share the transaction hash that you bought the nft?
undefined says 0xe1aac6b60ef1d426910c1d84956de44432b0c06f6def72836d59b439f627906d
undefined says Is your address 0x73bc64f928629ec285439ebe82ff8414b9e3bcaa? The nft still in your wallet
undefined says If das is only used for nova, then I don't think I need to run das. I subscribed to this url in the docker command, as shown in the following figure. What should I do next to get the status of l2 transaction on l1.
undefined says Just subscribe the feed data can not make sure your tx be recorded on l1, to check your tx on l1, you can call this precompile function: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L71
undefined says If you want to proof your tx recorded on l1, you can run a fullnode and  not connect to sequencer.(Sync from l1’s calldata directly)
undefined says I see, thank you for your guidance, How much space does the whole node take up?
undefined says 250gb-300gb, currently, you need to prepare more because the state is increasing
undefined says 0x73bc64F928629eC285439EbE82Ff8414b9e3BcAA yessir! This is my wallet but It is not in my wallet, and it also appears to me that it is still in the seller's possession
undefined says This might a front end issue, you can see it on arbiscan, it’s in your wallet.
undefined says any admin can help please
undefined says When using the addsequencerL2Batchfromorigin , one of the input is bytes calldata data. How does Arbitrum compress the transaction's calldata?
undefined says I bought Odyssey NFT, but why is Arbinaut role still not accumulating ok?
undefined says how does nitro compress the calldata with brotli
undefined says You can see how we extract data from sequencer inbox and here is way to decompress also: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbstate/inbox.go#L89
undefined says me too!!!
undefined says I don’t know much about the guild role, but it might be you should complete this task rather than have that nft, but not sure.
undefined says How does the Sequencer get information about the delay-inbox? Subscribng?
undefined says is there any grant program on arbitrum? the speech is not about bug bounty etc
undefined says our team is considering arbitrum network for building social-related protocol – who should i contact about that?
undefined says Yup, and when sequencer post the data to l1, it will also push delayed inbox’s messages into sequencer inbox.
undefined says I don’t think we have public grant for this now, but you can contact our bd team by partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says I bought Odyssey NFT 2 week ago but why is Arbinaut role still not accumulating ok?
undefined says Currently, is only the Sequencer responsible for the block_process on Arbitrum?
undefined says And is there a way to find out how much was paid for L1 and how much for L2 from that sum total?
undefined says Scammer!!!

undefined says How do they fail do you have any error logs
undefined says `HttpProviderError`. The network seems unstable.
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs could you please have a look ^
undefined says Are all transactions on Arbitrum limited to 117kb? I see this line from the docs, which talks about inbox messages, but can't seem to find anything discussion pure l2 txs. <https://developer.arbitrum.io/proving/osp-assumptions#inbox-messages-must-not-be-too-large>

> The current length limit is 117,964 bytes, which is 90% of the max transaction size Geth will accept, leaving 13,108 bytes for other proving data.

Some questions about this:
* Am I seeing correctly that the largest tx is 117kb on Arbitrum?
* With any future upgrades, are there plans to change this number?

Thanks!
undefined says contracts for a free-mint token im launching on ETH are live on BSC and Polygon testnet. working out bugs and will be adding to ETH and eventually ABRI testnet soon. DM if you want to help test, we are rewarding testers after our mint 😁
undefined says It looks like there is not a practical `gasLimit` cap for an Arbitrum transaction. Per the docs <https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/#l2pricingstate>:

> ArbOS's per-block gas limit is distinct from geth's block limit, which ArbOS sets sufficiently high so as to never run out. 

Does that sound correct? Will a tx I send ever be limited by the gasLimit? This tx  `0x94ef9efcc35210093ae4f8ee59f4b4772bc5a04ba92e870fd3593dadabf0c5d6` on goerli arbitrum used 492,116,711 gas, which seems to point to this being true, but would love some clarifiaction.
undefined says Anyone familiar with how to use the IPC RPC w/ my nitro node?  I don't know the path to it (running inside docker)
undefined says I think that you are ultimately limited by the max gas in a block.

The nodes have configurable limits, and default to the following:
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I did some searching in this channel and online and am a little confused on how to set up an IPC RPC instead of using HTTP/WS.  Usually geth would print a path to the IPC file on node startup, could you point me to how to do this with a Nitro node?  I see that IPC support was added.
undefined says Did you ever figure this out @iamaloop ?
undefined says no i've just been using https to localhost
undefined says I see - thanks for the share. I wonder what nodes are actually using, as I do not necessarily believe that the default is being applied. Two things that I am seeing that prove this wrong are (1) the tx I liked on Goerli Abrbitrum used 500m gas, (2) arbiscan shows a cap of 1,125,899,906,842,624.

So I guess I'm curious what the implement cap it on mainnet arbitrum
undefined says Gotcha, I know IPC support is added, I saw the changeset, I will let you know when I figure it out if you'd like
undefined says ty for quick reply, man!
undefined says I believe what you're seeing on arbiscan would be the block limit?  Only cause it's showing on a row w/ a block and not w/ a tx.  Not 100%
undefined says I would guess that most node operators are running with the default settings for those values but I am not positive
undefined says I see -- yes that is a good point. But wouldn't a tx gasLimit only be bound by the block itself? For example, on mainnet, a tx can be up to 30m gasLimit because that is the block limit.
undefined says More than 10 trades on Zigzag exchange, no bugs no problems, thanks. Wallet : 0x6a79c1749229179B4f16e6957597fd8f4D2fAe7D
undefined says In arbitrum, gas limit for single tx is 32m
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1212
undefined says It looks like this tx on Arbitrum Goerli used 492116711 gas. Do you know how that is possible?

0x94ef9efcc35210093ae4f8ee59f4b4772bc5a04ba92e870fd3593dadabf0c5d6

```
undefined says 
undefined says It looks like that value is `488772968`
undefined says `"gasUsed":"0x1d551ae7","gasUsedForL1":"0x1d221568"`
undefined says And here is a post-nitro tx on mainnet arbitrum with 150,299,733 `gas_used_for_l1`

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x7ecde1200b8d8b3fcb537f15138d61f5f381225f8a55def25ecf58087efc0a11
undefined says 32m is for gasUsdFoL2 part, which is normal evm opcode compute cost.
undefined says You can get it in transaction receipt’s `gasUsedForL1`
undefined says I see. That makes sense. Thank you.
undefined says And out of curiosity, are you able to share any info about this question?

undefined says Indeed, I have a similar pb
I am using ethClient to interact with some evm blockchains.
After the migration to nitro, we have issues with some functions such as BlockByNumer where we get "transaction type not supported" during the parsing of the result.
Therefore I have few questions:
Q1. Is it always possible to use ethClient to interact with the arbitrum BC?
Q2.   how to check the provided ethereum rpc api (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient) is working or will be working with the different upgrades?
Thanks

undefined says Is an error transaction on L2 packaged into batches and submitted to L1 as data? I think it should not be. A well-behaved Sequencer will filter out invalid transactions. Even if the error transaction is submitted to the sequence unexpectedly Sequencer occurs, the state transition function will detect and discard it.
undefined says May I ask when can the node verification be decentralized?
undefined says I noticed on Twitter that decentralization will be done soon! Can the decentralization of nodes be completed this year?
undefined says Invalid tx won’t be batched, but reverted tx will because it changes sender’s nonce.
undefined says No timeline on this now.
undefined says How are the Arbitrum Chain blocks produced? Who is responsible for producing the blocks?

Could somebody help me?
I ran arbitrum one mainnet and goeli node.
It is possible to connect to the node via HTTP, but it is not possible to connect via WS, although port 8548 is open to the world.
Perhaps I need to write docker startup flags?
My docker run line looks like:
```
docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.8-5b9fe9c --l1.url https://x.x.x.x:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*
```
undefined says check
undefined says What endpoint do you use for wss
undefined says check
undefined says endpoint to connect to my node is ws://my_node_ip_address:8548/
undefined says /check
undefined says could you try: wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/ws
undefined says can you share your network settings please
undefined says are you following any documentation could you share please

undefined says " The state transition function is deterministic, which means that its behavior depends only on the current state and the contents of the next transaction--and nothing else. Because of this determinism, the result of a transaction T will depend only on the genesis state of the chain, the transactions before T in the sequence, and T itself. " from arbitrum docs. 

If state transition function always gives correct results after execution transactions and filter invalid transactions, then how come invalid state root can be sent to Ethereum???

On arbiscan,  can't find anywhere the link to the state root which is sent to rollup smart contract on ethereumfrom time to time??
undefined says Hey,
The validator is supposed to send new rollup blocks that satisfy the rule we mentioned. But a malicious validator may send wrong state root. So there should be a way to challenge wrong claims.
undefined says The state roots are sent back on L1 (Ethereum mainnet). So you can find them on the Rollup smart contract on Ethereum (on Etherscan not arbiscan)
undefined says the real Shane Fontaine of Stack Overflow
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/randy-savage-crown-nods-wwe-yeah-gif-16707535
undefined says For example, if batch no. 31885 containing 1146 transactions was sent to L1, does the state root(sent to L1) we get after executing these 1146 transactions of layer 2  or the state root, composed of transactions from multiple batches is, sent to Layer 1??
undefined says By rollup block (RBlock), you mean state root, right??
undefined says Part of the RBlock is the state root. There’s other things on RBlock as well.
undefined says Like number of txs in the Rblock etc
undefined says so state root(result of prev. state root and no. of transactions mentioned in current Rblock) present in current Rblock ???
undefined says basically first option is correct, state root sent inside Rblock, that particular Rblock also contain current no. of transactions responsible for current state root)
undefined says Each RBlock contains:

1. the RBlock number
2. the predecessor RBlock number: RBlock number of the last RBlock before this one that is (claimed to be) correct
3. the number of L2 blocks that have been created in the chain's history
4. the number of inbox messages have been consumed in the chain’s history
5. a hash of the outputs produced over the chain’s history.

undefined says Anybody know why ethers' `contract.on` event listeners don't fire when I'm using Arbitrum? Works fine locally and on Goerli.
undefined says Maybe a metamask signer issue, seems to work with an infura provider
undefined says I need just some flags in docker run line to enable connect via ws and set the port. Do you know these flags?
undefined says somethings like --ws-enable --ws.port=8548
```
docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.8-5b9fe9c --l1.url=http://3.15.110.132:8545 --l2.chain-id=421613 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*

```

full line looks like:
```
docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.8-5b9fe9c --l1.url=http://3.15.110.132:8545 --l2.chain-id=421613 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.api=eth,net,web3,txpool,debug --ws.origins='*' --ws.addr=0.0.0.0

undefined says Are all Arbitrum ERC20 contracts that get created from the L2ERC20Gateway fated to be unverified?
undefined says Here is the code: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/L2GatewayToken.sol
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs right, I mean verified on a block explorer like Etherscan. We can keep the thread going in the #💎︱solidity channel
undefined says If there is transaction that is just sending eth from one to another on layer2, will it be included in sequencer and batched to layer 1?
undefined says As far as I understood, every transactions happend on layer2 is included in sequencer and batched to delayed inbox on layer 1 and logged on layer 1.
Then does it mean if someone make account on layer2 and do something, it will be applied on layer 1 as same as layer 2?
undefined says All transaction on l2 will recorded to l1, but different bridge has different process, if it is liquidity bridge, it will act as normal transaction, but if it based on l1, you should withdraw eth to l1 and re-send to another l2.
undefined says Sequencer batch will go to sequencer inbox rather than delayed inbox, but the recording is as calldata rather than state data, so you can not query it on l1’s contract. And this will also not affect your l1 state, because they don’t share the same state.
undefined says I get a lot of INFO messages stating: "Unindexed transactions"
undefined says not sure when it first started happening but is this right?
undefined says Thanks for answer. I think I need to read more docs haha 😂
undefined says You can see this if you are interested: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
undefined says I thought this is normal
undefined says okay, interesting! Doesn't it mean my node is missing some transactions?
undefined says It doesn’t miss.
undefined says right
undefined says Hello! I was taking a look at the transaction history of an address I came across, and I'm confused with how bridge transfers of ETH between L1 and L2 are represented.

* L1 deposit: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfb7a3ef269c851025dfa2d83408eb2e1bfd27eb2630f46926a1ee924f965eb8b
* L2 transaction: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xb5821fd7b9da1ded13566109b3e2c1f44df245f5992bb42bbae310e85d3f80f7

The L1 part makes sense to me, but the L2 part does not. Indeed the transaction seems to be withdrawal. The deposit ETH amount goes *from* `0xdae2ad9b0df4397bbafcdd3eabb15fca627a1be6` *to* the `ArbRetryableTx` address.

I would have expected the funds to go *from* the `ArbRetryableTx` address *to* `0xdae2ad9b0df4397bbafcdd3eabb15fca627a1be6`.

Is there anything I'm missing here? Thanks for your help!

(I shared Arbiscan links, but BlockScoot, via https://explorer.arbitrum.io/, reports the same thing.)
undefined says I notice that the L1 side, the user interacted with an address labelled "Arbitrum: Old Bridge" by Etherscan, if that helps.
undefined says there is an earlier post about it: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1033890973073281065 let us know if you have any questions
undefined says This is how we handle eth deposit transaction on classic Verizon, in nitro version, it will change to your aliased address send to you like this: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x886f095a780c3de725e1d9ce022e3fe8119e4c68ef7c709fb9c9677ea43ee674
undefined says Thanks for your help guys, I'm taking a look now and will revert if needed. 🙂
undefined says What is "Verizon" here? I'm guessing auto-correct issue as I can't find anything online but I prefer to make sure 🙂
undefined says We have upgrade arbitrum one to nitro stack on August 31th, so it will be different from current way and the way in classic version, you can see eth here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md and https://developer.arbitrum.io/why-nitro

undefined says Can someone help me on this: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1043523039104606239/1045173144157171822
undefined says Can I set "to" parameter when doing depositEth from L1 -> L2?
I checked Inbox.depositEth but it seems not to recieve specfic L2 address.
Anyone knows how?
undefined says You can use createRetryableTicket to do this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L378 with call value.
undefined says FTX has been removed from DAC of nova?? if yes, is there another member added??
undefined says Yes! FTX has been removed and we will announce new members in lieu of FTX shortly! Stay tuned! :arbiblobblue:
undefined says Can you tell me how I can speed up the synchronization? I installed the node, it goes very slowly, it seems to me that this is abnormal.
undefined says This probably depends largely on your L1 node connection speed, as well as the CPU speed
undefined says BTW we now have a #🏃︱noderunning  channel where you could ask your node-related Qs.
undefined says i did this role but still have this problem way
undefined says guild has some issues and the team is fixing it, check #✅︱roles
undefined says Where is the code for cross-chain communication,for example: The Sequence gets the L1 delay-inbox message. I can't seem to find these code. @roo | Won't DM u 1st
undefined says Hey :arbiplanet: :arbitrum:
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/inbox_reader.go
undefined says emmm... where are the files?
undefined says No consensus? How to produce L2-block? Only the Sequencer？
undefined says an error in the swap does not change the number even on reboot and gives 1:1 to the ethereum
undefined says ??????
undefined says hey bro, check this msg https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/993956960707825777/1044624324893622343
guild currently having some issues and the team fixing it, you role will back when fixed
undefined says well understood thanks)
undefined says Hey
undefined says problem with Guild API
undefined says when they fix it they don't say?)
undefined says Keep an eye out for #✅︱roles  , the team will say when it's fixed.
undefined says I feel like when it's fixed, you get it automatically.
undefined says :arbichief:
undefined says waiting of course))
undefined says lol]
undefined says what
undefined says I want to run my own node. But I don't see the command to connect my wallet. Please help me, tks sir
undefined says what are the new activities here?
undefined says Guild, layer3
undefined says any devs that can help me?
undefined says I am launching a token on Arbitrum super excited. What is the average block time reported?  I can get daily averages at https://arbiscan.io/chart/blocktime

Would you say 0.3s blocktime is average
I can change the value anytime its just for a frontend
undefined says is there an API anywhere that serves that value?
undefined says Please wait patiently for help from dev members
undefined says Bro I’ve waited all day I’ve been very patient
undefined says what is the issue could you share details
undefined says Can someone explain to me the following occurrence. There exist two Arbitrum Classic transactions, one of which has the effectiveGasPrice field in the receipt while the other does not. AFAIK, both should contain the field. Examples:
1.  0xa188d52ff8f99c981b00a60585d2a32ef3f46a6bc03b2716948f69d2161c94af -> field missing
2. 0xe8648e3ad982a3d67ef0880d6631343cffff364786994b34e5fa292cfef0e680 -> field present
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says note
undefined says They do have the field:
undefined says Hello! I'm going through your docs rn and got a question:
We know that Arbitrum is an optimistic rollup. Thus, there is a 7 day window to challenge a state/block. However, the docs says that Sequencer publishes batches to L1 every few minutes which guarantee its finality (hard finality). So since the batches get finality, how validators can challenge them? 
What will happen to the network if, f.e., after 6 days one of the block finds to be false? How to revert the state of the chain since there were thousands of transactions, etc during the 6 days?
undefined says @roo | Won't DM u 1st I’ve been trying to figure out the guild an I’m being told 15 different things I’d like a devs so I can one on one
undefined says Hey! The sequencer finality is a soft finality. The hard finality is when the RBlcok (the state of the ArbOS) is posted on L1 by a validator and confirmed-- which only happens after the dispute window is past. You can see these steps here:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/tx-lifecycle
undefined says Hmm, what "every few minutes" means then? I probably got confused
undefined says Oh, I see. He posts these batches every few minutes, but they receive their finality only after the 7-day period, right?
undefined says That's right!
undefined says Thanks for clarification! Preparing a deep dive article on Arbitrum btw :pepe1:
undefined says Ofc! Good luck! :arbifrog:
undefined says hey guys
undefined says RCPswap
undefined says Thank you for your prompt response. I am using Alchemy as a provider, and on the response I get, there is indeed no effectiveGasPrice field present.
undefined says we have any dapps to use
undefined says on arbitrium nova ?
undefined says Are you looking for SDKs
undefined says Hey Mahsa, would you mind if I dm you regarding my article? It would be so nice if I can get some help from your side.
undefined says Or anybody else from the team :pepeheart:
undefined says Hey all arbitrum users
undefined says Hey! Yup you could send me a DM
undefined says Done :arbiflame:
undefined says G
undefined says https://goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0xa82ec0339c076bfc99769ecaf5334c4fcf86dec3c16b354f44bd8bed8ac4dc51
Why this transaction failed
undefined says ok
undefined says What's the recommended way to run by manual building from the source code?
undefined says :arbitrum:
undefined says These are the potential reasons:
https://info.etherscan.com/what-happens-when-erc-20-token-transfer-might-have-failed/
undefined says done
undefined says Done
undefined says Could someone tell me how can I create a custom token on arbitrum? Or give me the link for github bc I don’t find it. I have just find “how to bridge a custom token”
undefined says 👀
undefined says I did all the missions, why did I lose the role? help me
undefined says Hey everyone. I am trying to integrate Arbitrum SDK into my protocol. 
I am wondering if there is any specific reason why the SDK still uses the versions 5.1.x of the `ethers`  npm package (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/package.json#L47-L52). 
Do you plan to upgrade this dependency to the latest version at some point?

The issue i am facing: 
I am trying to incorporate your SDK inside a multi SDK system where we use the latest ethers version = 5.7.x. Everything should work logic-wise however i am struggling to get the typescript compiler satisfied since ethers 5.1.x and 5.7.x hold slightly different Provider & Signer type definitions.

Thank you!
undefined says love
undefined says Anyone knows how to stake$ magic?
undefined says как две дургие получить?
undefined says Послідній треба в твітері вставити до ніку цей смайлик
undefined says Hey! Could you please dm me the related repo or some exact errors?
undefined says Creating a custom token on Arbitrum directly (without bridging from L1) would be similar to deploying any other contracts (e.g., https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/demo-dapp-election)
But you have to be aware that this way the token cannot be transferred to L1
undefined says Thank you for your response! Will write you a detailed DM
undefined says Great! Thanks!
undefined says Ola!! I want to use this script: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit to bridge to Nova chain. Is it going to work? As the docs mention only One.
undefined says Hey! Yes it does! You need to set the L2 RPC to `https://nova.arbitrum.io/rpc`
undefined says wonderful. thx for such a prompt answer.
undefined says Happy to help!
undefined says H
undefined says 👍
undefined says Is the following correct around tx ordering?
Sequencer currently orders with 1st come 1st serve basis (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas#tips-in-l2)
And this is just "mode 1" as it moves to modes 2, and 3 here -> https://www.mev.wiki/solutions/mev-minimization/arbitrum-offchain-labs
undefined says Question: Is it possible for a deliberately low-priced tx (even 0 gasprice) to be submitted to Arbitrum, and then another service sees the tx and resubmit it with a sensible amount of gas? 
Or breaking the question up:
- do low- / 0-gasprice txs get rejected by Arbitrum?
- how public is the submission of a tx to Arbitrum (even if rejected) now, and into the future?

Related Q/A -> https://support.arbitrum.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411923413531-Pending-transaction
undefined says Hey! We don't have a mempool, instead we have a queue on our sequencer that keeps track of received transactions. There isn’t space limit on our queue, but txs will be dropped based on a timeout if they couldn’t get through. Our sequencer will pick transactions based on the order in the queue. And 0-gasprice txs won't get into the queue.
Also, dropped txs would not be visible publicly
undefined says What about non-zero under-priced txs?
undefined says it will be dropped unless the price large than or equal to the blackchain base fee.
undefined says Can external people watch the queue?
And how long, if at all, will such a tx exist in the queue (ie observable) before being dropped?
undefined says No! that's private. Although it's basically empty most of the time since txs are sequenced immediately
undefined says Thanks everyone
undefined says check where it is
undefined says hope to learn something here
undefined says like arb
undefined says arb
undefined says Hiho
undefined says How different a process is it building on arbitrum vs eth
undefined says Is it all the same because of EVM compatibility?
undefined says Hey how can I change the directory of my full node on arbitrum to put something else than home user .arbitrum
undefined says I get : ```Fatal configuration error: unable to create global configuration directory: mkdir /home/dante: permission denied``` when i add persistent global config flag
undefined says d
undefined says hm
undefined says Any mod?
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs can you here me?
undefined says good question
undefined says is there a snapshot to speed up sync of a new node ?
undefined says ^ Curious as well
undefined says Hellohello ✨ 
If I'm looking to read a value on a L1 contrat, from a L2 contract, i have to go through the messaging system right?
undefined says I just launched a token on Arbitrum I have been developing for over a year
Where do I advertise 🙂
undefined says There are some differences you need know when building on arbitrum: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/solidity-support
undefined says Did you use docker to run your node? If so, you can change your outside mount point
undefined says We have snapshot for classic (not for the latest nitro node): 
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar , for nitro, we only has seed db that we already post on our node document: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
undefined says You can send tx from l1 to l2 to update this value, rather than send request from l2, because it won’t let you wait 7-8 days’ challenge window.
undefined says You can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, I'm trying to sync an Arbitrum node and I'm having some issues. The process seemed to have stopped unexpectedly, and now it's restarting. I'm getting the error "Resuming state snapshot generation" and "Aborting state snapshot generation". Is this normal, or should I be concerned? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
undefined says What is your start command?
undefined says I ran the `docker run` command in the docs, this time that didn't have the --init.url flag
undefined says If you downloaded genesis database, you don’t need set this flags dod you finish downloading it last time?
undefined says Yes I finished downloading but not sure if I finished extracting/rebuilding to the current state
undefined says When did you restart your node?
undefined says You can just wait as the eta said, if it is still not work, you can dm me your start command.
undefined says Hey guys ! What's the best tutorial with examples for l1-l2 messaging ?
undefined says Found a couple but missing the full loop
undefined says Hey! Here's an example:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter
undefined says Thanks, checked just now and it's still not sync'ing (although last said it said ETA would be 3-4 hours). Sent a FR and will DM once accepted
undefined says Seems the ETA now (self calculated) is going to be close to 43 hours.. Is that normal?
undefined says I don’t know why bridging from arbitrum to Mainnet will take 9days
undefined says thxx
undefined says Can someone confirm that these two transactions on Arbitrum Classic:
1. 0x3eb46199e6cab2db55cfdcb5c4582f8641df6e3bf56ed3a2e0fc0e644e64b7d4
2. 0xe7ff892aa6e23149442930325e04b83e55baeb422b7f97c6cfed605373a964a6

Contain feeStats in the receipt? When using Alchemy as a provider, they do not appear (the field is not present)
undefined says why i can't post message here ? it says: "This can't be posted because it contains content blocked by this community. This may also be viewed by the community owners."
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs  ? 🙂
undefined says Please ask this in #📬︱support
undefined says how can i change rpc http port on the node ? --http.port and --node.rpc.port giving me an error and stop the node
undefined says Is there a consolidated archive node guide?
undefined says This may be because of liquidity on the bridge
undefined says Because there is fraud proof challenge window, which allow others validator to make a challenge to the state, so we should have enough time for validators to check and make challenge.
undefined says FeeStats isn’t supported in nitro node although they are classic’s transaction
undefined says Please avoid saying h i or he llo
undefined says Do you use docker to run your node? If so, you can change the mapping port so you can request other port in your host.
undefined says Just to reiterate: every Classic transaction is expected to have the feesStats field, given that the node that generated the response is a Classic node? Therefore, this occurrence is explicitly and only related to the provider (where the provider seems to be responding with a response generated from a Nitro node), and is no way related to the Arbitrum protocol?
undefined says Correct you need use classic node to get that feeStats field, you can use arbiscan’s advanced information to get that field now.
undefined says But you can also run your own classic node. (Can only sync to 31/08/2022)
undefined says I am testing with Alchemy, and it seems that it partially works (meaning some Classic transactions have the field while others do not). Anyways, thank you for confirming
undefined says Np
undefined says now, can i run node for arbitrum?
undefined says what is staking, it is good?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says run node can get reward in future?
undefined says Nope
undefined says ok
undefined says A sanity check, is the token 0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1 the legit WETH? Inspecting the contract events, the latest wraps/unwraps happened some 500 days ago. For reference, wrap event signature: 0xe1fffcc4923d04b559f4d29a8bfc6cda04eb5b0d3c460751c2402c5c5cc9109c (can be used on Arbiscan UI to filer events by contract)
undefined says do it
undefined says wk
undefined says :nova:
undefined says no , i'm using it directly on my server as a service. so no possibilty to change the port on the node settings itself like --http.port and --node.rpc.port ?
undefined says Hey, WETH addresses are:
`Ethereum: 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2
Arbitrum: 0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1`
undefined says HEY
undefined says nice work
undefined says 🪙
undefined says :Reddit:
undefined says could someone please elaborate why smart contract wallets (Gnosis Safe) aren't allowed to use the bridge?
undefined says this cuts out institutional teams
undefined says When you set http.port, what errors do you get?
undefined says Because if sender is contract, it will aliases the fest address: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L346 , this is to avoid if funds goes to l2’s contract, but l2’s contract doesn’t have fallback or receive function , it will be reverted on l2.
undefined says is this some specific limitation with the Arbitrum bridge only? We're able to use other bridges this way.
undefined says appreciate the input
undefined says also is there a workaround?
undefined says some bridges also have a Dest address option, so that you're not limited to EoAs
undefined says You can try use this way: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L449
undefined says Also, you can use 3rd party bridge to transfer your token to arbitrum
undefined says That would be a workaround.
undefined says hey is it possible to fork nitro goerli chain and produce transactions for the sequencer?
undefined says What is used for the data field when bridging ERC20 tokens with outboundTransfer() on Arbitrum One Bridge?
undefined says You can use hardhat to fork it to your local
undefined says fork arbitrum one and submit l2 transactions on goerli through the sequencer would work then?
undefined says You mean fork mainnet’s arbitrum and submit goerli’s transaction? If so, you should change the forked arbitrum’s chain id, if they are not same, tx won’t be processed, if you just want to see what going on for a tx, you can use tenderly to simulate it.
undefined says We have a tutorial to show how you can process the tx through our bridge: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit
undefined says Thanks for this, the issue with the tutorial is that it's referencing the SDK. I am building a smart contract that interacts with the bridge and want to test the outbound transfer function on Hardhat via my contract, is there a reference somewhere explaining how the data field is composed?
undefined says 
undefined says mhhh, your security spam bot is broken i think 😄
undefined says You can also see how our sdk propose this data, the hard thing is to let your contract know l2’s gas price bid, you may need to feed this data when you call your contract and let it pass to our bridge.
undefined says `invalid argument "" for "--http.port" flag: strconv.ParseInt: parsing "": invalid syntax`
undefined says What is the full command you set to start it?
undefined says my bad, i think i added a "space" and that's why it crashed. `--http= 8549`
edit: my apologies. problem fixed with `--http=8549`
undefined says we can use hardhat to fork the goerli nitro chain but the issue with that is if the hardhat process is killed for any reason, we lose all data on the node. Is there a way to prevent this?
undefined says Hmm, I am not sure either, you might ask hardhat if they have those method to prevent data lost.
undefined says Sir, I was bridge my eth from mainnet to L2, it already takes more than 1 hours and still didnt landed yet, what happen? What I need to do now?
undefined says Is your l1 transaction confirmed or not?
undefined says Ofcourse, anw it just landed now 😅 1 hours 48 minutes
undefined says hey what's the plan for the sources of randomness on arbitrum?
undefined says should i just bridge randao values from mainnet in a arbitrum public good smart contract that maps block numbers to randao values? 

public good for whole abritrum ecosystem
undefined says Helloo, i wanted to ask about MEVs attacks in Arbitrum, i heard that is not possible. can you explain more please?
undefined says How can I mint an NfT on Arbitrum testnet please???
undefined says Can you send me the rpc requests you used to test for classic coverage?
undefined says but this cuts out all Gnosis Safes, doesn't it?
undefined says any consideration there to allow this in the future?
undefined says Arbitrum uses first come first service and don’t have mempool, so we won’t pick up tx but just serve it once it comes.
undefined says You should find if there is a nft project on our testnet which allows you to mint.
undefined says For safety, that will make some potential threats if allow this, you could also use 3rd party bridge to move your funds.
undefined says yea, but unfortunately most third party bridges are liquidity bridges
undefined says and most don't have good liquidity
undefined says so this is probably holding Arbitrum back to some extent
undefined says appreciate the context
undefined says assuming you are trying to prevent against the `tx.origin` malicious fallback() function attack vector
undefined says how do other networks solve this issue?
undefined says I remember others bridge like op they also only allow EOA to call depositEth.
undefined says I do not have the source at hand, but it was a standard eth_getTransactionReceipt call
undefined says Can someone explain to me how come transaction 0xfd95a175353ea397a9240d034eba6aded2a6cd466e5353cd1efef8af43feafb2 has 0 fee
undefined says I have nft but it says no, how can we fix this problem, please help.
undefined says I have completed all the conditions for the Guild, when will I be given my roles?
undefined says 
undefined says abitrum full node mainnet. Is this ok?
undefined says @habibihamut667 @Pharmacy This channel is a protocol channel. Please ask questions in #💬︱general or #📬︱support
undefined says Is there anyway to get arbitrum side deposit hash for an ethereum deposit hash? If so can someone post the example? I noticed the sdk has a `getEthDeposits` method but I rather not pass in my provider / ethers js wallet. Does anyone know any other ways to do this?
undefined says For any interested devs: Randomizer is looking for 2 more Arbitrum project devs to run a VRF beacon (generates ETH yield)

https://twitter.com/RandomizerAi/status/1596879409339842562
undefined says Out of the big ones, Polygon Bridge allows it
undefined says as well as liquidity bridges such as Hop and Multichain
undefined says 
undefined says is there an api that can help me pull out all NFT’s belonging to a wallet address for Arbitrum please?🙏🏻
@Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is it possible to get the initiating eth deposit txh hash from the final complete arbitrum deposit tx hash?
undefined says This tx is a `finalizeInboundTransfer` that happened before our Nitro upgrade. Looking at the explorer, you could see all the `finalizeInboundTransfer`s used to have zero TxnFee(ETH)  before Nitro upgrade. That's because the retryable gas used to be charged during  `redeem` ing of the ticket, whereas it is now collected at the time of the submission
undefined says would you give a link to the guide for installing the node?
undefined says lol
undefined says how do I mount the docker so that it persists?
undefined says You can use arbiscan’s api (https://docs.arbiscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts#get-a-list-of-erc721-token-transfer-events-by-address) as a helper to calculate it.
undefined says I don’t think it is possible to do this directly , but you can use the receiver’s address of the final deposit hash to check it l1’s transaction, and find the tx which match this deposit hash, to find if it matches, you can see here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L628
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says You mean mount the docker’ dir to host’s dir? Add -v
undefined says I got it ok, in this method, would the receiver address be the address receiving the deposited funds on the l2 side? If so who would be the form address?
undefined says Also, how is the time for an arbitrum withdrawal to go through determined? Noticed on goerlie test net it takes ~4 hours, how long does it typically take  on mainnet?
undefined says The from address is aliased address: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
undefined says You main bridge your ETH from mainnet to arbitrum right? It usually only takes a few minutes on mainnet.
undefined says What is the native token on Arbitrum?
undefined says It’s l2 Eth - Aeth
undefined says Awesome ty
undefined says Why does it show that I need to pay  for $40 when deploy contract? anyone help me?
undefined says Where do you see it, are you on testnet it depends on the smart contract its complexity
undefined says i'm in arb mainnet
undefined says Thanks please share more details
undefined says just like this

undefined says Could you share the repro steps
undefined says https://gist.github.com/ykjonney/4d324130ae1a3f59ab07a20bd2b40148
undefined says What is your maximum gas price set?
undefined says You can click `edit` to see the gas fee details.
undefined says i use the default value
undefined says The gas price on arbitrum now is 0.1gwei, but here is 2.7gwei, this is the reason why it costs so much.
undefined says it works, set gas price 0.1, thanks
undefined says Np
undefined says I think the $9 is just the quotation on your metamask right? the real fee cost is on arbiscan, and the extra part will be returned to you once your txn submit
undefined says No matter how much the gas price is set (2.7 or 0.1), the actual fee costs are the same, only the quotation on the metamask will shows different
undefined says Correct, gas price are determined by network on arbitrum, what you set won’t be the final price.
undefined says @0xRecruiter | Offchain Labs I received a recruiting email from Belmin Kalkan of offchainlabs.com. Is this from the official offchainlab?
undefined says Hey! Could you please DM me your email address?
undefined says sure
undefined says Right yeah I was talking about the other way around
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says Is there any similar `getExecuteRequest` we can use here(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/outbox-execute/scripts/exec.js#L65), similar to how there is a `getWithdrawalRequest` and `getDepositRequest`? My goal is to just craft the tx body rather than send it with the sdk.
undefined says You could try calling the `executeTransaction()` directly from the Outbox rather than relying on our SDK.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/b20fa84a0b3024668b9c2bc65871a7b142443c63/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L123
undefined says Got it, and the SDK doesn't provide any way of getting the outbox address right? We have to keep track of the outbox address ourself?
undefined says If you're working on an Arbitrum project and you'd like to play a role in the ecosystem's VRF that was built from the ground up, and also generate native ETH yield while at it, ping me! We have 2 slots left for VRF beacons 🙌
undefined says Nah you can get that easily using the SDK. Here's the example I could find that shows how to get the inbox address, you could simply replace it w outbox:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/01cb1dc83f7f652881664d7ae194c1bcb0ba00f0/integration_test/eth.test.ts#L83
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says ```
   const l2Receipt = new L2TransactionReceipt(l2TxReceipt);
   const messages = await l2Receipt.getL2ToL1Messages(ethersProvider);
   const status = await l2ToL1Msg.status(ethersProvider);
```

3rd line is throwing `    call revert exception [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-CALL_EXCEPTION ] (method="latestConfirmed()", data="0x", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.7.0)`, any idea as to why?
undefined says https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x45e5cAea8768F42B385A366D3551Ad1e0cbFAb17#readProxyContract

undefined says when？
undefined says I want to stake
undefined says For this method are the `fromAddress` and `toAddress` the same? Since we are deposited to arbitrum to the same address we are depositing from on ethereum
undefined says https://goerli.arbiscan.io/address/0xf78c203498f5cdd82bf568272395a854f4f107db#deposittxs

Noticed etherscan displays the l1 deposit tx hash, do you think they do it the same wasy as you described
undefined says Nope, it also aliased, for more easier to get this, you can first get this tx receipt instance: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/01cb1dc83f7f652881664d7ae194c1bcb0ba00f0/src/lib/message/L1Transaction.ts#L80, then call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/01cb1dc83f7f652881664d7ae194c1bcb0ba00f0/src/lib/message/L1Transaction.ts#L169, so you can get https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L625 directly.
undefined says Perhaps, but I am not sure.
undefined says Anyone can help me about the node?
undefined says You can directly tell about the issues you encountered here, team will reply when they see
undefined says What is this error? How I can fix it sir?
undefined says It’s normal, not errors.
undefined says I see it no longer works on my alchemy
undefined says Sorry, I don’t get what you mean, so your node connect to l1 using alchemy rpc?
undefined says Yepp, my alchemy now. It's not working anymore
undefined says Can you make an rpc call to your node and see what is the latest block?
undefined says I see it no longer works on my alchemy
undefined says hey guys where can i find the goerli contract addresses for weth? i'm also looking for aUSDC too
undefined says I can't seem to search the block explorer like i can on other explorers, i'm using this https://testnet.arbiscan.io/
undefined says You can find the token list here: https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/FullList/all_tokens.json
undefined says Is it on the metamask sir?
undefined says Perhaps MM doesn’t have that function on the wallet UI, you can send via command: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_blocknumber
undefined says is there a list with token symbols? eg WETH USDC
undefined says You can use this repo to generate: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-lists
undefined says Got it thanks
undefined says Hey all. I'm attempting to retrieve a trace transaction from a txn hash from a year ago, using my local Arbitrum Classic mainnet node since the txn occured pre-Nitro. It's hanging at the below txn and was wondering if anyone else had any idea why?

I'm running the latest Docker image for Arbitrum Classic, fully synced & able to call other transactions:
offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4

`curl 127.0.0.1:8545 --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"trace_transaction", "params": ["0x40fb660ca99b467cedd6345aa4cf3ce7d876fcbfde2fbeb174608e180543401b"],"id":1}' -H 'content-type:application/json'`

I'm not sure I can post links here, but this appears as a contract creation on Arbiscan.
undefined says If I run an Arbitrum Nitro node in watchtower mode, can I get access to the pre-Nitro blockchain data?
undefined says This tx happened post nitro though:
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x40fb660ca99b467cedd6345aa4cf3ce7d876fcbfde2fbeb174608e180543401b
undefined says That's in the year 2021
undefined says OH MY BAD
undefined says hehe, no sweat!
undefined says Looking into it 🙂
undefined says @Yannick M | LedgerQL.com I'd suggest to gracefully shut down the node, start it again, and make sure the DB is not corrupt. 
(+ let us know if the the problem persists)
undefined says thanks, yeah that's what I did prior to posting
undefined says Also question: which number was the 1st Nitro mainnet block?
undefined says This is the very first nitro block:
https://arbiscan.io/block/22207817
undefined says Thanks
undefined says I'm trying to craft some bridging txs. I have a test that succeeded for bridging USDC (hash: `0x4fa3379a2874c680e6f63cecf17edc0c786a4c0c091c39897f008aeab615afda`), which uses the `outboundTransfer()` method. When I try to recreate the tx by submitting a new signed hash with similar args, my tx reverts (hash: `0xc9bc040bed0d4d706909ef8ec08da1af3356504799cfe6ec66ddbc0141ef96c4`)
undefined says should I be using `outboundTransferCustomRefund()` instead?
undefined says Oh wait, this is for getting the L2 deposit hash from the L1 deposit hash, I am trying to do the opposite. When you say it's aliased, could you expand on what you mean ? Do you mean one of the `fromAddress` and `toAddress` is suppose to be the contract address?
undefined says I see that the bridge still uses `outboundTransfer()`
undefined says Could you provide the explorer links for these txs?
undefined says the successful tx: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4fa3379a2874c680e6f63cecf17edc0c786a4c0c091c39897f008aeab615afda
undefined says the reverted one: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc9bc040bed0d4d706909ef8ec08da1af3356504799cfe6ec66ddbc0141ef96c4
undefined says 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
undefined says so i'm actually missing the `data` piece. how is that calculated?
undefined says context: since smart contract wallets (gnosis safe) aren't supported, i'm crafting the payloads so that we can use our MPC multisig (EoA)
undefined says How would we get the l2 erc20 deposit hash from an l1 erc20 deposit hash? Notice there isn't an equivalent `getErc20TokenDeposits` similar to the `getEthDeposits` method
undefined says Looks like you don't provide any value when sending this tx and that's why it failed. As you could see here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/cb71d640d233b0362591f62fac9bf951b733eecd/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L229
The `outboundTransfer` is payable, you need to send some ETH along w it to cover the L2 side of the tx's execution.
undefined says thanks much. and what is expected for the `data` param. e.g:
undefined says can I pre-compute this somehow?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/cb71d640d233b0362591f62fac9bf951b733eecd/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L255
undefined says data here is`(maxSubmissionCost,“”)`
undefined says Are there any public audit reports for the contracts?
undefined says Not for public (as of now)
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs I've posted and got a message "This can't be posted because it contains content blocked by this community. This may also be viewed by the community owners." Would you please approve my message?
undefined says please post this in the #📬︱support channel
undefined says is there a way to verify if your node is synced to the chain and running properly? seems to be ok when I run the "docker logs -f ob123" command but just curious
undefined says is there a sane number that I can safely pass here? Looking at my previous txs, I had the following:
`15256113956204` and `14491344694156`. Also is this in wei?
undefined says Is there an equivalent of this (https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/tokens.uniswap.org) for goerli testnet?
undefined says You can call eth_blockNumber to see if your latest block is same to what arbiscan shows.
undefined says You can call this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L332, it’s in Wei.
undefined says That repo can also used to generate goerli’s token list.
undefined says Anyone here ever use the crossChain library on Openzeppelin?
undefined says it would be really nice if you guys could update the snapshot
undefined says my node died unexpectedly... should have had backups ofc, but the db got corrupted
undefined says gonna take a few days to sync
undefined says I see that the arb one node adds 50G hard drives every week. Is there a command to trim data or this method?
undefined says You can reboot the node. Also we will support offline prune in the near future version: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1360
undefined says You mean, the program will automatically execute the prune process when it restarts?
undefined says this is amazing
undefined says Are failed arbitrum transactions included in mainnet in batches, because i understand that failed tx use up gas for calculations and it needs to be paid, but it's weird to have failed tx price in l1 calldata cost ( i mean why are they rolled up on mainnet at all when they dont change state )
undefined says Good day everyone, who do I talk to about cross chain bridge integration?
undefined says And potentially how arbitrum will use EIP-4844, so bridges can treat it's blob commitments as a finality proof
undefined says Keep getting "Error: cannot estimate gas;" when i was trying to deploy the contract on arbitrum goerli, have no idea what's wrong, anyone can help ?
undefined says They are. Transactions are posted to our Inbox and have their calldata stored, they then get executed and might fail. So just like Ethereum, here users need to pay for their failed txs as well.
undefined says You could send an email to our partnerships: `partnerships@offchainlabs.com`
undefined says This usually happens when you dont have enough ETH on your L1/L2 wallets to pay for the execution. Try to get some ETH in your wallets and that'll be most probably resolved
undefined says thanks !
undefined says thanks!
undefined says I have a question about bridging and `createRetryableTicket`: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/sol_contract_docs/md_docs/arb-bridge-eth/bridge/Inbox.md#createretryableticketaddress-destaddr-uint256-l2callvalue-uint256-maxsubmissioncost-address-excessfeerefundaddress-address-callvaluerefundaddress-uint256-maxgas-uint256-gaspricebid-bytes-data--uint256-external

From what I understand, `l2CallValue` is the amount of ETH that would be bridged from Ethereum to Arbitrum.
So it's not used to pay for bridging right? The amount used to pay is `msg.value` ?

I'm using this kind of implementation: 
```
    uint256 _ticketID = inbox.createRetryableTicket{ value: msg.value }(
      address(executor),
      0,
      _maxSubmissionCost,
      msg.sender,
      msg.sender,
      _gasLimit,
      _gasPriceBid,
      _data
    );
```
https://github.com/pooltogether/ERC5164/blob/5647bd84f2a6d1a37f41394874d567e45a97bf48/src/ethereum-arbitrum/EthereumToArbitrumRelayer.sol#L118

Our specification only bridge messages and doesn't support tokens bridging, that's why we set `l2CallValue` to `0`.
undefined says thankss
undefined says is it possible to know, via on chain state, the timestamp or block number that an l2 tx could be exited on l1?
undefined says or is there a way to consistently know when a tx will be exitable (i.e. will a tx be exitable on l1 after exactly 7 days and 6 hours after the l2 tx)
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs sir do you have a more up-to-date snapshot plz?
undefined says i just spent three days syncing, then decided to backup the node before doing anything else. i stopped the docker container using the recommended command `docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq)`, but somehow my head state is corrupted
undefined says i wish i knew what had happened - unfortunately i wasn't saving logs from the container
undefined says repairing the head state now, we'll see if it works.. last thing i want is to spend another 3 days syncing 😢
undefined says ready to buidl otherwise
undefined says How does the Arbitrum protocol differ from Optimism?
undefined says `msg.value` in this tx will need to cover these things: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L414
undefined says It depends on when validator calls to finalize a rblock, I don’t think this can predict precise.
undefined says Ah ok thanks. So let's say I don't want to transfer ETH from L1 to L2, I should set `l2CallValue` to `0` right?
I don't precisely understand what `l2CallValue` is used for.
undefined says We are planning to optimize the sync thing, btw, if you have chance, you can screenshot what the errors you meet then we can figure out what happened there.
undefined says It is your l2 tx’s `msg.value`, if you don’t need it in your following l2 tx, you don’t need to set that.
undefined says ok - i was running docker with `-rm` so i have no idea why it messed up the head state, even with the graceful shutdown command. sorry 😦
undefined says Ok great, thanks for the clarification!
undefined says ty. on another note, is it possible to get l2 gas values on l1 -- something like the ArbGasInfo precompile except the data lives on l1? basically is it possible to get `maxGas` and `gasPriceBid` values directly from state on l1 so that tickets get autoredeemed?
undefined says We don’t have that function on l1
undefined says It’s ok, it’s better to have logs next time, btw, when you restart your node, does it resync from genesis or it just stuck there?
undefined says yup, i'm saving them now
undefined says 
undefined says dude
undefined says it's a code block
undefined says 
undefined says gonna let this run for a while
undefined says maybe fixable, idk
undefined says and then i'm also syncing another machine too, from scratch (again)
undefined says it's not possible just to update that `.tar` file, huh?
undefined says btw, thanks for your replies.
undefined says also, you could consider updating https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#putting-it-all-together to mention logging to a logfile, if you want users to do that in the future 🙂
undefined says Oh, what is your node’s version?
undefined says Latest
undefined says Just confirmed with latest docker image in GitHub releases
undefined says Might be something went wrong when restart your node, you need to wait it or if it takes long time to repair, you’d better resync it.
undefined says This is my plan sir
undefined says As I said, one node repairing and another syncing from scratch
undefined says Pretty brutal tho.

undefined says I have a task of depositing USDT from L1 to Nova. I've used the token-deposit script (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit). This is my code: https://gist.github.com/foxreymann/32c12443e1c049d03511833bce3254f1
undefined says The code has deposited a token but instead of USDT I want (
https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x52484e1ab2e2b22420a25c20fa49e173a26202cd) it has created a new USDT token (https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/token/0xeD9d63a96c27f87B07115b56b2e3572827f21646). This is unexpected. Could you please help me to deposit the correct USDT token.

undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thanks for the update!
undefined says Thank you for your reply. Much appreciated. I'm stuck here. USDT used by LPs on SushiSwap for example is https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x52484e1ab2e2b22420a25c20fa49e173a26202cd, my script has created a new USDT token https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/token/0xeD9d63a96c27f87B07115b56b2e3572827f21646 that is not used anywhere by anyone. I have a task of depositing the 0x52484 USDT to Nova. Hence my script has deposited wrong USDT.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  so with the latest update `--node.caching.archive` is no longer needed to run a validator in Nitro ?
undefined says Usdt has some issues on nova and your address is not wrong
undefined says You mean run a fullnode?
undefined says Validator has whitelist and you can only run watchover mode validator now, if you just run fullnode, it’s no need to add that flag
undefined says I know its whitelisted but just following the developments . The release note says `Validation on non-archive node` so just wanted to make sure if omitting that flags runs a validator with that release (for the whitelisted ones)
undefined says Ah, correct, It won’t need to run with archive mode
undefined says wonderful addition .
One more question for those that want to prune a node we should start it with 
``` --core.checkpoint-prune-on-startup --core.database.compact --core.database.exit-after```
right ?
1. Do we need to start the node manually after it compacts the db ? 
2. DO we have params on how many blocks of states to maintain while pruning ?
undefined says looks like these params aren't availble
undefined says do you know a way to deposit the other USDT?

undefined says how to upgrade arbOs version 9 for my node
undefined says check msg above
undefined says What support can be offered for new ecosystem projects please?
undefined says are there plans to lower Nova's gas floor from 0.1 Gwei to maybe 0.05 Gwei?
would put it on par with alt L1 gas fees i'm thinking
undefined says What should ı write cmd sir ?
undefined says for update ?
undefined says I’m looking for some test USDC on Arb Goerli. Where could I get some?
undefined says Any arbi project building in shadow here? Me, and my community, are creating an event to allow project's owners to talk about their project in a public way.

I'm sorry as the medium and tweets are in french but you can find the information there : https://twitter.com/_GrindAcademy/status/1603827567076823041?s=20&t=tp7b7kA3qp0zd7Tb-KX4iw

We'll soon translate it in English.

Hope I am in the right chan to talk about that. Modo : do not hesitate to delete if not, no problem ❤️
undefined says Just publishing here too, and then i go
undefined says Hey guys ✨ I'm having trouble importing the Arbitrum SDK into an existing hardhat project or a react app..
I'm importing it doing `yarn add https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk.git`, and everything download+compiles fine.. But after everything's done my node arbitrum folder is still pretty empty and running scripts can't find the dependencies..
undefined says 
undefined says What's the best way to integrate the SDK into an existing project?
undefined says Why can’t I verify my contract on Arbiscan at the minute?
undefined says Running a node is  incentivized?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbSys.sol
undefined says The gas field you need to query l2’s node since this is for l2 execution. The submission cost you can get it from: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L361
undefined says `yarn add @Arbitrum/sdk`
undefined says nice to seee you
undefined says what is the geolocation of arbitrum sequencer?
undefined says Hey all, wanted to update Factor is dropping soon on Arbi:

Here's what's coming:

Would love to hear your thoughts, and to explore collaboration if you're building DeFi!
undefined says I am building nitro locally and needed to run ./build-brotli.sh -w.
Initially, I got  The C compiler  "/opt/homebrew/bin/emcc"  is not able to compile a simple test program.
I fixed that by adding 
SET (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_WORKS 1)
SET (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_WORKS 1)
 to \brotli\CMakeLists.txt. Now I am getting
emcc: error: arm64: No such file or directory ("arm64" was expected to be an input file, based on the commandline arguments provided). I am on a mac with M1 chip. Any suggestions? Thanks

Also can anyone please confirm my understanding of WAVM and answer some questions?
1. it is used for proving only
2. it is called only by validators.
3. how is it called? Are they some test files in Nitro repo, that calls the compiled WAVM? I suppose it is only called offchain? 
4. Is WAVM called only during the Execution Challenge, after Block Challenge, correct? 
5. is challenge_manager.go used for both execution or proving? If execution, why and how is it used? If proving only, why is it not written in rs directly, but rather go?
Thanks

undefined says Trying to build cross chain messaging contract
undefined says If so, you can try use npm to install `@arbitrum/nitro-contracts`
undefined says I did use this command
npm install @arbitrum/nitro-contracts
undefined says But it said "patch-package not found"
undefined says Add `--node.caching.archive` , there is no p2p on arbitrum, so no peers is normal.
undefined says Hmm, try 
```
git clone https://github.com/offchainlabs/nitro
cd nitro/contracts
```
undefined says We have those contract in this repo
undefined says How does block sync and sendTransaction work without p2p?
undefined says Just forward to and feed from sequencer.
undefined says Then, how do work RPC services such as infura fetch sequencer information or send a TX request to the sequencer?
undefined says thanks for the answer 😍
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#optional-parameters
, they will also connect to feed url and forward url which you can see above, so they don’t need to connect to others fullnode peers to sync the state.
undefined says I was missing the "node.rpc.classic-redirect" option. Thank you!!
undefined says Oh, this tag is used to connect to a classic node not connect to feed url.
undefined says First off, the only build that we support is the docker one, which you can build using `make docker`; otherwise if you need a regular node binary, you can run `make build-node-deps`  followed by `make build` and you should be able to build on M1 (also make sure you updated submodules). You don't need to build the WAVM stuff unless you are running a validator, but I am not quite sure you can build that on arm64 right now.
undefined says For the WAVM questions, afaik
1. Yes but you execute stuff with WAVM so you can prove onchain
2. By default yes
3. Validator run transaction over the WAVM implementation offchain to calculate the state
4. Not sure what you mean by called, but validator run everything over WAVM even without a challenge
5. It is used to interact with the onchain challenge manager
undefined says node
undefined says thanks, @gzeon | Offchain Labs , quoting from https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/, `If there is a dispute about the correct result of computing the STF, it is resolved with reference to the WAVM code.`, I guess my question is where in the code, did this resolving happen?
undefined says my understanding with WASM, is it is optimized for portability and security. But if it is built in a docker, isn't it portable already?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/challenge/ChallengeManager.sol
undefined says it probably should build, but maybe some deps need to resolve, not something we have resources to officially support right now
undefined says My question is why WAVM at all? Everything could be written in go and built as a docker, so it is portable. What is the advantage of using wasm? Thanks
undefined says you cannot prove Go/Rust on evm
undefined says WAVM allow us to prove geth onchain
undefined says Isn’t the proving steps done in .sol? I do see some opcode refined in .rs, but I thought those are used offchain because the onchain portion really just need to keep steps as hashes?
undefined says after you use hash to narrow down the disagreement to a single step, the onchain contract written in solidity will need to execute 1 instruction (one step proof)
undefined says that makes sense now. hopefully last question, how does evm call wavm?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/proving/challenge-manager
undefined says I have read that, but it is unclear where/how exactly wavm is called by evm, ie, what is the mechanism that the logic happens
undefined says there is a complete wavm implementation written in solidity
undefined says so .sol does not call WAVM? I am confused. From what @gzeon | Offchain Labs is saying, some opcodes need to be implemented in .rs. WAVM is somehow compiled into evm, so the .sol can execute them. Is it correct?
undefined says There's two WAVM implementations: one written in solidity, and one written in rust
undefined says that was I initially thought. I was able to find corresponding code. So what is the rust implementation for? offchain calculation?
undefined says yeah in order to produce the proofs that the on-chain smart contracts validate, there needs to be an off-chain implementation to execute wavm
undefined says how come  that cannot be  written in .go?
undefined says it could, rust is just faster
undefined says I see the docker entrypoint for both node and validators are the same, so how does the code flow routed into the .rs portion?
undefined says cgo
undefined says i actually still don't understand why rust would be faster than go. Aren't all state transition steps done in go already, as part of execution? Why you cannot just prove those steps? Did you make the prove steps more granular? But still why rust is faster?
undefined says trying to find some information, are there any contracts/examples out there to work with L1 comp/OZ governance that allow for passed proposals to be communicated to L2 and executed trustlessly via the L1 => L2 messaging system?
undefined says This example show how l1 message passed to l2: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter
undefined says any topic for running node member
undefined says How to require hardware for run node ?
undefined says Same as geth
undefined says hai
undefined says Can you share me detail ?
undefined says https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/hardware#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20writing,down%20to%20the%20original%20650GB.
undefined says ho
undefined says Hlo
undefined says Hiall
undefined says I was hoping someone could help me with a dev question. I’m looking for a way to programmatically map L2 blocks to their corresponding batches in L1 using RPCs. Any help would be appreciated.
undefined says Are there any plans to have private payments on Arbitrum? Anyone working on that?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says This could help you:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/ab34773e681d3af182472b82dd1d4423f10fb6cb/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L60
undefined says Thank you, very useful. How do I get to the l1 transaction hash from the l2 block number or this batch number?
undefined says I run a Node 600GB but still not enough for extract nitro. Can you fix it for me?
undefined says We don’t provide this rpc function.
undefined says We will implement manually prune in the future version, I think that might help you.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1360
undefined says If anyone can help point me in the right direction I just realized my full node has not had any requests or transactions in appx 5 days.
undefined says thx for the update
undefined says If you call your node, does it return normally?
undefined says Please，How to use Docker to build a fullnode？
undefined says Do you know how to get gas fees without using ethers.js and arbitrum sdk for L1toL2communication?
undefined says Ok, thank you. But what do you think is the best way to map an l2 block to the l1 tx (from the sequencer to the inbox) where it was appeneded in the rollup?
undefined says Any plans to launch One <-> Nova nft bridge?
undefined says 
undefined says People hey!
Can someone tell me please?
Does the arbitrum support the flag:
```
--txlookuplimit
```
undefined says Not support
undefined says ☹️
Thanks!
undefined says I have an issue with the Uniswap widget. I suspect it is arbitrum server side.
Is there anyone hre that I can get in touch with for support?
undefined says You can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L60 then query `sequencerBatchDeliverd` in this contract and find the tx was emitted in.
undefined says Great, I'll give that a try. And one last question: Is it possible to go the other way around? I mean, can I get the batch range of l2 block from the l1 transaction (batch append)?  Thank you so much
undefined says You can get the messageCount from sequencer’s submission tx, it record the range of sequence transaction batched: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x68ef48d05a30e3697686d138d896629edf6b1783d0d233b0197a683dd584e88d
undefined says Is it correct for me to run like this?
undefined says Can you help me to check the latest block height of RPC node
undefined says tmux ls
undefined says tmux a -t <Login session>
undefined says While starting on the container I am facing this issues
undefined says Tmux
undefined says same error
undefined says Probably an issue with your L1
undefined says I reinstalled node and it doesn't work anymore, can you tell me why?
undefined says please tell me how to delete node
undefined says how to run an L1 chain in a localhost while running on arbitrum node
undefined says Hi! Can you help me to build Arbitrum node ?
I try to setup as this guide: 
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node

But when nitro finished downloading snapshot, i got this issue 
```
ERROR[12-24|16:17:37.141] error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
```
undefined says I used image: v2.0.9-51f9452
Pls let's me know how to fixed it
undefined says Same here.. apparently `/usr/local/bin/nitro` have been changed to `/usr/local/bin/nitro-2.0.8` but I guess that's inside a container so I have no idea how to change that
undefined says is there any guide on how to make arbitrum node ?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says hai
undefined says I saw that the redeem of Retryable ticket may be failed, what should i do before the ticket is expire forever ?
undefined says Do i need to write a special solidity function for it when submission's initial redeem fails?
undefined says now i am running node and want to move my node to other vps can you show me ?
undefined says Is the sequencer feed down?
undefined says See above
undefined says Sequencer feed now can only be called from fullnode software.
undefined says https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/ you can manually redeem it at this website
undefined says You need to move your node’s db directory to your new machine so you won’t take too long to sync it.
undefined says Is this your second time start the node? Does the docker dir mapping same as last time?
undefined says i fixed it last week.
I have to move all data from snapshot directory to main directory. It's working ok now
undefined says Is there an automatic method to  redeem it when initial redeem failed ?
undefined says I am afraid not, but you can write a script to monitor your tx and redeem it when it fails.
undefined says So i need to pay the gas fee for the redeem when initial redeem failed?
undefined says Yes, you need
undefined says Hey, happy to have you in our team, you can apply here: https://jobs.lever.co/offchainlabs
undefined says It's a bit dangerous with this mechanism, i might loss my token forever if the redeem failed.
Is there any solution to reduce risk ?
undefined says Kindly accept friend request @0xdevnet
undefined says who can help me..please
undefined says is only tx calldata from EOA-initiated top-level posted in L1 or are external calls posted the same way? 
Questioning if even worth optimizing calldata between contracts or just EOA to contract? Should be the same? If not, would love an explanation or any resources to dive in.
undefined says Retryable is the solution to prevent this dangerous, if you redeem failed you can retry redeem to get your tx back.
undefined says All tx will post to l1
undefined says What was the reason for this change?
undefined says what kind of vps you used??
undefined says what kind of vps you used??
undefined says wget https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
undefined says require ssd above 800
undefined says which vps pl tell
undefined says ubuntu sir. I've been running for 15 days and for some reason I deleted and reinstalled it and got an error when downloading nitro
undefined says free or charges???
undefined says please dm me
undefined says What is the latest version?
undefined says Is it v2.0.9 ?
undefined says Yup, 2.0.9 is the latest
undefined says Because we found many bots just connect to this url, so now we just let fullnode connect.
undefined says Running a node is incentivised?
undefined says Nope
undefined says And what's minimum requirements of configuration?
undefined says 4core or 6 core
undefined says I also met this question. Can anyone answer it?
undefined says who can help me..please
undefined says what is the block gas limit on arbitrum?
undefined says is one able to see this breakdown of gas used somewhere?
undefined says it's currently 32 million gas
undefined says You could see the breakdown of gas used in our explorer. This is an example I just took from https://explorer.arbitrum.io/:
https://explorer.arbitrum.io/tx/0x67545bb9072ad956201d6447bb8dcf592771b9675ff0dc83de7da27c3f95b9c3
undefined says any link where we can monitor contract deployments on Arbi One, Nova and the testnet?

like this one for Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/contractsVerified
undefined says Hey, this channel is a home for Arbitrum protocol related conversations. You could post these stuffs in #🔨︱ecosystem-builder-announcements
undefined says ArbOne: https://arbiscan.io/contractsVerified
Nova: https://nova.arbiscan.io/contractsVerified
Nitro Goerli Rollup Testnet: https://goerli.arbiscan.io/contractsVerified
undefined says I love you @Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says Apologies if this has already been answered but is the websocket sequencer feed deprecated now? wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
undefined says I don't think it's deprecated
undefined says @cryptotc see here
undefined says Reason is here
undefined says did you solve problem? I have the same problem.
undefined says bridge between L1 and L2 for multisig wallet(or basically any contract that holds certain ERC20 token), how ? suppose I have a multi-sig wallet holding USDC. I want to bridge it from L1 to L2 ? which contract(and function) it should interact with ? and what about the other way round(from L2 back to L1) ?
undefined says another question is that when bridging some arbitrary ERC20 token on L1, I assume a new ERC20 mirror contract would be created by the bridger(if it doesn't exist on L2) which is a minimal  ERC20(logic wise), that is my understand how optimism bridge(rom L1 to L2) worked when I was researching that. Is that the same on arbitrum ? IOW, custom logic of the ERC20 token on L1 would not be available on L2 ?
undefined says I didn't
undefined says If you want to bridge erc20 token, you can just call to our gateway router: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L250 , the to address can be contract address. And here is the address list for our contract: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/useful-addresses
undefined says Is anyone going to address this issue? Everybody who followed official instructions (including me) is getting this error.
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs @hunter | Offchain Labs ?
undefined says @NURUL
undefined says What errors do you get?
undefined says 
undefined says this
undefined says thanks but the 'WARNING' said do not interact with the router contracts and said to use the bridge site(which is only good for end user usage, not the situation like I mentioned). where is the documentation for how to use the bridge/router contract(on both side) properly ?
undefined says i'm getting this too. tried downloading the nitro.tar in advance & some other random tweaks. nothing works
undefined says something is either wrong w/ the instructions or the latest docker image
undefined says also appears to be a typo on the doc:
undefined says So what should we do
undefined says i'm continuing to try random things that won't work until someone is able to fix it or assist
undefined says Hello!

I’ve read that validators must post a stake or collateral of some sort behind each state claim (RBlock). I understood that this is a way to limit Sybil attacks, otherwise a malicious validator (in a permissionless setting) could make a huge number of false claims and delay the protocol forever.

What’s the value of this stake, and what’s the reasoning behind this value?

 Thank you for the attention 🙂
undefined says @0xRecruiter | Offchain Labs@Mahsa | Offchain Labs why i can't claim it ??
undefined says yes withdrawals take 7-8 days through the official bridge, you can switch net to Ethereum and claim your funds when the time is up
undefined says okey thanks
undefined says Hey,  the value is equal to the base stake amount, which is a parameter of the Nitro chain (1 eth)
you could find more details here:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#setting-the-current-minimum-stake-amount
undefined says https://twitter.com/AlphaInsiders/status/1608082932924846081?t=_gddaKehhSXGJoaJjClMFg&s=19
undefined says Why transaction decrease
undefined says ??
undefined says Farmers loose hopes 👀
undefined says Alright, thanks 🙂
undefined says Actually you set the flag but it still says you don’t right?
undefined says You can try use our sdk to do this, we have a tutorial show how to use it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit
undefined says Yes, I did it according to the official document, but I still reported an error, and I don't understand the reason for the error
undefined says Is your node version 2.0.9?
undefined says I use the Docker image：offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.9-51f9452
undefined says This might be a new snapshot reason, we are fixing this
undefined says can you help me, please ?
undefined says i reinstall again, but i problem about erro initializing database
undefined says We are changing the database behind init url
undefined says thank you
undefined says Should be fixed by tomorrow morning
undefined says Thanks for your hard work
undefined says Np
undefined says Please Check Dm my guy
undefined says Now I have to wait for the update to get it running again?
undefined says Yup
undefined says I have a question related to the transaction finality.
If I have well understood, with an optimistic rollup, a block may be rejected during the challenge period (one week). In this case, any applications using assets in arbitrum could be influenced if a block is rejected.
Therefore, how could we take into consideration about this case during the development of the application?
undefined says Github
undefined says we need to redownload the nitro.tar after it's fixed?
undefined says Hey, anyone can read l1’s inbox transaction, and execute on their fullnode, then if they can trust their self, they will get the correct state, no need to read the state that validator make.
undefined says Yeah, their format is different.
undefined says I got this error while I'm trying to get gas estimation.
Do you know how to solve this?
`Error: this._init is not a function`
undefined says Could you send me your gas estimation command?
undefined says Thank you! I've just solved now!
undefined says Is there any way that I can estimate gas limit for L1ToL2Messaging using web3.js?
undefined says I'm currently building with web3.js, but only ethers.js is accepted in ethers.js
undefined says Thanks for the answer.
So , we have to deploy a full node and check the correct state to avoid any problem.
Otherwise, In the arbitrum documentation, it was written that the sequencer may guarantee the results of user transactions immediately. Could you please give me more details about this?
undefined says This is because evm is single-threading which means if we know the tx’s order, the final state must be the same, so if a series of tx has it own order, the state can be determined once the order is confirmed.
undefined says You mean like this: https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth.html#estimategas ?
undefined says I want to do this with web3.js!
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/01cb1dc83f7f652881664d7ae194c1bcb0ba00f0/src/lib/message/L1ToL2MessageGasEstimator.ts#L146-L171
undefined says What this function do is just call this contract’s function: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L25 , web3js has the method to call contract’s function. And the address for that contract is: 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8
undefined says ok. I tried once and it didn't work well, but I will try again.
Thank you!
undefined says Ah, I know why if fails when you tried this before, you should use eth_estimateGas way to call rather than eth_call
undefined says ahhhh, this is why.
undefined says In web3js you should use https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#methods-mymethod-estimategas
undefined says okay. thanks!
undefined says Np
undefined says ww
undefined says we have firewall configuration to allow the node software to connect to the sequencer, we are unable to provide more detail
undefined says you have to use the node software and it will be able to connect
undefined says if you run a node, it will automatically connect to the sequencer, other ways of connection is not supported
undefined says Is this the right way to call getSubmissionCost function in ArbRetryableTx contract?
`const maxSubmissionCost = await arbRetryableTx.methods.getSubmissionPrice(calldata.length).call();`
undefined says my tx was reverted
undefined says This way is only available for our classic version, for nitro version you should call this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L361
undefined says Okayyyy, Ty!
undefined says Do you guys have plans to write nitro version docs in near future?
undefined says Which docs point you to this?
undefined says Well, most of the devs docs I found on Google is about arbitrum one version and little bit hard for me to find nitro version specs!
undefined says Oh, I know, next time you can check the time they write those docs, and you can also visit our official website, we have write this there: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/migration/dapp_migration
undefined says Ty.
undefined says Run node Arbitrum v2.0.9
undefined says can i run node now? How to not encounter any errors, have you fixed the error yet?
undefined says Hallo
undefined says Did this issue solved?
undefined says whats max throughput of arbi? tps wise
undefined says With the current snapshot size 500gb ssd is not enough
undefined says 370gb tar (probably not compressed at all)
undefined says hallo bro, nice project
undefined says The snapshot downloader should stream the tar directly to an uncompressing library and this way avoid having to save the tar to tmp
undefined says is it possible to have an earlier working snapshot?
undefined says ye
undefined says anyone know if new fixed snapshot is out? i'm just blindly trying it. will advise if any luck.
undefined says Very good project
undefined says Are we able to use the 2.0.8 docker image to get this error initializing database situation sorted out or do we have to wait? Been fiddling with it for a day now thinking I was doing something wrong until I joined the discord heh
undefined says Any info how to solve this problem?
undefined says confirmed still busted.
undefined says i dont think so. i was prev using 2.08 but it eventually hits a block where it can go no further
undefined says Dang. Guess we'll just have to wait
undefined says guys i'm new here , i wanted to bring a project to arbitrum , there is someone with the same intentions here?
undefined says is there some Arbitrum devs discord?
undefined says can I please get like 10 Arbitrum goerli testnet ETH here: 0x0965cE48ff8b0d86ED2A01b5e3aBBc11A80cE3f3
undefined says `beforeEVMTransfers` and `afterEVMTransfers` there doesn't seem to be any documentation on what these mean
undefined says but they show up when calling `debug_traceBlockByNumber` on my archive node
undefined says Has the team updated this bug yet?
undefined says What should I do when the team updates and fixes the error?
undefined says New year new fixed snapshot???????
undefined says I am running on 2.0.9 and still facing this bug. .
undefined says K I don't want to overstate things but this is the worst thing that's happened all year
undefined says You can get goreli eth faucet and bridge to arbitrum 

For testnet:
First add the rpc of arbitrum tesnet here on goreli if you have not https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains

Then have some ETH faucet at Goreli Test Network. Check faucet sources provided in https://faucetlink.to/goerli

Bridge ETH faucet, testnet Bridge link provided at #🔗︱links
undefined says I hope this helps?
undefined says ahh
undefined says Surely someone has figured out a workaround for the current issue?
undefined says yup
undefined says oo
undefined says please use our faucet as linked here (Nitro Goerli Rollup): https://developer.arbitrum.io/getting-started-users#get-some-native-currency
undefined says Hey why there is two Contract address of GRT token ?
undefined says hey
undefined says thank you, yes helpful
undefined says useful, thank you señor
undefined says I created an efficient way for you guys to donate Arbitrum Goerly ETH to me
https://goerli.arbiscan.io/address/0x65b17556b468f6b81b85120e62cdff10c027a294

You just use the Donate function from the above contract.
You are all welcome!
The testnet ETH will be put to good use, I will be deploying lots more useless contracts while learning Solidity.

undefined says Hey @Matt | Offchain Labs could you have a look into @Gunslingers issue when setting up their node? They are receiving a certain error message: "error initializing database err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory". Can you help? Thank you all so much.
undefined says I'm getting the same error, quite a few others in here are as well.
undefined says Link me which addresses you are referencing
undefined says Getting the same error as well. This has been an issue for at least a week and should be addressed asap
undefined says @tsahi or someone who is on have a look into this please as others are experiencing the same issue it looks like. When you can. Thank you.
undefined says I'm getting the same error, pls
undefined says It seems quite a few people are getting this error. Please advise us to fix soon
undefined says Is there at least a temporary fix or workaround we can use with an older version @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs?
undefined says Let me check it
undefined says Hey guys how to claim air drop?
undefined says No airdrops, please avoid scams.
undefined says + the same issue with snapshot
undefined says I have some positive feedback! Node has been working really well now for a couple of months! Even with a couple of mega unclean shutdowns when my server borked
undefined says H i, 

Can anybody help me with hardhat ?

I have setup my own dev server and also connected metamask to it, and i can see the test Eth on the arbitrum side...

I have the following config in hardhat, should this work ?

```
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
  networks: {
    arbitrum: {
      url: "http://localhost:8547",
      accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
  defaultNetwork: "arbitrum",
};
```

I get the following

```
ProviderError: HttpProviderError
    at HttpProvider.request (/home/ian/Development/projects/crypto/sandbox/test/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/core/providers/http.ts:78:19)
    at LocalAccountsProvider.request (/home/ian/Development/projects/crypto/sandbox/test/node_modules/hardhat/src/internal/core/providers/accounts.ts:181:36)
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)
    at async EthersProviderWrapper.send (/home/ian/Development/projects/crypto/sandbox/test/node_modules/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers/src/internal/ethers-provider-wrapper.ts:13:20)

```

Weird, i have used hardhat many times for BSC, ethereum and other chains.

I am guessing they might be something different because of it being an L2 ?

Thanks in advance
undefined says It seems its not even calling it which kind of threw me, as I can curl it and I know metamask is working (connected to my local arbitrum chain on port 8547)
undefined says Protocol? Why it’s my primary function
undefined says can you confirm is there an in-network random number generator currently on Arbitrum?  I want to use it for our game. Currently we use Chainlink VFF where its available
undefined says There is currently API3 providing this service with Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG): https://api3.org/QRNG It is run by an Australian University, but please do your own research (https://docs.api3.org/qrng/ & https://medium.com/api3/api3-qrng-web3-quantum-random-numbers-4ca7517fc5bc)
undefined says is this offchain/
undefined says any update?
undefined says What's up with running a node guys? No updates yet or temp fixes?
undefined says 32m gas units right? not `32m * 10 ** 9(gwei)` gas units?
undefined says if you're following the instructions from: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node, L1 Geth devnet gets deployed at `http://localhost:8545`, while L2 Arbitrum Nitro runs at `http://localhost:7545`. 

That being said, I'm not sure if this will fix the particular issue you're having. What code are you running that throws that `ProviderError` from `ethers.js`? Can you wrap the statement in a try/catch like this:

```js
try {
 const contract = await MyContract.deploy();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message);
  throw e;
}
```

and let me know what the error message is?
undefined says yes, gas units; `32M * 10 ** 9` would be the cost of all that gas in ether if the gas price was `1 gwei`
undefined says makes sense yeah just wanted to confirm once that it is not unbounded since 32m gwei units would be pretty infinite
undefined says Hey, arbitrum fullnode doesn’t have p2p mode and it just connect to our sequencer directly (Our sequencer based on US), and you can choose a fast l1 rpc which may help you sync the state. For cloud server, I would recommend you choose a fast NVMe pcie gen4 which will help.
undefined says Sorry we can’t give you more details about our sequencer’s location. As for l1 rpc, for nodes to sync to the latest chain state, they connect to an L1 node to sync the chain’s history that’s been posted in calldata and connect to the Sequencer feed for the transactions that have yet to be posted in batches.
undefined says Excuse me, has this problem been solved?
undefined says I am asking, not sure, sorry for the deny, when it fixed, I will let you know immediately.
undefined says Okay, it's hard for you
undefined says same issue with snapshot
undefined says but working with --init.empty and syncing really fast. could be used as a workaround
undefined says H i Chris, thanks.

I must admit, I am a little confused with all the port numbers 🙂

8547 - was for metamask, so I would presume that this is where the RPC is ? I have connected 8547 to metamask and it does work.

8545 - is the L1 and 7545 is L2, 

but are 8545 (L1) and 7545 being used in my case ? I mean I am sure they are  important 🙂

I thought I should be connecting to 8547 ? I thought this was the important port number to connect to ?

Going to put a catch around it now....
undefined says 
undefined says Same error. with the try catch...
undefined says Ok, I got it working.

i have to do a  --init again and it seemed to work, this is weird, I am going to have a play to see if I can get it to fail again, as all these steps were already performed.

But it is working at the moment 🙂
undefined says workaround:
when snapshot is downloaded and unpacked and you see err="no --init.* ..."
1 go to the nitro folder and move arbitrumdata, l2chaindata, nodes, triecache folders from snapshot folder to nitro
2 start node again without any --init.* specidfied
undefined says 
undefined says Ok fixed, I wrote a long explanation before but the bot removed it because of duplicate text ! 😦

Will keep it short and sweet. After a --detach I was issuing a ```docker compose down```, this caused an issue and subsequent running of the chain.

After running the detech command and you want to bring the docker containers down then i should do a ```docker compose stop``` and not ```docker compose down```
undefined says it depends on what you're testing and building locally. if you are looking to test cross-layer functionality (such as bridging tokens) you may need both. but the L2 port (7545) is running Arbitrum Nitro, so if you want to just test a contract you intend to deploy on L2 and it doesn't necessarily need to talk to L1, you should use that port. Both port numbers should be added to your metamask depending on what layer you're testing.
undefined says thank you for that explanation will be helpful if anyone else runs into it
undefined says Ah Ok thanks Chris, yes - I am not at that stage of bridging yet - but it was on my radar 🙂 So this will come in helpful later. Thanks.
undefined says No worries, maybe we could add a --stop or something to the shell script.. I mean its silly really and probably not needed BUT it stops people like me 🙂 reaching for docker compose and doing a down instead of a stop 🙂
undefined says noted will run it by the team
undefined says Layer2’s node need to connect to l1 , because layer2 is based on l1, you will see the flag needed when you start your node
undefined says Yo does anyone here need oracle/data feeds for whatever API endpoints?
Have an oracle infrastructure thats prod ready, high scale and fully automated
just need like, users/uses now
https://docs.scry.finance/
undefined says Devs can deploy their own oracle with like 100 feeds in under 5m from 0 to prod
undefined says no code needed just a little setup for the nodes
undefined says custom signer sets/thresholds, any APIs u want, any EVM network
undefined says Onchain historical lookup for any timestamp for any feed
undefined says and feed update batching letting u push like 250 feed updates with 1 tx
undefined says Hey, I found this post under search since I was wondering the same & quickly got up to speed. Not sure if you'd figured this out but here's how I have Arbitrum Nitro's IPC working under Docker, on RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8.5. I'm also running both Go-Ethereum & Arbitrum Classic Docker images under the same "eth-mainnet" Docker network.

docker run -d -it --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 --restart unless-stopped --stop-timeout 300 --log-opt max-size=10m --name arbitrum-nitro-mainnet --net eth-mainnet -v /arbitrum/nitro/mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8549:8549 -p 0.0.0.0:8550:8550 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.9-51f9452 --l1.url http://eth-mainnet:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.port=8549 --http.vhosts=* --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.port=8550 --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar" --node.rpc.classic-redirect=http://eth-mainnet:8547 --node.caching.archive --ipc.path="/home/user/.arbitrum/arbitrum.ipc"
undefined says I'm guessing so, because an IPC socket file isn't created by default.
undefined says Compared to Geth & Optimism which create geth.ipc
undefined says Anytime!
undefined says h i @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs , running my own server (dev server) , and I have the private key for the L2 part  - which is outlined here https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node  so I have the test ether on the l2 side - no worries.

On the l1 side, is there a private key somewhere ?

i notice there are 3 addresses created and some have been funded with test ether but on the L1 side - i presume ?

```
./keystore/0x6A568afe0f82d34759347bb36F14A6bB171d2CBe.key
./keystore/0x3f1Eae7D46d88F08fc2F8ed27FCb2AB183EB2d0E.key
./keystore/0xe2148eE53c0755215Df69b2616E552154EdC584f.key
```

Anybody know which are used for what, and the private keys for them ? 

To extract the private keys via geth is not trivial so it would be easier if we knew then.

Or should we not even be touching the l1 ether 🙂 ?
undefined says I notice in config.ts inside the test dev server, this address has been funded 

```
        "0x3f1Eae7D46d88F08fc2F8ed27FCb2AB183EB2d0E": {
          "balance": "1000000000000000000000000000000000"
        },
```
undefined says I was hoping to try and bridge some test Eth from l1 to l2 using the Token Bridge tutorial, although maybe I am not going in the right direction. Of course I already have test Eth on the l2, but I would like to test itl, if its possible
undefined says i'm doing this also - started this morning
undefined says currently on block 28699829 and still counting. Should be synced up in 10-12 hours at this rate
undefined says that all takes so long for each attempt and seems unlikely that i'll get it working... so i just went with --init.empty. Fingers crossed
undefined says it probably was L1 yeah
undefined says you were probably on your way... Its only an issue if that block # stops approaching the actual block of 50million+whatever
undefined says good - no IPC for me but good to know. I gotta use WSS
undefined says maybe. a 24 hour sync up from zero isnt that bad and its pretty close (at current rate i'm seeing)
undefined says i'm too inept with docker to figure it out. i still cant get my node to persist after shut down. it wipes everything lol. i just gotta keep it running forever
undefined says i really should learn more about things and not be a dumbass. maybe in 2024.
undefined says Maybe it's the -v I'm missing. I'll give it a shot thanks!
undefined says 
undefined says Ok - I managed to get the privatekeys and identified the accounts by looking at the code.

There is a "funnel" and "sequener" and "validator" - accounts...

I noticed i can call 

```
docker-compose run testnode-scripts bridge-funds
```

This bridges from L1 to L2 - using the "funnel" account 

What are the sequencer and validator accounts ? In fact what is the funnel account 🙂 ?

Is there any documentation explaining what there purpose is and what we should be using them for ?

Thanks in  advance
undefined says The *sequencer* is responsible for ordering transactions on the L2 chain. It also posts calldata to the L1 chain. This calldata is what is used to reconstruct the state of the L2 from the time that the L2 was deployed, since anyone could "replay" the calldata to arrive at the present state of the L2. A *validator* is capable of making a "staked claim" and disputing the state of the L2 (in the case of a malicious sequencer). If you want to test out Arbitrum's fraud proof system, you would need to interact with these accounts to simulate a challenge. Otherwise you can ignore them. "funnel" is just the arbitrary name chosen for the pre-funded L1 account
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/protocol-faqs more can be found here re: sequencers & validators; and here for a deeper dive: https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer / https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
undefined says Ah nice, ok, so funnel is the one that interests me then  and I am safe to use this as prefuned L1 and transfer things over..
undefined says exactly
undefined says Nice, thats great. understood now. Thanks for your help.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Hey, Jason. Some days ago you told me that I can retrieve the l2 block range from the batch being appended in the tx from the sequencer to the inbox (in the rollup). As I understand, since the nitro release, I can get the batches involved in the rollup doing that. 

But what about the rollups pre nitro? How can I retrieve the block range or count when the tx is from the sequencer to the old inbox?

Thank you!
undefined says Hey, inbox contract is different from rollups contract, inbox contract is used to record tx on l2, rollups contract is used to propose rollups blocks and manage others rollup active. For classic batch search, it hard to do it with nitro node, you may need to use classic node which will provide you this. However, you can also call eth_getTransactionReceipt to get `l1BlockNumber`, although this value is not where the batch tx recorded, but it can give you a vague number (About what this value is, you can see https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time#ethereum-block-numbers-within-arbitrum).
undefined says Seems your node is syncing, just wait is ok.
undefined says L1 timestamp you mean block.timestamp return? This return is now the sequencer’s local time when this tx happens.
undefined says any update on error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
undefined says You can try this: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1060111245757390898
undefined says Ops, something may corrupt, can you try to send eth_blockNumber to your node to see what the l2 block number the rpc return?
undefined says Looks something went wrong with your node, yeah you can have it a try again.
undefined says What did you do last time? Just use init.url to sync the genesis?
undefined says Arbitrum doesn’t have mempool, so when you send a higher nonce to sequencer, it will reject rather than put it into mempool.
undefined says Hello! Quick question: Are sandwich attacks possible in the current state of arbitrum (with one sequencer and no mempool)? Thanks!
undefined says We are using first in first serve mechanism, so there won’t be sandwich attacks on arbitrum, if you use a honest rpc endpoint
undefined says Cool! Thanks for the reply.
Saw this on Twitter. Is it a bluff?
undefined says Unless this dude has his own rpc and he’s getting txs through there?
undefined says This type of people will always exist. I'm more concerned on not getting my txs sandwiched if they can be sandwiched
undefined says lol
undefined says yeah, that's alright for me, if it's something like not using a corrupt rpc. Thought there was some dark mev magic i didn't know of with a one-sequencer-no-mempool network
undefined says fyi @cid my node sync-from-zero slowed down immensely around the 27 million block
undefined says alright let me know how it goes im just gonna keep this rolling for now
undefined says quicknode is working alright until i get mine back up eventually
undefined says what is contract size limit on arbitrum?
undefined says Same as ethereum, 24kb
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Scam link. please help delete
undefined says The l1 node is just execution client is ok, and you can also connect to a trusted 3rd party rpc provider if you don’t want run your own one.
undefined says No benefit to run a fullnode, it’s also no benefit to run fullnode on ethereum.
undefined says The benefit I mean is no token reward, sorry for confusing
undefined says Your tx will forwarded by your l2 fullnode to our sequencer, this process doesn’t need to connect to l1.
undefined says Connect to l1 is when your node is syncing the state, your node will read l1’s da and compute the l2’s state.
undefined says What kind subscription you mean?
undefined says Ah, you mean query l2’s event using your node right?
undefined says That depends on your node’s performance (such as disk latency), your fullnode will maintenance l2’s state so when you query it, your node will read it from your node’s disk directly.
undefined says Your l2’s state will sync from l1, if you don’t have a honest l1 rpc, it may cause some issues on your l2 state.
undefined says because l2’s da is stored on l1, if you have a dishonest l1 you might read the wrong da of l2 then it will affect your l2 state’s sync.
undefined says This docs may help you: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-sequencer
undefined says Sequencer will put l2 tx’s information to l1 as da, then anyone can read l1’s da and recompute those tx then get the current l2 state.
undefined says The event is emitted during the tx execution, so when you know how the tx starts, you will get those emitted event.
undefined says So we just need record how the tx starts and the sequence of tx, we don’t need to record all the tx information such as emitted event.
undefined says You can find the execution client list from this site: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients
undefined says Np!
undefined says i have an issue with my docker start command. On my previous setup (nitro 2.0.7), i was using the flag  ```--node.data-availability.local-file-storage.datadir=/arbitrum/db```
i reinstalled from scratch on a new server with nitro 2.0.8
and it's not accepted anymore
```unknown flag: --node.data-availability.local-file-storage.datadir```
i also tested
```--data-availability.local-file-storage.data-dir```
But it's same issue.
undefined says Hey Everyone - I am working on indexing Arbitrum data in to a postgres DB and I was wondering if someone could help me understand something.  I am trying to understand the difference between effectiveGasPrice  & gasPrice. For example in this TX: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x3e0b33a3ac736d3ec829d5cfa5dd26ec3c309ae258ca6a0cca77ddad10af5f75. In this TX  it looks like there are Gas Price Bid (gasPrice), Gas Price Paid (effectiveGasPrice) are different values.  However according to this tweet:  https://twitter.com/timbeiko/status/1413536260962938885. It seems like those values should be equal.  Is my understanding correct?
undefined says hey please check with etherscan.io they maintain arbiscan.io
undefined says Hey! Just adding `--node.data-availability.local-file-storage.data-dir` should not complain about bad flag
undefined says dont quote me on this, but i think that you can bid whatever you want on Arbitrum -- but the actual gas price is gonna be whatever its gonna be
undefined says im not sure if the bid actually changes anything at all - obviously most networks it will incentivize your block position but thats irrelevant on arbi
undefined says nevertheless, arbiscan dutifully tracks & reports whatever the supplied bid price was - pointless or not
undefined says Thanks boxer!
undefined says 
undefined says Is there a guide to run the archive node on baremetal and avoid docker entirely?
undefined says I only see docker guides everywhere 😐
undefined says Yeah I'm doing it now, what a fkn mess, no wonder why they stick to Docker lol 😅
undefined says Although I would love to have guides for baremetal, I'll probably make one myself if I can make it work 🙂
undefined says 😄
undefined says What is this group about?
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/dog-smile-dog-smile-dog-gif-25692542
undefined says lol
undefined says Does arbitrum chain has mempools?
undefined says Where can I read about how to interact with the arbi mempool using web3.js
undefined says Arbitrum’s native/canoncial bridge (either one or nova) both don’t charge any protocol fee for bridging into/outta arbitrum from/to ethereum. The only costs of bridging are ethereum gas fees or ArbGas fees.

Is my understanding accurate?
undefined says I'm using my local node, and I'm trying to learn how nitro communicates with the arbNova sequencer. 
I'm how does *my node* learn about the new block produced, via what protocol? Does it do dumb perioidic poll for the new blocks from the nova rpc or it does something more smarter? Happy to read about that bit of design if it's described somewhere
undefined says Is this the right channel for the question above? If not let me know which channel should I post it in
undefined says You can follow this to compile: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says No mempool on arbitrum.
undefined says Yup, it only cost your gas.
undefined says The fullnode will listen to sequencer’s feed to know the new tx sequence information.
undefined says Not sure about this, will have a check.
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says What about arb one/classic? 🤔
undefined says classic snapshot：https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar
undefined says Not snapshot, but which repo to use to compile from source
undefined says what's up
undefined says Ah, this repo: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages
undefined says Nice, thanks 🙂 any dockerfile I can follow along to compile this? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Nevermind
undefined says I'm blind 😬
undefined says It's there
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Thanks, that's the answer I was looking for. So it's a ws connection as @cid pointed out.
I noticed(from logs) that sometimes my local node receives more than one block at once, skipping ones in the middle. Is it because my node too far from the sequencer?
undefined says Our minimum block time is 0.25s, so it also makes since your node received more than 1 block at a very small time period.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs hi,How can I get the information about the number of batches through nitro-node
undefined says Is the a method to check pending orders?
undefined says Did something change about ArbGas on goerli? Transactions that previously were 500k gas now are 5m gas
undefined says wow
undefined says Nothing has been changed on our side. But Goerli's gas is spiky a bit. 
Note that the amount of gas we charge for a transaction is 2 dimentional. You can read more here: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says Hey,
This happens because we're using load balancer. So when you send  transactions, the node received your second tx, may not be updated yet and you'll get "Nonce too high" error.
Something that I recommend is using JSON batch request if it's possible https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/batch-requests
undefined says Could you please clarify more. You mean total number of batches sent to L1 or sth else?
undefined says Np!
undefined says Our sequencer has a queue to keep transactions in line and send them in first come first serve manner. But this queue is private so you can't have access to the pending txs
undefined says Gotcha, thanks. This is a bit inconvenient for services that call functions with an unpredictable gas limit. You have to set the gas limit yourself in this case which, as it turns out can vary, greatly.
undefined says What type of tx do you want to send? If your tx's call data is same every time and not changing, then you can solve this issue by calculating L1 fee part separately and then do some approximation on L2 side of the gas
undefined says Let me know if the call data of your tx is not changing during the time, so I can help you with it
undefined says The calldata is different each time
undefined says And how can get data once the sequencer sends the tx in fcfs manner? Is this a kind of queue to get executed and unaltered? Where can I read more about this? thanks!
undefined says Managed to compile the binary with the Dockerfile, and I copied the nitro binary to host, to run it on baremetal, and I keep getting `error applying transaction` in my logs, with the db increasing in size
undefined says When running the official dockerhub nitro image, does it run anything more than just the nitro binary there?
undefined says 
undefined says small logs snippet of what I'm looking at
undefined says Where about in US is the sequencer? I have node running in Ohio and it occasionally gets two blocks in row, very much same as server in Germany
undefined says The batch number and transaction index information sent to L1
undefined says Once the sequencer confirm the sequence of a tx, it will send feed information to fullnode (current only fullnode can receive this), then the sequencer will send the tx’s sequence and it related tx data to l1, anyone can query it though l1’s inbox contract.
undefined says What is your start command?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L60
undefined says 
undefined says I wish I could post it here. The bot has other plans for me. 🙃
undefined says 
undefined says Ffs
undefined says https://pastebin.com/rGWp3K0Y
undefined says Okay pastebin worked 🙂 @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Did you set `--init.url`?
undefined says What does it need to be set to?
undefined says I thought doing --init.empty would've been the right choice to sync an archive node
undefined says This is used for nitro’s genesis state, you need set it if you start your node first time. And for nitro node currently you can only set an archive node with archive data after 2022/8/31, if you want to run a full archive node, you should also run a classic archive node (we have snapshot which can help you sync) then set `--node.rpc.classic-redirect` to your nitro node.
undefined says Ah, so no matter what, I have to start with `--init.url`, then switch to `--init.empty` once the Nitro node is synced?
undefined says If your node finishes syncing, also you set `init.url` it will ignore it.
undefined says ah, cool. then what's the `--init.empty` for?
undefined says Init with empty state.
undefined says So basically syncing from scratch, right?
undefined says Arbitrum one has genesis state so you need set init url. But our testnet arbitrum goerli doesn’t have a init state so it doesn’t need, can just init with empty state.
undefined says Ah, got it. Thanks! 🙂

undefined says Hey guys, do you have recommend rpc nodes service? We are often hitting the limit of official node and alchemy..
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/node-providers
undefined says I'm getting 404 on this on all of my machines @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says This for sure isn't an issue with my networking
undefined says Hmm, how about trying `curl`?
undefined says You said you can download it on another machine?
undefined says The nitro snap I can, the arb classic/one I cannot
undefined says `curl` doesn't help either
undefined says Ah, you mean this, seems this resource has been removed, i will check the latest url and share with you later.
undefined says Thank you, much appreciated ❤️
undefined says So I just can get data from the batch sent to L1 right?
undefined says Only tx’s da data, if you want state data, you should read tx’s da and recompute them then you can get them.
undefined says What do you mean by state data?
undefined says Like the data in smart contract. Tx’s da data only has the input of a tx.
undefined says And in what state of the transaction can I read this, I mean before enter the sequencer?
undefined says Sorry I don’t get what you mean, you mean mempool?
undefined says I want to understand the trade cicle and at what point of the cicle I can get data from the transactions. Also I want to understand what did you mean with state data and the process of recomputing it. Hope Im explaining myself properly. ty @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says I am trying to run an arbitrum node by following this page: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
this is the command I am running:
`docker run --rm -it  -v arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.9-51f9452 --l1.url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/7mIH8OvRP2fI5yPSPcQctjJ36rndvBAl --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"`

I created the volume `arbitrum` already.

The error I am getting:

undefined says You can read how tx circle works here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#sequencing-followed-by-deterministic-execution .
undefined says The log says you don’t set `init.url` , however I see your start command already set it, could you make sure that logs are the results of your start command,
undefined says About the difference of state data and the tx data, you can try to search Evm’s state tree and transaction tree (if you like, receipt tree also)
undefined says Whew, managed to compile arbitrum classic binary on baremetal, after 6 hours of debugging and tests. 😅
undefined says I think I could've avoided this by simply compiling it from the Dockerfile and pointing it to a local rocksdb library
undefined says :SCALEIT:
undefined says Got a few questions for you @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, regarding the two snapshots needed for Nitro and Classic:
1. the `--init.url` flag on Nitro is going to untar the Nitro snapshot archive when launched?
2. if yes, can I wget and untar in one go to save space?
3. does the same apply to the Classic snapshot archive?
undefined says I have few queries regarding rollups core functionalities. first one is:
Is rollup a sidechain made with geth which send its all transactions basic(.zip) data into main ethereum chain ?
undefined says also
I want to know how rollup chains send transaction data to L1/Main chain
where does transaction aggreegator ( bridge ) is hosted, which contain private key of L1's Owner of smart contract (onlyOwner).

Its centralised right ? or not ? is in embeeded in each node of L2 chain ?
undefined says Can anyone help me? I'm trying to run node, but I cant.

maybe try to manually download the tar and serve it using file://
undefined says Hey, Arbitrum rollup is a separate chain from Ethereum that provides data access by posting the data (in batched, compressed form) on Ethereum as calldata. 
To know how txs data is posted to L1 I'd suggest you read this:

undefined says ffs
undefined says still that error with local file downloaded, i'm trying over week, but can't how to run 😦
undefined says if you downloaded that last week we had a wrong file uploaded and here is how you can consume it https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1410#issuecomment-1372524001
undefined says Or you can download it again
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs any chance you guys can supply a working Arbi Classic archive snapshot? 🙏
undefined says Guys, could someone explain this situation?
You see, as far as I know, information on the asset's screen price reaches the DEX through Link oracles originating in the real world (offchain). If no one trades in the real world anymore, do screen prices freeze? How will prices move on the DEX if price information is tied to the real world (frozen)?
undefined says where is the location of the sequencer?
undefined says We can't provide any info on that unfortunately :arbiblobblue:
undefined says please move these sort of questions to #💬︱general 
This channel is a home for arbitrum protocol related discussions
undefined says I originally uploaded it there but was asked to upload it here on this channel.
undefined says I move RING token from ethereum to arbitrum one by arbitrum bridge, here is the txid: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdb787e8997d7b056a97e2db5d55381137549c1febf1be5edb74c372606286355
But there is an UI issue, I could not move RING token back to ethereum. @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs@Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is there an api way to get the `Submission Tx Hash` value of `L2 transaction`?
undefined says thank you, i will try
undefined says 1. Yes, it will extract it, 2. you can also do it your self 3. Same
undefined says We don’t have a direct api, but you can see how you can get it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/l1-confirmation-checker/packages/l1-confirmation-checker#run-demo
undefined says Refresh or clean up your browser cache, it works on my side.
undefined says Thank you very much. Is there a go version?
undefined says It’s a ts script, you can see how it works then re-write it using go.
undefined says After refresh and clean up my browser cache, it still has the error: `This token hasn't been bridged to L2`
undefined says Ah nice, okay, thanks! Super helpful mate! Thank you!
undefined says :CH_CatVibe:
undefined says Try click `Manage token list`, and disable all choices, then paste that token address to add, it should work.
undefined says Np
undefined says Sadly, I tried that, and the error still exist.
undefined says Please check the move direction is from arbitrum one to ethereum. @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says We just made a fix, you can try it now.
undefined says It works!
undefined says Hi! If I sent a retryable ticket, with some ETH in it, with the wrong calldata (so it'll always fail execution in L2). Is it possible to recover that ETH or is it lost forever?
undefined says I think I know the answer to that question, but might as well give the question a go at least
undefined says Does anyone have the weth ca for arbitrum Goerli testnet?? I cant find it
undefined says Which DEx support Arbitrum Goerli?
undefined says You can get ETH on goerli faucet and exchange to weth on some dex
undefined says Which DEx support Arbitrum Goerli?
undefined says did you solve the problem?
undefined says You can find it in the arbitrum ecosystem
undefined says https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says I have few queries regarding rollups core functionalities. first one is:
Is rollup a sidechain made with geth which send its all transactions basic(.zip) data into main ethereum chain ?
also
I want to know how rollup chains send transaction data to L1/Main chain
where does transaction aggreegator ( bridge ) is hosted, which contain private key of L1's Owner of smart contract (onlyOwner).

Its centralised right ? or not ? is in embeeded in each node of L2 chain ?
undefined says The beneficiary of the retryable can cancel it and they'll get the callvalue
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/IInbox.sol#LL131C22-L131C22
undefined says Rollup is not side chain, for your question, I would recommend you read this: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#sequencing-followed-by-deterministic-execution
undefined says Hey! I am getting an `intrinsic gas too low` when I try to do an ethSendRawTransaction. I took the same code that works for mainnet, but it gets the gas price from an arbitrum node (that is a constant 0.1 gwei apparently) and when I try to submit it I get this error msg. Is there anything I need to do differently from mainnet on arbitrum to make it work? (I am using web3j)
undefined says Hey, this is because arbitrum is 2 dimensional fee model, not only you need pay computational gas, you should also pay l1 part gas, we recommend use eth_estimateGas to get the estimate gas limit before each tx, here explains why: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says Ah, makes sense. Thank you!
undefined says Np
undefined says What if the beneficiary is a smart contract? Can the sender of the retryable cancel it instead?
undefined says I am considering trying to run my own arbitrum local node using the guide here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node. But as far as I can tell it says nothing about hardware requirements. Does anyone know what hardware is needed to run a local arbitrum node? Specifically disk space requirements. It does not have to be an archive node.
undefined says is IPC supported for the docker node
undefined says also is there a guide to build the nitro node from source?
undefined says for me arb1 currently occupies 250Gb, syncs in like 12h  even on SSD
undefined says Wow thats small 😮 I was expecting terrabytes!  I will give it a try then!
undefined says Hey! The minimum hardware requirements for running a nitro full node (not archival) is ~ 8-16 GB RAM, 4-8 core CPU (For AWS: t3 xLarge) and  minimum storage of 1.2TB SSD. But please note that the minimum storage requirements will change over time as the Nitro chain grows. It is recommended to use more than the minimum requirements to run a robust full node.
undefined says check that in year time 😉
undefined says Nope, but if it times out, the eth will go there too
undefined says Yep, you can use a bind mount to get the IPC outside of docker
undefined says i tried --ipcpath arbitrum.geth on startup but it said its not supported?
undefined says it's `--ipc.path` for nitro. `--help` has a full list of options 🙂
undefined says :dead:
undefined says thanks
undefined says np 🙂 it'll create an IPC within the container, but you can forward it outside of the container with docker's `-v` option
undefined says i looked in the geth docs instead haha
undefined says ✅
undefined says ahh yeah we use geth for its evm and statedb but we have our own CLI
undefined says it also supports loading options from a json file btw!
undefined says i added `-v /root/arbitrum/arb.ipc:/home/user/.arbitrum/arb.ipc ` and `ipc.path arb.ipc`, but im getting `2023/01/12 16:31:05 dial unix /root/arbitrum/arb.ipc: connect: connection refused` :dead:
undefined says actually do i need to forward? since im forwarding the whole arbitrum folder anyways
undefined says ah if you're forwarding the whole folder then it's fine
undefined says ah i got it, its one folder deeper in arb1
undefined says thx
undefined says is there a channel for full node support
undefined says You can just post here
undefined says I have downloaded the latest nitro.tar file and I am trying to run an Arbitrum node using this docker command:

`sudo docker run --network host --rm -it -v /media/pett3r/M.2\ External/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8549:8549 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.9-51f9452 --init.url "file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar" --l1.url http://localhost:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*`

I am running an L1 Ethereum Geth node locally which is accessable on port 8545. My Arbitrum data dir is "/media/pett3r/M.2 External". When running the docker command it first appears to work but then starts giving "Failed to edcode block body" warnings and then stops with a critical error saying "Failed writing batch to db".

What could be the cause of that?
undefined says @bharat | Arbitrum G’day! Our team is building the DeFi DCAing protocol in partnership with Kyber Network

undefined says Transaction was supposed to complete within 8days but still not completed why?
undefined says Is there a community version of Inbox/Outbox contracts that work with solidity 0.8.x? 
file in question:
`arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol`
undefined says using foundry, and trying to write some message passing contracts that rely on solmate (solidity 0.8.x), so i dont think i can use the 0.6.x version that Inbox/Outbox are currently pinned too
undefined says IInbox.sol is compatible with solidity 0.8.x
undefined says same thing with IOutbox.sol 🙂
undefined says was able to fix my issue by copying the interfaces! was able to ignore a bunch of openzepplein imports that were on an outdated version
undefined says ah cool 🙂
undefined says yeah looks like foundry will crawl all of the dependencies when i imported the Inbox implementation (`arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol`), and some of the dependencies were using an old solidity version so the compiler was complaining

didn't need the original implementation but just the interface 😄
undefined says @🏇cateye can you paste that transaction number here? (click the copy icon next to the number)
undefined says 大家好
undefined says anyone know if its possible to simulate & test cross-chain message passing using local test nodes (i.e. `anvil`)?
undefined says could obviously run 2 anvil processes, one ethereum mainnet and the other arbitrum mainnet. could use anvil forking mode so i have access to the original Inbox deployment (and dependency contracts like WETH)
undefined says If you follow: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node, it will deploy both an L1 Geth devnet and L2 Nitro devnet at http://localhost:8545 and http://localhost:7545 respectively; will need docker for it. The core protocol contracts will be deployed along with them: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node#get-core-contracts
undefined says any info on where i would get the ROLLUP_ADDRESS, something logged from docker?
undefined says yes it logs it out to the console when you run the script, it will look like:

undefined says has anyone figured out how to get around `intrinsic gas too low` when trying to deploy contracts to an arbitrum local dev node (using forge scripts)
undefined says I was able to avoid the `intrinsic gas too low` by using `--skip-simulation` and providing `--gas-limit 20000000` (20 million)

https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/3487
undefined says How to get community role please
undefined says Might be worth editing the documentation as it still mentions:  https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
undefined says assigned a domain to the eth wallet ens and entries in the deposit section in bridge.arbitrum disappeared, but everything is recorded in arbscan.  Developers please consider this detail
undefined says What are determines block time in Arbitrum? I saw that it is 250ms min but what about maximum and what are the parameters that go into it?
undefined says Also what’s the max gas limit per block ?
undefined says There's no max. If no user txs are coming in no blocks will be made.
undefined says 32 million IIRC, it's accessible via ArbGasInfo
undefined says the current speed limit is 7 million gas per second though, so if the chain has more usage than that, gas price will escalate
undefined says Thanks! When is block emitted? How can I predict when next block will be created ?
undefined says A block is emitted whenever a user tx comes in, with a minimum delay of 250ms from the last block. There's no way to predict when it'll happen if it takes longer than 250ms because it's just dependent on user traffic.
undefined says I think there are some blocks with one txn or some with more than one txn right?
undefined says Yes, if multiple txs come in within the 250ms minimum delay window, they'll all be included in the same block (up to the block gas limit)
undefined says Got it just so that I understand correctly.
Every blocks is atleast 250ms sec apart with one txn each unless more than one txn sent within 250ms?
undefined says And no block emitted if no txn received by sequencer?
undefined says Thanks for answering my questions @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs
undefined says is there any pruning for archive nodes?
undefined says hey,
I am a backend dev from https://l2planet.xyz/. Currently, we are working on a kind of live tps/gps dashboard. What I want to do is to get the latest 10 blocks and accumulate tx count and gas count. But it looks like arbitrum does not support getblockbynumber. Can you give me an advice about the issue? (I am using golang and go-ethereum lib)
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says I have a question re ETH sent to my Arbitrum smart contract from L1. Would the transfer work? If so, how to bridge or handle the amount? The wallet to wallet scenario is clear, I’m asking specifically for smart contracts
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#depositing-and-withdrawing-ether

your L1 contract would need to call:
```
IInbox(arbitrumL1InboxAddr).depositEth{value: 1 ether}(myL2Address);
```
(sending 1 ether from L1 contract to an L2 address (contract or EOA))
undefined says @donquixot.eth if you need to use Arbitrum's inbox/outbox contracts in solidity 0.8.x, you'll need to copy/define your own interface. trying to import the original inbox/outbox contracts wont work with foundry since those files (and corresponding dependencies) are solidity 0.6.x
undefined says re: bridging & testing:
I'm looking to test withdrawals from L2 (`arbsys.withdrawEth()`) against my *local dev node*

is there a way to speed up (or ignore) the 7-day withdrawal period with some sort of flag?
undefined says Thanks @saucepoint . In my case, I own the Arbitrum contract but not the L1 one. So the L1 does not know my smart contract is on Arbitrum and sends ETH. It's a possible scenario for what I'm building so I want to understand if it's doable at all
undefined says interesting. if you don't own the L1 contract, you'll want to withdraw the Ether into a controlling L1 contract (or wallet)
then you can route the ETH to arbitrum via the bridge
undefined says Ok! I'll give a try to what you're suggesting with Goerli ETH and see what happens. Thanks!
undefined says You mean `eth_getBlockByNumber`? We support it.
undefined says The parameters for `deposit` is not l2Address anymore, it doesn’t need param: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L371 , and if your l1 caller is smart contract, it will aliases your destination address: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L371, so if you want to bridge funds to l2, you’d better call   https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L432 with l2CallValue. @donquixot.eth
undefined says so if we wanted to bridge from L1 to L2 where the addresses are not the same, we should call `createRetryableTicket`?
undefined says also any idea on why i might be getting `EVM Revert: InvalidOpcode` when calling `arbsys.withdrawEth{value: 0.01 ether}(l1Target);` against a local dev node?
undefined says May I ask how did you build the local devnet?
undefined says Correct
undefined says hey all, I've been following the dev docs to create an arb relay which I think I've got two nodes listening to now (it looks like a normal node output). I'm pretty confident its working correctly since I'm up to date when comparing to arbiscan, but just to double check:

I would assume if the L1 inbox was being used (i.e. relay was bad) I would see the `inbox` messages over the `created block` message? And if the feed wasn't providing any information the timeout logic within the code should be kicking in (so I should see it attempt to reconnect). So without those sign-posts and I'm seeing the latest block I can assume the relay is working correctly?
undefined says If you can make sure your node is keeping the latest blocks status, you can make sure you are connecting to feed correctly, because if you don’t connect to sequencer feed, the l1’s inbox only has the tx seq a few minutes ago.
undefined says Ah awesome thanks! I'll create a quick test client to look for events on some univ3 pool and compare from there
undefined says I have been getting :```transaction type not supported```
Is is related to library then?
undefined says ```
    latestBlock, err := client.BlockNumber(context.TODO())
    if err != nil {
        return 0, 0, err
    }
    startBlock, err := client.BlockByNumber(context.TODO(), big.NewInt(int64(latestBlock)))
    if err != nil {
        return 0, 0, err
    }
```
To give some context, this is my example snippet
undefined says BlockByNumber  return the error above.
undefined says You can try this client to interact: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum
undefined says One more thing. Is it possible to tps by watching and processing batches if the window is large enough?(like 50 batches)
undefined says What do you mean by `tps` here?
undefined says H make tps higher?
undefined says tx per sec
undefined says Yea, I know, I mean  you want to calculate or make it higher? You just say tps.
undefined says I want to calculate and I am looking for a general solution at least for rollups on evm chains.
undefined says The timestamp for tx we use is the sequencer’s local timestamp, so I think you can calculate it by what you said. But usually we don’t like to say tps because each tx has different gas consumption, so we would like to say gas spent per second.
undefined says we plan to show both with different intervals(like 1 hour average, 1 week average)
undefined says so I was playing around with the relay - mainly trying to drop the resources (plus fun little task). I think its just forwarding the sequencer messages onto whoever has subscribed to the relay - however the node seems to always try and reconnect after some time even with ping/pongs (which I was under the impression are effectively a keep-alive). 

I cannot see anything within the broadcastclient which would do this (it certianly has reconnect logic however only on error), but I cannot see any errors within the log, so it would seem its expected?
undefined says used the `test-node.bash` from the nitro repo, using this link https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node
undefined says I don't have access to Sequencer's data?
undefined says You can access sequencer feed data if you run Arbitrum node
undefined says ```
Function: addSequencerL2BatchFromOrigin(uint256 sequenceNumber,bytes data,uint256 afterDelayedMessagesRead,address gasRefunder,uint256 prevMessageCount,uint256 newMessageCount)
```
undefined says What is message count?
undefined says what is the best platform to transfer eth from eth network to arbitrum?
undefined says how should send eth to arbitrum
undefined says This is message count after this batch, and it is added every time here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/inbox_tracker.go#L573
undefined says You can just use our official bridge to transfer eth to l2: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says You mean sequencer feed node?
undefined says when i call `arbsys.withdrawEth{value: 0.1 ether}(L1_destination)` within a contract (via a forge script), an error is thrown. But when i call it from an EOA using cast, it works as expected
undefined says on the local dev node, is there a flag to set challenge period such that L2 --> L1 withdrawals happens within a few seconds? testing some cross-chain messaging with foundry scripts and a local dev node
undefined says thinking the arbsys precompile is using an EVM opcode that **foundry's EVM does not recognize**. tried calling it using the native solidity `address(0x64).call{value: ...}(...)` but still getting the same InvalidOpcode error

for now i'm just gonna route the L2 --> L1 message via cast, as that seems to work
undefined says still looking for a solution on whether or not i can expedite the withdrawals on my local dev node(s)!
undefined says You can use devprivatekey to call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupAdminLogic.sol#L198 to set the challenge window.
undefined says no, a node (i.e. nitro client (not in relay mode)). I've seen them just "end" the connection without sending a close frame (websockets protocol) i.e. first time I'm aware nitro is reconnecting and my relay has a broken pipe on write. 

I'm assuming this might have something to do with the Ws implementation over the braodcaster client in nitro (since writing my relay in Python) - since I cannot see any point which would close the connection without a log.error() entry
undefined says How do you find they end the connection?
undefined says In Arb , why is there a prefix `b8xx` for `EIP1559` and `official 106` transactions to rlp? The first picture is `EIP1559` and the second picture is `official 106`.
undefined says Or what does it mean? I'm interested in it.
undefined says IT doesnt work ,when i push the bellow button a massage appear that ask for change network from arbitrum to eth main
undefined says please check: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585085215605653504/1064885423270268989
undefined says I am trying to make a contract with cross-chain messaging, but the  gas price on Goerli is high recently.
How should I do the dev and testing under this situation ?
undefined says Is there any alternative solution ?
undefined says Is it possible to fork both  mainnet and Arbitrum-net ?
undefined says been working this recently. you can run L1 geth + L2 nitro node locally with:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node
undefined says just be aware if you are testing cross-chain messaging *with foundry*, you'll need to multi-staged foundry scripts. also turns out withdrawing eth from L2 to L1 uses an opcode that does not work with foundry's EVM. but can work using cast

will have a write up documenting my experiences with cross-chain testing within foundry, but its  few weeks out
undefined says I'm trying to directly interact with the Ethereum Bridge via outboundtransfer() but not sure how to construct the input for the _data parameter. Is there any guidance I can read on this? 

It seems to be a uint256 and bytes encoded - not sure what the source should be for these values
undefined says Nice ! I'll look into it .
thank you so much
undefined says Hi! I'm having issues to run a local arbitrum node with a local L1 erigon. At start up I keep getting errors like `leveldb: not found` and `error reading inbox    err="message not found"`, and finally the instance exits with `error starting node: error starting inbox reader: failed to read init message`
undefined says Could anyone help me with this?
undefined says Hey! The data field should abi encode (uint maxSubmissionCost, bytes)
usually that should be an empty bytes
undefined says Hey! You possibly have a corrupt database. I'd suggest you start syncing again and always make sure to gracefully shutdown the node
undefined says tried calling the function using the private key from here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash#L42
(address `0x3f1Eae7D46d88F08fc2F8ed27FCb2AB183EB2d0E`)

when i lookup the `owner` of the rollup contract, i get `0xe2148ee53c0755215df69b2616e552154edc584f`. any idea where i can find the PK of `0xe21`?
not sure if this is a contract or EOA though
undefined says hmm that was a fresh try running it though, i also cleared up everything created during the last try
undefined says although i was sifting through the discord history and saw that it seems like the snapshot linked to on the docs was outdated?
undefined says i'm downloading a new one called "nitro-recent.tar" (300GB+)
undefined says hopefully it fixes things
undefined says Oh sweet, yeah try that and let me know if that works!
undefined says hmmm i'm getting a wall of "error reading inbox" this time
undefined says Thanks! How do I calculate max submission cost? Is that supposed to be the max cost for the tx?
undefined says Looking into this. Will keep you posted!
undefined says Sure! You could use this function from our inbox:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L361
undefined says quick question, is gas on arbitrum fixed to 0.1 Gwei?
undefined says also does anyone know where the discord tracker bots source their data from?
undefined says hmm it seems like a problem with my local erigon node but it's quite weird since i'm running it with the standard settings and have been using it locally for other tasks without any issues

specifically I'm running the latest erigon (archive mode, not pruned) with `--http.api=eth,erigon,web3,net,debug,ots,trace`. what exactly does the message "error reading inbox" mean? could it be there's some missing features of the eth node that i missed to enable?

when i attach a shell to the docker arbitrum container, i can make json rpc calls to http://127.0.0.1:8545 with no issues, so my L1 node is indeed reachable from within the container

is there any way for me to properly debug this? what exact json rpcs calls were made by the arbitrum node to L1? maybe i can try to simulate it with curl to test it
undefined says arbi client was able to get the chainId of my local L1 node as well
undefined says i tried using a remote L1 rpc and it was able to start syncing, however when i switch back to local erigon i'm now getting these errors
undefined says before my brief success with a remote L1 rpc I was only getting `error reading inbox`. after switching back to local erigon i'm also getting "created block"
undefined says i have also upgraded nitro to 2.0.10, same results
undefined says ~~does nitro require txpool to be available on L1 rpc?~~ not a txpool issue, enabled it on L1 and still having the error reading inbox errors

it seems to be related to InboxTracker?
undefined says solution for setting the confirm period / withdrawal time on a local dev node:

use this private key: `0xcb5790da63720727af975f42c79f69918580209889225fa7128c92402a6d3a65` which corresponds to the deployer `0xe2148ee53c0755215df69b2616e552154edc584f` (which deploys the rollup address `0x65a59d67da8e710ef9a01eca37f83f84aedec416`)

private key was the second wallet from this mnemonic:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/testnode-scripts/consts.ts#L5
undefined says (if anyone is attempting cross-chain message testing with foundry, i will probably have a guide and some reference code within a week or two if you can sit tight. feel free to reach out too)
undefined says Would anyone like to answer my question? Thank you very much.
undefined says Nope, the minimum gas on arbitrum is 0.1gwei
undefined says May I ask how do you sign your data?
undefined says I copied the Hash of a transaction directly from the block browser, and after using go to capture the transaction data, I directly used the transactions method in arbitrum geth, one of which is to return the transaction in RLP encoded format.
undefined says try with `--log-level=5` running a build off of this PR: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1441
undefined says let me know if you need help building a docker image from it but it should just be `docker build . --tag nitro` after you've checked it out and ran `git submodule update --init`
undefined says it seems the issue is that your L1 RPC isn't correctly returning logs from a log query
undefined says will try this and report back, thanks!
undefined says How to access
undefined says Hmm, we signed EIP1559 transaction like mainnet does, I don’t think there will be any difference but the chainId. Maybe is the way encode difference so you get that.
undefined says I'm running a nitro node with the --node.caching.archive flag but when I try to do an eth_getBalance for a block 18 days old I'm getting the missing trie node error. Is there another way to call this or is my DB corrupted?

```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "error": {
        "code": -32000,
        "message": "missing trie node 2f47f2cf4b8b0c834b51befc629d082d4b314f8571ecf07cdb9a7edfe4711f45 (path ) <nil>"
    }
}
```

The database size seems to be at 515GB right now
undefined says did you use a snapshot to set up your node or sync from the beginning?
undefined says Used the nitro snapshot tar to set it up, then it sync'ed for a few days after that.
undefined says was your node originally set up with the archive flag?
undefined says is the difference between arbitrum nova and nitro is that calldata is posted to external data source instead of ethereum l1?
undefined says maybe I'm not understanding it correctly
undefined says Essentially, that is the crux of it. On Nova the calldata is posted to an offchain Data Availability Committee, and only a hash of that data is posted to L1. To learn more, checkout our AnyTrust docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-anytrust (Nova runs on AnyTrust)
undefined says how is this different from using let's say celestia or polygon avail? is there benefits to posting to DAC?
undefined says maybe it is out of realm or connext hehe
undefined says is Data Availability Certificate the  hash of that data that is posted to L1?
undefined says I want to query arbitrum transactions and block info using my own arbitrum node (it is up and running). Can someone tell me what the best way/tool is? It seems like web3.js does not support arbitrum network.
undefined says I'm not an expert there but web3.js supports arbitrum from my understanding
undefined says I generally use ethers.js instead of web3.js: https://docs.ethers.org/v5/getting-started/#getting-started--connecting-rpc
undefined says yes, the DACert contains the hash of the data block, as well as an expiration time and signatures of the DAC members
undefined says I found bug how to claim reward for bug bounty
undefined says The encoded data is decoded by RLP in nodejs environment and the hash obtained by Keccak is the correct result, while the hash obtained by Keccak in go environment is the correct result. Only when the prefix needs to be removed from the contract and Keccak is performed, the hash obtained is correct. Can I think it is arbitrum geth's difference?
undefined says for one, AnyTrust can fall back to rollup mode if the DAC does not post a DACert in time. On an AnyTrust optimistic chain, you are trusting that at least 2 of N DAC members are honest. Also, AnyTrust is not purely a data availability layer as Celestia & Avail are. It is a full L2 chain
undefined says Immunefi runs our bug bounty program: https://immunefi.com/bounty/arbitrum/
undefined says Could you show me your code for how to process the tx and decode it, you can dm me your code.
undefined says How to access sequencer ?
 I could not find the function or api from document
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum hello! Check dm please
undefined says Don't see you there.
undefined says Please re-send.
undefined says Пам
undefined says I thought that too but searching "arbitrum" in the entire documentation had zero result.
undefined says Thanks. I will check that out.
undefined says Pew Pewed in DM 🙂
undefined says question regarding gas limit on Arbitrum: I've noticed that the gas limit on Arbitrum is not static and can change. Is there a formula or equation that I can use to determine the amount of gas limit I should be specifying as to not incur an `intrinsic gas limit too low` error?
undefined says also does Arbitrum support EIP-1559 gas?
undefined says also see our SDK for some Arb specific functionality like cross chain messaging: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk (works with ethers.js)
undefined says You can have access to the sequencer feed data if you run Arbitrum node locally. See here:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says I also have a similar question regarding gas estimation and Arbitrum's dynamic "gas limit" field...

I'm trying to `eth_estimateGas` for a transaction on Arbitrum. But my call reverts because I have other transactions that need to occur first before this one. So normally, I would use `debug_traceCall` to override the necessary EVM state to get the transaction to simulate successfully. But the output from `debug_traceCall` always specifies a constant, 20M, for `gasUsed`, which is incorrect.

For context, I'm building an application similar to Chainlink's randomness oracle. A user makes a request for some offchain service and also pays for the gas cost of the eventual callback, which delivers the response onchain. I need to estimate the txn fee of the callback before I make the request. This would be straightforward but simulating the callback fails without giving necessary state overrides.

So, I need another way or formula to calculate the "gasLimit" ... any ideas?
undefined says You could use `eth_estimateGas` to get the idea of how much it costs in gas for the tx to go through. See here:
https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/
undefined says are you using foundry?
undefined says I do use foundry, but in this case I'm trying to build the estimate logic in a Typescript SDK
undefined says Regarding the formula, I found this in a blog post...
```
L2 gas used + ( L1 calldata price * L1 calldata size) / (L2 gas price)
```
Some questions:
- Is `L2 gas used` equivalent to L1 gas used? i.e. can I estimate the transaction on ethereum to get the "gas used" component?
- Is `L1 calldata price` equivalent to L1 gas price?
- How do i determine the `L1 calldata size`?
- Is `L2 gas price` the denominator for the entire expression to the left? Or just the `( L1 calldata price * L1 calldata size)` part?
- Is there some existing code that performs this calculation that I can use or reference?

Source: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says re your questions:
- L2 uses Geth for gas calculation, so yes, it should be equivalent
- yes L1 calldata price is the L1 gas price 

you can use our SDK to estimate these components: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/447a2683c9d6ddb132a376b338cde1826df212de/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L73-L96 and you can use: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/447a2683c9d6ddb132a376b338cde1826df212de/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L98-L121 to just estimate the L1 component
undefined says the methods you want are `gasEstimateComponents` and `gasEstimateL1Component`
undefined says Can you tell me the address at which the NodeInterface.sol contract is deployed?  The docs say "0xc8" but it wasn't working for me.  Thanks!
undefined says "0xc8" is the correct address, but you have to note that NodeInterface isn't deployed on L2 and only exists in the RPC, but it contains methods callable via 0xc8. Please see here for detailed explanation:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas#nodeinterfacesol
undefined says @jaeaster was thinking through your problem a bit. since you're modeling an unknown future price for gas, what kind of delay are you expecting on the response from the oracle? have you thought about estimating some upper bounds for what the transaction might cost to post even in a surge of network activity and just charging that much for gas?
undefined says Could you share the complete log, are you following the hardware requirements. Is it a local setup or a docker image?
undefined says Initially the network of oracle nodes will be small, so we expect ~1s response time from the oracle. Eventually, the network may grow, which might result in ~5s response time.

But I want to solve for the simpler, low latency case and I’d prefer to not overcharge the user too much… my goal is to create something simple that works, then observe it and refine the gas prediction algorithm over time. Furthermore, if the network surges, my users would most likely be ok with waiting 5 - 10 minutes rather than chasing the surge price if that makes sense.

If I could, I would do (gas limit X gas price X 1.25). Will try this today with the insights from above.
undefined says i mean access sequencer document
undefined says You could take a look at these:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/sequencer
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/faqs/protocol-faqs#q-seq-vs-val
undefined says Yup
undefined says thanks
undefined says Hey guys I'm trying all the rpcs available but I'm having a timeout after few secs of deployments....
undefined says Even took a paid node, a bit better but not much
undefined says Anyone can help on that ?
undefined says I wanna run a Arbitrum node by source code,not Docker.But no document say how to do that? So could I run full node with source code ?
undefined says I think you will find YouTube video about it
undefined says Is there any sample code for manually redeem RetryableTicket ?
undefined says Only in docker 🙂
undefined says where can I find arbitrum's brand logo?
undefined says 
undefined says Yes, check out this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/redeem-failed-retryable
undefined says Thank youuuu!
undefined says what RPC are you using? what precise steps led to the timeouts? what specific error are you seeing?
undefined says sup
undefined says I'm trying to deploy a token contract to the arbitrum network, how much do I need for the deployment gas fee?
undefined says I have 0.0371 eth in wallet buy deployment still not going through, I keep receiving cannot estimate gas error
undefined says you deploying through Hardhat or some other tool?
undefined says Hard hat
undefined says Is the ETH in your wallet on the Arbitrum One chain? Or on L1?
undefined says Was using chainstack rpcs, but also tried quicknode and some public rpcs with good response time. Using truffle to deploy a set of contracts but ending in ESOCKETTIMEDOUT. Tried to increase the delays checks etc, but no effects. Sometimes it works but interrupts my deployment, sometimes it straight goes into timeout
undefined says Today i managed in the morning but afternoon was same, idk if it has to see with traffic
undefined says you might want to try Alchemy; but also how many contracts are you trying to deploy?
undefined says 10
undefined says So public rpc rate limit me
undefined says That's why I went for paid ones
undefined says I'll try alchemy
undefined says yeah let me know if that works better
undefined says Eth on Arbitrum network
undefined says In my wallet
undefined says Try setting a `gasMultiplier` on the hardhat config (https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config); you can also set the gas limit higher; does the contract deploy on testnet just fine?
undefined says yes, it deploys on goerli testnet fine
undefined says 
undefined says lol
undefined says Quick question:
How do I get the L1 Block Number with ethers connected to arbitrum?

I've read that transactions on arbitrum should have a l1BlockNumber field.

If I fetch the latest arbitrum block with ethers and subsequently fetch the first tx of that block, there is no l1BlockNumber field
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time#arbitrum-block-numbers the l1blocknumber field is found when you call getTransactionReceipt
undefined says It isn't there. I tried to paste the txreceipt earlier but your bot thought it is spam
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says This is on Goerli Arbitrum btw
undefined says if you instantiate the variable for that result of `getTransactionReceipt`, and call `.l1BlockNumber` does it appear?
undefined says I can't do that because I use typescript.
But I found that it does contain it if I do a RPC Call instead.
So the error lies in the typings of ethers.
undefined says Thanks
undefined says So the solution for anyone interested is:
undefined says yeah I noticed there's a PR open for this: https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/pull/3505
undefined says If you use our SDK, we've added a class that extends ethers method and have added l1BlockNumber and gasUsed to it:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/1d69e5f03f537ef9af7aaa039a28a00cf61b2fc0/src/lib/utils/arbProvider.ts#L85
undefined says hey is it better to deploy token on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova?
undefined says depends on your use case. One is great for DeFi and has more established ecosystem. Nova is  great for social or gaming apps that need even cheaper transactions
undefined says okay thanks, do you what is the current average deployment gas cost right now
I keep trying to deploy on Arbitrum One but it still says gas estimation error
Even when i try to use remix
undefined says the gas multiplier thing didn't work
undefined says can you call:
```js
const contract = new ethers.ContractFactory(...);
const estimatedGas = await ethers.provider.estimateGas(contract.getDeployTransaction(...).data)
```
and let me know what the value is for estimatedGas
undefined says okay
undefined says do I put the contract name inside the "ContractFactory(...)" and the "getDeployTransaction(...)"
undefined says Hey all, I am trying to run my own node and following this tutorial https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#putting-it-all-together. I was wondering if there is a more up-to-date snapshot file that I could download, since the one available in https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar is very outdated and will take weeks to fully sync to the latest node. Thanks team 🙌. Would https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar, be a better alternative?
undefined says Yup you can use the newer snapshot. We'll update the docs
undefined says I'm still trying to do simple gas estimation, and I'm able to call the methods on ArbGasInfo.sol, but I wanted to check something with you.  I called the 'getPricesInWei' earlier today and got this (the prices are converted to gwei for easier viewing)
per L2 tx    37983
per L1 calldata unit    271
per storage allocation    2000
per ArbGas base    0.1
per ArbGas congestion    0
per ArbGas total    0.1
Can you tell me why the 'per L1 calldata unit' is so high? is it really 271 gwei per calldata unit? The L1 gas price was about 17 gwei at this time. Thanks!
undefined says `ContractFactory` takes the ABI and byte code as params (alternatively, if using `@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers` plug-in and properly setup in your hardhat.config.js file, you can call `hre.ethers.getContractFactory(`${contractName}`);`) see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
undefined says and here for the raw ethers.js ContractFactory: https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/#ContractFactory
undefined says `getDeployTransaction` takes whatever args you want to pass to the constructor (if any): https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/#ContractFactory--methods
undefined says oh okay thanks
undefined says BigNumber { value: "307815" }
undefined says that's what the console logged
undefined says I want to run a classic node to be able to access archive data before nitro. How do I need to run the classic node to make it archival?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node
I followed this guide but there is no information about the flag needed for archival
Is it automatically an archival node?
undefined says Please refer to earlier posts: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1062374857628717097 the answer is yes
undefined says Ok so no flags needed for classic to be archival.

Another question: can I keep the —init.url on the second run? Or will it always re-download if the flag is present?
undefined says I want to keep it as that’s easier with a compose configuration
undefined says On Nitro
undefined says How long will it take to send a message from Arbitrum to L1 ?
undefined says ~1 week before it gets posted to the L1 Outbox contract; then it can be executed on L1 after that, see: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging#client-flow
undefined says I think it will redownload if you pass it in each run
undefined says It there any better solution when developing Dapps with L2-to-L1 messaging function ? It takes too long to test.
undefined says ok, make sure your `gas` is set to at least that value; give it a buffer and set it to 400K or so according to this spec: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/config or can try setting `gasLimit` on the deploy method via ethers.js: https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract-factory/#ContractFactory-deploy
undefined says you can run local dev nodes: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/local-dev-node ; follow this example for how to test once you have the nodes setup: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/outbox-execute
undefined says also some 3rd party bridges allow for faster messaging functionality; they have various security trade-offs, see our portal and select Bridges: https://portal.arbitrum.one
undefined says Are you sure/
undefined says That's a pitty
undefined says I'm not positive, but I believe so; welcome to try it, but I generally wouldn't pass it in beyond the first run
undefined says I'd suggest to change this behaviour then. It's pretty annoying to rewrite docker-compose files for the first run
undefined says If you want to suggest that, perhaps can open an issue on the repo: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues
undefined says Will do
undefined says what is the address we should use for the IUniswapV2Router02 when deploying a token on Arbitrum One?
undefined says can I get more information about the arbitrum protocol?
undefined says Uniswap is not a requirement for deploying a token; is there a particular token template that you are using that needs that? Or are you looking for how to list a token on Uniswap?
undefined says our full docs are here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/
undefined says heelloo!   Who know  how  deploy contract  arbi?

undefined says how big is nitro-recent?
undefined says nvm, i can tell its like 400gb or so
undefined says can you specify a download locations when doing the snapshot download?
undefined says I just wrote up a detailed post on setting up and running your own Arbitrum node from scratch (hardware, operating system, software installation etc,) based on my own journey of the process last month. If anyone is interested, you can check out this post: https://hackmd.io/@EagleEdge/B1wnRW5Di I hope this will be helpful for anyone who is interested in running their Arbitrum node
undefined says Hey all 👋  I am trying to run my Arbitrum node via Docker. I've been in the `extracting downloaded init archive       size=376350MB`  for 10 hours now. I also see that my Docker instance is not using much resources (e.g. 4% CPU, 100 MB of memory usage and very low Disk read/write activity), why is this process so slow, any way I could speed it up? Thanks
undefined says I am using `nitro-recent.tar` which is `394.63 GB` and the content of the `arb1` directory is currently `176.97 GB`, any help is appreciated, thanks 🙏
undefined says I'm just using a common token template I've seen and I think the reason I'm struggling to deploy it is because of the router address I was using, I just changed the address when deploying a second test contract to goerli and the transacrion failed even though I have more the 1 eth in the wallet on goerli testnet

what router address do you suggest I use when deploying my token since it needs one to be able to swap and add/remove liquidity.
undefined says Is there any way to test the `forceInclusion` functionality on a local-devnet or arbitrum goerli?
undefined says this is awesome!
undefined says is there any reason why, after downloading and initializing nitro-recent tar, it's now creating blocks pretty slowly?
undefined says feels like it might not catch up
undefined says nitro-recent tar ends' around block 40032961 or so
undefined says well the directory of arb1 should match the size pretty closely i think
undefined says so it means its not done extracting
undefined says yeah I understand that, but why it's so slow to extract?
undefined says perhaps your disk is slow?
undefined says mine took around 2 hours fwiw
undefined says I don't think so, since Docker disk read/write seem to be 2.8 MB / 0 Bytes, which is super slow
undefined says did you customize Docker in any way?
undefined says also did you actually extract the content of `nitro-recent.tar` manually or simply passed the option `--init.url=`?
undefined says i downloaded nitro-recent.tar with curl, then passed in the local file urlto that param
undefined says no customization
undefined says im syncing like 20k blocks an hour, seems slow? anyone from arbitrum team have any suggestions?
undefined says @EagleEdge how long did it take for you to sync after applying the snapshot, if you don't mind me asking?
undefined says how important is it that im using SSDs?
undefined says I'm interested in that as well 🙂
undefined says really cool, thanks for sharing!
undefined says for a Univ2 router, I suppose you could use Sushiswap's: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1b02da8cb0d097eb8d57a175b88c7d8b47997506#code
undefined says 0x did the full tar get downloaded for yours yet? are you running it from a cloud somewhere or locally?
undefined says ya i had no issues downloading the full nitro-recent.tar. It also extracted itself/applied itself to the node, so the node started in the 40million block range (november 22) im talking about it syncing to latest head from that now
undefined says aka, the rate of syncing after the latest snapshot block seems slow
undefined says here are some logs with timestamps to give you an idea:
undefined says 
undefined says ah dang can't paste logs?
undefined says `https://pastebin.com/k8JT1Gwd` logs
undefined says you can get a sense from those logs, it's syncing like 10 or less blocks per second, which seems slow...
undefined says > 40million block range (november 22)
bummer, was hoping for a more recent one
undefined says i mean it's still more recent than the previous one
undefined says i think previous snapshot started in like 20 million range
undefined says newer one wouldn't hurt tho 🙂
undefined says yeah, I wish there was also a way for the node to print out some % while processing the initial tar
undefined says It's been displaying the `extracting downloaded init archive       size=376350MB` text for hours now, wouldn't hurt to have some sort of % loading to make sure the node is not suck
undefined says @adedade what's the size of ur arb1 dir?
undefined says you can deduce the progress from that
undefined says yeah I am checking that, but the speed is not consistent, it was doing 1GB/1min before, and now that it reached 90GB it's a bit slower
undefined says Anyways I'll report back again tomorrow AM in 8 hours 🤞
undefined says yes, you should be able to test on either. If you run a local dev node (https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node) it will output the address for the local delayed inbox on L1 when you run the node; for Goerli, access the Delayed Inbox here: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x6BEbC4925716945D46F0Ec336D5C2564F419682C
undefined says i am running this node from the cloud but i downloaded the snapshot tar with curl to local filesystem, so am referencing it with `file://` in the docker run cmd
undefined says what kind of CPU are you running the instance on?
undefined says what is the address we should use for the IUniswapV2Router02 when deploying a token on Arbitrum One?
undefined says 4 cores 16gb ram(google cloud instance)
undefined says it didnt take long to at least setup the node so I may just try on a brand new instance + ssd tomorrow....
undefined says what template are you using to deploy?
undefined says yeah may help, let me know if that does speed it up
undefined says thanks i'll try it out
undefined says Regarding recommended minimum storage, I am currently running a Nitro full node fully synced and it has only 185gb. Why is it recommended to have 1.2TB minimum?
undefined says Hello! Im wondering if there is any documentation on accessing sequencer data while running a full node locally?
undefined says What are the benefits of running a local l1 node compared to using a node provider?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/sdk/classes/assetBridger_ethBridger.EthBridger#getdepositrequest
Is there anyway to specify the destination address in the `getDepositRequest` method here? If not how can I send ETH to different address on arbitrum from the address I am brdiging from on ethereum.

Bridge eth from address 1 on ethereum to address 2 on arbitrum
undefined says For future state growth. The chain is printing up to 4 new blocks per second, and that state can grow quickly as the network becomes more popular
undefined says see: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says Any idea what's going on here:

```
undefined says just having more control, lower latency, etc. You could also index data more efficiently if you're aggregating data from both chains
undefined says thank you very much!
undefined says hey peng, that particular method unfortunately cannot set a different L2 address. there are several alternate options, but they are a bit more complex in implementation. what is your particular use case? is this just a one off transfer? because in those cases it's usually easier to just deposit the funds and then transfer to desired address once they hit L2
undefined says Hey so I have an external drive with 1000GB so I want my nodes data to be stored there but I am not able to
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I am trying to run Arbitrum node locally via Docker on mac. Does anyone know why I see a sequence of `Generating state snapshot`/`Aborting state snapshot generation` /`Resuming state snapshot generation`?
undefined says I did `mount /dev/disk /home/ubuntu/data` and `mount /dev/disk /home/user/.arbitrum` but none of those seem to work
undefined says ie when I start running docker it starts downloading the snapshot into my root drive which only has 100gb
undefined says @Wichard had the same issue. i ended up download the snapshot manually with curl and then passing in the local file location to init-url in the docker command, if that makes sense
undefined says yes thanks
undefined says I am now getting `err="couln't open init '///home/ubuntu/data/nitro-recent.tar' archive: open ///home/ubuntu/data/nitro-recent.tar: no such file or directory"`
undefined says i can see the file is indeed in that directory though
undefined says this can happen if the node didn't cleanly shutdown, it should recover on its own
undefined says can you prefix it with `file:///`
undefined says I have. I think the mistake is that I have downloaded nitro-recent.tar in /home/ubuntu/data
undefined says oh you also need to make sure you have the proper permissions
undefined says instead of /home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says @Wichard that's the directory inside docker
undefined says sooo
undefined says lets say you do
undefined says `-v /mnt/disks/my-disk:/home/user/.arbitrum `
undefined says then ya you need to put the tar into that my-disk directory
undefined says and make sure that directory has full permissions `my-disk`
undefined says but then you still need to pass in init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum"
undefined says thanks, that works!
undefined says np 🙂
undefined says guess im now a technical support staff for arbitrum 🤣
undefined says haha, thank you for your help @0xQTPie !
undefined says np
undefined says just give me admin access to the sequencer and we'll call it even 😄 (just kidding lol)
undefined says it does take 20h to recover (it does print out and estimate)
undefined says Is there a way to run a node locally that doesn't have to fully sync but is still able to run transactions locally? I'd basically be like for the node to point to the latest block (and keep synching new blocks) so that I can run an arbitrum tx locally (don't have to be executed)
undefined says Basically I want to run arbitrum node locally, without having to sync the entire state of the blockchain, but just get next updates
undefined says what do you mean by the transactions not needing to be executed?
undefined says you want to fork the state of the chain and just simulate a tx locally?
undefined says > what do you mean by the transactions not needing to be executed?
needs to be executed/simulated locally, doesn't have to be propagated to mainnet

> you want to fork the state of the chain and just simulate a tx locally?
yeah, I don't want the node to have to be fully synched since it does take days otherwise, I just want the arbitrum node to start synching forward, e.g. from the latest node available when I run the node
undefined says are you testing specifically cross-layer messaging or does your transaction live purely on L2?
undefined says Purely on L2
undefined says if you're using Hardhat, you can fork the Arbitrum chain state, but you'll have to use an archive node from a provider, such as Alchemy or QuickNode: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/guides/forking-other-networks; similarly, if you're using Foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/forking-mainnet-with-cast-anvil
undefined says yeah I was already aware of that, but I'd like to actually run the node, be able to execute txs, and also make sure that my node stays in sync. If I use hardhat fork the node will be forked from a given node and never receive updates
undefined says when running a node that is syncing with live Arbitrum data, it is looking to the sequencer & L1 node to transmit and receive transaction data. It can't accept local state changes without getting into an invalid state. So how Foundry / Hardhat do this is by forking at a particular block number. This block number can be updated each time you run your test, to the most recent block number, but as you mentioned, won't receive updates. If it could, again, the chain would be in a potentially conflicted state (ie if someone simulated sending ETH from an address locally while an on-chain transaction moved ETH from that original address to a new address)
undefined says Thanks for the follow up, and just to clarify, my goal is to operate in read-only mode:
- Get latest node (without having to fully sync the node)
- Get follow up nodes from Arbitrum network
- Being able to (read-only) mode simulate a tx. The tx doesn't have to alter the blockchain (local or mainnet) state
undefined says in that case, if using JS/TS, you can use ethers.js's `callStatic` https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-callStatic, and I'm sure there's a corresponding method on `ethers-rs`, to simulate the result of a method call on a smart contract. 

You can also use the JSON-RPC method `eth_call` to simulate any tx: https://karalabe.github.io/go-ethereum/rpc/eth_call via the RPC ( `localhost:8547` when running locally)

But for a local node to work properly, it has to be synced. If keeping it synced is too much trouble, use a public RPC / API

Another option is to use Tenderly Simulator (https://tenderly.co/transaction-simulator)
undefined says thanks for all the help and various workarounds 🙌 I'll have to sync up my node I think 🥲
undefined says Sers, how can I contact the arb team?
undefined says could anyone tell me about what is L2 retry buffer?
Is this buffer placed on L2 or L1?
Is this buffer different from actual L2 data?
undefined says Also, can I really get overpaying gas fee to my Credit-Back address?
I overpaid execution fee intentionally on arbGoerli and the executor on L2 used 55% of what I paid and didn't send back left gas fee.
undefined says that goes to the gas refund address IIRC
undefined says it's part of L2 ArbOS state
undefined says Some questions related with determinism.
undefined says When proving, State Transfer Function(geth core + partial ArbOS) is compiled to WASM, then modified to WAVM. geth core is implemented in golang. After compilation to wasm, the wasm binary will contain system goroutines, including GC. Since golang is compiled to WASM, there will be no concurrency(no threading): (Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67575197/how-are-go-channels-and-goroutines-translated-to-webassembly), but parallelism still exist in final WAVM, because goroutine scheduling is nondeterministic(Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29057210/does-the-goroutines-created-in-the-same-goroutines-execute-always-in-order).
undefined says So my claim is that, **STF is nondeterministic**(which conflicts with the nitro whitepaper section 2.2: Deterministic Execution), so dispute may be occur when everyone is honest, which leads breaking the protocol. Please disprove!
undefined says How can we be so sure that the STF part(`replay_wasm=$(output_root)/machines/latest/replay.wasm` in Makefile of nitro) is deterministic(instruction by instruction) ? How can we prove it?
undefined says Okay. I self-answered the question. STF is deterministic because the wavm executor(which is written) will initialize and run wavm code. Assuming that the wavm executor is well written, goroutine scheduler will give exact same scheduling results IF WAVM executor is correctly initialized.
undefined says So even if goroutine scheduling is nondeterministic, its initial condition is same so it becomes deterministic. Something like a VM snapshot. Correct me If I'm wrong 😅
undefined says Hmm. But if STF itself is nondeterministic(other than goroutine scheduling such as syscalls), then it is still a problem. I ask again. **WHY is STF deterministic?** The nitro whitepaper does not have an evidence.
undefined says but the sequencer will add the transaction before the 24hour period passes, right?
undefined says No it would be a repeated case, where I am trying to send ETH  to a different address each time
undefined says Well, one easy way to show that the STF is deterministic is that every WAVM instruction is deterministic. WAVM has no concept of threading, and neither does the version of WASM we use. Go manages its goroutines using green threading, i.e. go has its own scheduler for its goroutines that runs in a single wasm thread. That scheduler of course has to be deterministic, because it compiles down to a deterministic instruction set.
undefined says in that case, you want to use retryable tickets. See: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/for-devs/cross-chain-messsaging#ethereum-to-arbitrum-messaging and https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging; you can specify an alternate destination address, but they are a little more complex to set up than the simple ETH deposit request. You can follow the Greeter tutorial for an example of how to construct them (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter). See: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/f971dfffd/src/lib/message/L1ToL2MessageCreator.ts#L149 `createRetryableTicket` method from the SDK
undefined says I’m a bit confused regarding duplicated transactions on Arbitrum.

When I request block with:
```
 "method":"eth_getBlockByNumber",
"params":[
    "0x451753", 
    true
],
```
It responds with this block [ https://arbiscan.io/txs?block=4527955 ]

There you can see the following failed transaction [ https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x1d76d3d13e9f8cc713d484b0de58edd279c4c62e46e963899aec28eb648b5800 ]

But when I request receipt with:
```
   "method":"eth_getTransactionReceipt",
"params":[
    "0x1d76d3d13e9f8cc713d484b0de58edd279c4c62e46e963899aec28eb648b5800"
],
```
It responds with another block [ https://arbiscan.io/txs?block=4512673 ]
 
So I have a few questions:

1. Why do such duplications happen?
2. Why they have failed? 
3. Are all duplicated transactions always failed?
4. How can I detect them?
5. How should I handle them?
undefined says yeah, the sequencer will process them by default, so to test that locally, you'd have to kill the sequencer's docker container(s)
undefined says @Paulo Camopy 
1. it appears the original transaction failed and then they attempted to resubmit the same transaction again the next day.
2. I'm not seeing the error thrown in Arbiscan, not sure if this tx was not indexed properly. But my guess, looking at it, since it's just a basic ETH transfer, it looks like it's related to the nonce used on the transaction (47). Typically nonces start at 0 and increment from there and setting a nonce too high from where you're at can cause a failure. 
3. yes, all duplicated transactions will fail. once a nonce has been used for an address that transaction cannot be valid again. 
4. the EVM will automatically detect dupes and fail them. under what context do you need to detect them? 
5. if you're running a validator as normal, there's no need to handle them. they simply revert.

undefined says to get maxGas for retryableTicket, I use estimateRetryableTicket in nodeInterface.
I currently put 1 ether in deposit variable and successfully get right amount maxGas, but what actually does this variable mean?

This deposit means actual deposit when I want to create retryable ticket?
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/ea891ba83f0f6d265d5967dc01c2177c48199d60/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L27
undefined says Why can't i post my project anywhere? Why did i build it, so now i can't post link to it?
undefined says Hey guys
undefined says are there any devs here?
undefined says We sometimes get "gas limit reached" error when submitting a tx using eth_sendRawTransaction. According to source code, the condition for this error is not enough gas amount left in the block for transaction to execute.

So, I am wondering what is the gas limit used there? On arbiscan, I see that a potential block in question
has 3 transactions and they consumed a bit more than 1m gas total https://arbiscan.io/block/54626254 . I am sure it has nothing to do with block gasLimit on arbiscan as it shows 1.1 quadrillion gas limit and 0.0% was actually used.

I am really clueless, what went wrong there. We use Relay service and such errors leave pending transaction in a queue for resubmission after 1 minute, which is unacceptable delay for our case.

I appreciate any help, thank you
undefined says zoy, this isn't the channel for that and of course we have to be careful about spam throughout the Discord. If you're looking for cross-promotion, please reach out to our partnerships team
undefined says yes, feel free to ask technical questions re: Arbitrum here
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Launched arbitrum classic from the snapshot. For 4 hrs it hangs like that

it it normal?
undefined says Is there a deploy script for the Nitro Bridge protocol that could be used to set everything up on a local network for testing?
undefined says it's about other protocol, but if you don't mind?
undefined says that is an implied deposit to go along with your retryable ticket; the reason we suggest 1 ether is just that it's more than enough to process any transaction. If you tried to estimate a retryable ticket and the wallet balance was not enough to cover the transaction costs, then it would not work. When you actually create the retryable ticket, use whatever values make sense for your transaction. This is just for the gas estimation
undefined says there is a 32 million gas limit on blocks (that 1.1 quadrillion figure is incorrect). How much gas does your transaction need to execute?
undefined says Thank you for your kind answer. All questions solved. I'm now wondering how arbitrum is such a small chain in size even having like 50kk blocks, pretty fast also. There is some wizard craft there hehe
undefined says It should start syncing right away after loading the snapshot; have you checked the `l1.url` that you're using to sync? is it accessible? is it accepting requests from the machine you're running on?
undefined says yes, see the `test-node.bash` script: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/local-dev-node
undefined says if its Ethereum / EVM related, yes. If it's a particular dapp you're interacting with, it's doubtful we can answer your question here
undefined says iota transaction
undefined says I got this kind of error Request error: [object Object]
undefined says it's definitely some solid engineering; we try to go into those details as much as possible in our docs: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/tx-lifecycle, one technique we use is data compression to achieve smaller data requirements
undefined says Yeah, can't help with Iota, sorry; have you tried in their Discord / Telegram?
undefined says around 1,5m. also, transaction gasLimit was set way higher by mistake, to around 100m but I doubt it matters
undefined says the gasLimit doesn't matter as long as you had enough ETH to pay for that much theoretical gas usage. Probably better to use a gasLimit closer to what you actually need
undefined says makes sense, thank you. I still can't get why we saw "gas limit reached" for the block though. I investigated dozens of blocks around the time of failure, and didn't find any where gas used was more than 2m, not saying about 32m
undefined says yeah we typically don't get that much congestion in the network where more than a few million is needed, since we print up to 4 blocks per second
undefined says yeah that is right, usually I see only 1-4 transactions per block. do you have any ideas what could be a cause then?
undefined says do you have the failed transaction? or did the relay just reject it without submitting it?
undefined says Relay got gas limit error from eth_sendRawTransaction call. That is what I got to know from openzeppelin support. so, I assume it was not actually submitted because of that exception
undefined says 100% accessible

`$echo $(($(curl -sX POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":67}" http://my_eth_ip:8545 | jq -r .result)))
16500475 `

it's eth last block
undefined says lol looks like 8545 port was busy now sync started ... how can I track sync progress for both nitro & arbitrum?
undefined says what relay are you using?
undefined says OpenZeppelin Defender Relay. I mean, a relay for gas free transactions. sorry, if there is any confusion with matching terms
undefined says what do you mean by both nitro and arbitrum? as the node syncs, it should log those blocks to the console, just look at the block number and compare with current block number on https://arbiscan.io/
undefined says zx when you submitted that transaction, it failed, then they put it in pending, then resubmitted it and it went through, right?
undefined says Failed writing batch to db 
why
undefined says my best guess for why you're getting that error is some kind of configuration on OZ's end; I would stick to using a gasLimit below the block limit and see if that doesn't resolve your issues
undefined says do you have specific error logs and details?
undefined says that's right
undefined says a quick question - it looks to me that tx gasLimit which comes in "gas" field is used for block gas limit checks https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/04714bce59a81d54d6f4bef69005a4c8a927c091/core/state_transition.go#L214 . or am I wrong here? However then it contradicts with 32m limit as our 100m transaction should fail every time in that case..
undefined says Every how many seconds arbi generates a block? Im getting more than one per second from Infura nodes
Is it possible to have empty blocks on the network?
undefined says Got it, when I used the get eth deposit request method on the sdk, and set the from address to the destination address, it worked as expected. Should I ignore this or can I continue to use this consistently without any unexpected behaviour?
undefined says How can I make the contract I issued through Remix approved in the Arbitrum network? Is there a contract givery on the remix?
undefined says We could not do it on arbiscan.io and we are getting an error. It's not improving.
undefined says 
undefined says ok, I have an answer for you; the gas cap does get overridden in other code paths if you grok through, but to answer your question as to why the transaction fails initially but subsequently goes through, there is a bug/feature in the sequencer code that requires these large transactions whose gas limit exceeds the block limit to be the first transaction in a block, to ensure they have the full gas limit available to them. So the reason why it subsequently succeeds is because it finally gets included as the first tx in a block.
undefined says that's something the team will probably fix at a future date, but for now, I would lower that gas limit below the block limit to ensure your transactions get included the first possible block
undefined says Definitely. And thank you for your help!
undefined says can you provide additional context? What happened before this / after this? what remediations did you try if any?
undefined says Arbi can generate up to 4 blocks per second, but it's not fixed, and a block won't post if there's no transactions queued up
undefined says it is possible to have an empty block if an empty message was sent to the inbox
undefined says did you set that to the same compiler version from Remix? just eyeballing that screenshot, you're using `0.5.3` as the Solidity version, which is a rather old version of Solidity
undefined says thank you!
undefined says Anyone know when chainlink VRF is coming to arbitrum? I have a project that requires VRF and polygon is junk and giving me problems, so I think I'm gonna wait for arbitrum
undefined says Hey, you can try use api3’s qrng.
undefined says chainlink is a requirement for this project
undefined says Thanks for the reply. So STF's determinism relies on WAVM's determinism. WAVM is a modification of WASM. According to https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/main/Nondeterminism.md, even if arbitrum does not use wasm threads, there are other issues which brings nondeterminism when executing WASM. So how did arbitrum overcome this? I first notice that arbitrum emulates floating point instructions with softfloat lib. But how can arbitrum avoid issues like; `Environment-dependent resource limits may be exhausted.` in the referred docs? Are those nondeterminism avoided in rust wavm executor? If yes, how?
undefined says Also, why did arbitrum team choose WASM? I know WASM is good(reason, https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#wavm) but can RISC-V also do the job? Did the team internally evaluate the instruction set? If yes, what were the criterias?
undefined says The solidity implementation never runs out of resources. If the prover runs out of resources, it simply aborts, and you must retry proving on a machine with enough resources (all you really need is 4GB of RAM to run a machine since that's the max WASM memory size)
undefined says We settled on WASM because of industry support and its easy ability to be sandboxed. Together those let us make the jit validator for instance, which can quickly and efficiently validate that the WASM state transition output matches what the node expects.
undefined says Solidity implementation never runs out of resources because, We only execute single WAVM instruction, at one step proof on L1 onchain(written in solidity). Am I right?
undefined says Yep, and solidity doesn't need to keep the machine state in memory, as it exclusively operates on merkle trees
undefined says We do have a computation limit of 2^43 steps of the WAVM machine to prevent it from running infinitely, but that's deterministic and synchronized between solidity and the arbitrator prover
undefined says Another question. So this means WASM can only use max 4GB memory when proving(general wasm limitation is 4GB: ref: https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory). What happens if logic needs more amount of memory then 4GB? Is it possible?
For example, If some golang program sorts list of integers whic is than 4GB of memory, what happens if this golang program gets compiled down to WAVM and executed in WAVM machine? In native environment(golang -> x86-64 etc), it would be fine. But In wasm, I think OOM will occur. 

I think all programs must have 4GB memory limit, because of WAVM's 4GB memory limit. Am I right?
undefined says So its normal that if I call blocks on arbi some dont appear?
560846010 & 560846011 are empty blocks?
undefined says Could it be doing this because the version is outdated?
undefined says I made the contract through injected. Should it be L2 Arbitrum?
undefined says Is there a way to reduce the size of the arbitrium data folder? l2chaindata occupies the entire space, about 360 GB.
undefined says Hey! Quick question:
If the caller in arbitrum, when bridging, is the L1 address alias, can an attacker replicate the alias (which is just L1 msg.sender + the offset) to go trick a modifier which would check for the L1 alias?
undefined says So this means you know the private key of address of address(msg.sender + the offset)?

undefined says https://github.com/r-cryptocurrency/moon-pixelmap-app
undefined says There's no way to sign as the aliased address if that's what you're asking
undefined says Your script is probably repeatedly querying for the most recent block number, but inbetween queries more than one block is made so it misses some
undefined says That's correct. Do note that the OOM is fully deterministic, and that we should never need 4GB of memory to produce a block.
undefined says Great. I agree that we do not need 4GB of memory when producing the block, but how can we be so sure? There are other logics, such as broadcasting txs to clients, compressing/decompressing calldata using brotli, and modified geth. How can we be so sure that those other logics does not use up 4GB of memory? What happens if there is a memory leak(well its low probability, but scary 👻)?
undefined says Also, OOM will be fully deterministic when it will be only translated to WAVM(since wavm will run in rust WAVM machine). So this means sequencer always proves(in wavm) and executes(in native binary) both? I inspected the code and it seemed that execution and proving is both done when sequencer is operating normally(not in challenge mode)
undefined says The replay binary doesn't invoke code to broadcast txs to clients (there's no p2p layer). Brotli compression/decompression is done with the standard C brotli library, which btw is in a separate WAVM module so it has its own 4GB memory separate from the main replay binary, not that that's necessary. Also, if there was a memory leak, you'd notice it just running a node, since it invokes the same code! (not in wasm though). IMO the best proof of this system is that we've fully validated every block in WASM without issue since the launch of nitro on arbitrum one.
undefined says The sequencer (and most nodes) doesn't run wasm, but all validators do, ensuring that they could prove an assertion before posting it.
undefined says So the replay logic(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/cmd/replay/main.go) is the only part that is used for proving, right?
undefined says yep
undefined says So it is not completely proved that the logic executed in replay does not require more that 4GB of memory. Although empirically nitro never failed to validate since its launch. 
If there is no memory leak(no linear increase of memory etc), but for example replay logic requires 5GB of memory(not due to OOM, because of its logic itself), it is a problem. So we should be anxious 😇 and pray that logic never needs more than 4GB of memory.
undefined says Why not wasm64?
undefined says Definitely there is a tradeoff(address variable size doubled), but we are much more safe(2**64 memory)
undefined says While that's true, it's impossible to prove just about anything in a turing complete language, such as the replay binary not panicking. I think this is a safe assumption given how battle tested geth ism and that a tx causing >4GB of memory allocation would be a serious DoS risk outside of the replay binary anyways. Do keep in mind if the replay binary runs out of memory, that's still recoverable by the rollup owner which can force exit the error state.
undefined says The go compiler doesn't support it afaik
undefined says I'm digesting `Do keep in mind if the replay binary runs out of memory, that's still recoverable by the rollup owner which can force exit the error state.`. Again bunch of questions:
Q) Replay binary runs out of memory (in proving mode) -> validators will all panic(assuming that validators only and always run in proving mode). Is this right? Sequencer will be fine because it executes tx in native binary(in execution mode).
Q) Since every validator is in panic, nobody can propose DA(disputable assertions). So challenge game never starts(because No DA proposal, so no DA dispute)?
Q) Can you clarify `recoverable` and who is the `rollup owner` in production? What/How are we recovering? Should `rollup owner` be `fund owner`?
btw I'm really appreciating your detailed response 🙏
undefined says 1) The validators could be updated to prove that the WASM machine enters the error state (though currently they'll never prove anything that their local node disagrees with)
2) See 1)
3) The rollup owner is the admin multisig. It'd take an admin action to recover from such a scenario, though of course we never expect this to happen
undefined says When you choose injected provider, it will show the network id in the next line, you can check if it is 42161, if not, you can switch the network to arbitrum in your metamask.
undefined says This document says retryableTicket is implemented for L2 reversion and you have a token bridge example.
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/L1_L2_Messages.md

I have a question about this.

If I deposit tokens in L1 contract and create a retryable Ticket and then I got L2 tokens, retryableTicket is succeeded and this retryable is deleted from L2 buffer.
Then reversion happens and this tx will disappear and I lost L2 tokens, but my L1 token is still locked.
And there is not retryable ticket anymore.

It seems same as if there is not retryable ticket. How you solve this problem with retryableTicket?
undefined says If L2 chain reverts, retryable Ticket is also reverted and turn to be available again?
undefined says Is l2CallValue for calling payable L2 contract from L1 in createRetryableTicket?
undefined says With an arbitrum-one classic node I get the following all the time. I wanted to run it so I have archival data for pre-nitro. Is this a normal warning? I don't think it is syncing as the datadir has only 4GB right now.

```
{"level":"warn","component":"monitor","stack":[{"func":"(*InboxReader).getPrevBlockForReorg","line":"553","source":"inboxReader.go"},{"func":"(*InboxReader).getMessages","line":"397","source":"inboxReader.go"},{"func":"(*InboxReader).Start.func1","line":"117","source":"inboxReader.go"},{"func":"goexit","line":"1581","source":"asm_amd64.s"}],"error":"can't get older messages","time":"2023-01-29T10:14:45Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-node-core/monitor/inboxReader.go:126","message":"failed to read inbox messages"}
```
undefined says retryable ticket is used for retryable, for examples, when you first redeem your token, it failed, but you can still redeem it again.(. So you won’t lose your token if your l1-to-l2 tx failed due to some reasons like gas not enough, it’s not used for reversion.
undefined says It’s msg.value in your l2 tx.
undefined says How about this?
undefined says Yea this also means if your l2 redeem failed, you can redeem it later.
undefined says You can check your l1 rpc
undefined says This usually happens when l1 rpc has some issues so fail to read l1 inbox messages.
undefined says ah, ok. Thank you.
So retryableTicket is needed mainly because users will pay gas fees for execution?
undefined says Gas price is too low or run out of gas are the most cases, but also in other cases the first try will fail, this is because the first redeem is automatic, so there might be some issues that is unexpected.
undefined says okay. I got it. Thank you so much!!
undefined says Np
undefined says Is there a way to reduce the size of the arbitrium data folder? l2chaindata occupies the entire space, about 360 GB.
undefined says is there anyone that is great at using the arbitrum block explorer API? needing to call on it and download a set of transaction data but am struggling. any help would be appreciated
undefined says We will support prune in the future release.
undefined says Any errors thrown?
undefined says About address alias in L1ToL2Communication.
Why do you guys have address alias?
Arbitrary address can not create retryable ticket if they don't have such functions.
and arbitrary user can not create retryable ticket if that contract doesn't have permissions to them.
And even you aliased L1 address, malicious users can mimic can calculate aliased address beforehand.

Could you provide some detail examples about the benefit of aliased address?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
undefined says Here is an example which is introduced in optimism docs(https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#why-is-address-aliasing-an-issue). Different L2, but the issue is identical.
undefined says > malicious users can mimic can calculate aliased address beforehand.
This is false. There no way that the attacker to find out the private key of aliased address. Its because of the cryptographic property.
undefined says i understood! Thank you!
undefined says so theres not any errors but the data I am getting back doesnt seem right. I am actually using Alchemy - do you recomending doing something else?
undefined says ie Arbiscan
undefined says basically I am trying to write a script that allows me to take the transaction history for a certain period of time and then later filter this to see what % of these transactions are GMX based. wanting to also visualize this later on but thats not as important as getting the raw data into a format I can play with (CSV/JSON). any advice would be much appreciated
undefined says There are different ways to do that. I think free tier in node providers will rate limit you if you have lots of queries and this is why that doesn't work.
I would recommend using Arbiscan API. https://docs.arbiscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts
undefined says In some cases using Log api works best for you, if you are looking for specific type of tx that emits an event https://docs.arbiscan.io/api-endpoints/logs
undefined says awesome I will check this out for sure
undefined says seeing something similiar, did you find a fix?
undefined says How long ago is the block you are querying
undefined says i'm using foundry to execute a tx on foundry-evm
undefined says not sure how long back the trie must go ?
undefined says You mean you use foundry to fork arbitrum and execute tx on that forked network?
undefined says Or just execute tx using foundry and send it to arbitrum?
undefined says yes
undefined says the former
undefined says The execution way is eth_sendTransaction or others rpc methods?
undefined says _getStorageAt mainly
undefined says Do you input blockNumber parameter? (The third parameter)
undefined says no i do not
undefined says Ok, could you share with me the code you sent eth_getStorageAt?
undefined says According to your tweet, https://twitter.com/PlasmaPower0/status/1578804137994915840, 
> It's not just less hashing, you actually don't need to execute any blocks in WASM that aren't in dispute! We still execute them anyways to ensure safety, but it's not necessary to participate in the rollup.
So for "safety", validators run wavm using wavm jit machine, even though STF can be run natively(native architecture) when there is no dispute. Is this right?
I think native run(not executing wavm) can be done because assertion check is only done using state root, not the intermediate state of STF. Validators can post assertions by just running STF natively. Is this correct?
Also, can you clarify "safety"? I think it is more safe because normal execution environment is much closer when dispute has occured, both in wavm. Also, by always executing in Wavm, it provides determinism between every instructions(Not required when no dispute. Validators will only compare assertion state not intermediate state).
undefined says who is the block processor of arbitrum(L2)?
undefined says where can i see L2 sate data created by validators or Rblocks?
undefined says You can read those information here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35#readProxyContract, the rblock you can call by `getNode` with the node number, and the node's parameters are here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/Node.sol
undefined says The block you mean rblock? It is produced by validators(must stake).
undefined says the block can see on arbitrum scan not rblock
undefined says Oh, you mean the block you see from arbiscan? It is produced by arbos, you can see those produce tx like this: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x65023af8d4101b2a5a5b95f0cb776f3d930a7ca68eee62b3f5eeef08aec38059
undefined says my question is which node creates block. ex) in pow certain node that found the right nonce creates blocks
who create block and broadcast
undefined says does arbitrum have centralized arbos machine? or sequencer does this?
undefined says Sequencer does this.
undefined says if sequencer is down, is arbitrum down too?
can't messaging L1 and L2 each other and  arbitrum block processing
undefined says Arbitrum won’t down because we have 2 type of inbox, one is sequencer inbox another is delayed inbox, user can choose send l2 tx to delayed inbox also, for more details: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#inboxes-fast-and-slow, we also have a tutorial show how this works: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg
undefined says if sequencer is down, who creates block instead sequencer? 
all of users can create block if L2 tx data is recored on ethereum by delayed inbox?
undefined says The block is not like l1’s block, and we also don’t have the concept like block limit and fixed block time on l2, we only limit single tx’s gas to 32m, so if don’t have StartBlock tx, the state of l2 can also promote if we know the order of tx.
undefined says if i sent L2 tx to delayed inbox and 24 hours passed, i can force it to be promoted into the main inbox and i did it. then the node (any node can be) watching delayed inbox create block and include my L2 tx in it?
how can i see  my tx is operated?
undefined says Each honesty node you can query and will find your tx.
undefined says are honesty nodes watching inbox contracts?
in this case, can i see my tx on arbitrum scan?
in arbitrum tx's block can be empty?
undefined says 1. sequencer will sync it and feed to those node.
2. If node doesn’t connect to sequencer feed, they will read inbox directly.
undefined says if sequencer is down, block processing is stopped right?
undefined says You don’t need to emphasize block on arbitrum, the state promote isn’t decide by block production like l1, however, once your tx record on l1 inbox, we can know the order of your tx and then we will know the latest state by execute those order of tx.
undefined says in nitro node options what does block-by-block validation mean?
is this different from state validators?
undefined says ` --node.block-validator.enable          enable block-by-block validation`
undefined says Hi! I'm having issues with my nitro node, constantly receiving the message "error reading inbox" - "invalid argument 1: at least one of BlockNumber or BlockHash is needed if a dictionary is provided" - is there a known fix to this?
undefined says your L1 node isn't accepting the nitro node's queries. Try a different one
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs thanks! that was the issue, picked a different RPC server
undefined says Hey , im a begginer in solidity so sorry for asking noob questions , but i was coding my first Smart contract and i took a bunch of code from a tutorial. I was wondering if it is possible for a malicious user to insert a function in the contract that sends him directly  my private key , hope my question is clear , thanks for your help
undefined says @TheAleks generally no; when you send transactions to a smart contract, you're sending a signature, not your private key itself. The thing you may have to watch out for with smart contract interactions is signing approvals for tokens. If you're signing an approval for a known / audited contract like Uniswap, usually its a safe thing to do, but sometimes scammers trick people into signing approvals that are malicious. You can check for approvals you've granted on Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker and revoke your approvals there. 

Usually the only way a private key is exposed is by a user copying it into some web app that's asking for it (no one should ever ask you for it) or by sharing a screenshot of a seed phrase (one method that phishers often use). The only time you should ever type your private key / seed phrase anywhere is when you are restoring a wallet on a new device.
undefined says When developing smart contracts locally, sometimes you have to enter a private key for the deployment on a local `.env` file. That file should stay local (don't check it into Github), but also, you should use a separate wallet for developing vs the wallets you use to hold the majority of your assets
undefined says Thank you for answering my question it helps me a lot, so is there a way that the contract that i want to deploy contains a function that sends the private key of signer to an external adress (me)? And could you please tell me how malicious token approvals do to get the signer's private key ? Sorry the terrible english , im French ! Thank you !
undefined says Btw, do you have a tool to check if a contract contains a private key extraction function ?
undefined says Answers from everyone are welcome !
undefined says no, contracts cannot directly ask for a or pull the private key of a user. Wallets are designed to not expose the private key when signing a transaction. furthermore smart contracts don't "send" data to anyone, they post data on the blockchain, and that data is visible by everyone. if a private key was ever posted on the blockchain it would be likely intercepted by a number of bots and that wallet would be promptly drained.
undefined says Very good
undefined says malicious token approvals do not work by obtaining a signer's private key. They work, because when you sign an approval, you are authorizing another address to spend tokens on your behalf. This is necessary for some smart contracts to work. For example, when you perform a swap on Uniswap, you first have to authorize the Uniswap contract to spend your (for example, USDC) token to swap for the other token you want.
undefined says so a malicious approval is one which tricks the user to grant a malicious contract or wallet address to spend tokens with the intent of stealing those tokens
undefined says whenever a signature comes up on Metamask or whatever wallet you use, make sure you understand what you are signing. If it does not make sense to you, reject the transaction
undefined says this is giving me a 404 error
undefined says also I get this when trying to retrieve and extract ``https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar``

```curl: (18) transfer closed with 545441501088 bytes remaining to read
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
```
undefined says Can anyone please answer this question?
undefined says This is classic archive db snapshot, and it’s moved to https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar, and it seems work fine at my end, if you just run nitro node, no need to download it.
undefined says Arbitrum is first-in-first-serve model, and there are not mempool like mainnet. Also, sequencer handles tx 7m/s, and minimum block time is 0.25s. If lots of tx come at the same time, sequencer will reject some tx and don’t store it in like mempool things, the reason why get lots of tx might because some network issues, could you share with me those arbiscan pages?
undefined says 7m gas per second
undefined says It has errors thrown: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/97886aa8813c5810bdcb37a6f9710f2836c88dff/core/error.go#L60
undefined says Sure
undefined says how to connect sequencer feed web socket?
```
w = new WebSocket("wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed")

WebSocket connection to 'wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed' failed
```
undefined says How dose arbitrum compress l2 data? Is there any doc?
undefined says We now only allow fullnode to query it, but you can also run your own relay node to query this: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#arb-relay
undefined says Use brotli: https://github.com/google/brotli/tree/f4153a09f87cbb9c826d8fc12c74642bb2d879ea
undefined says Got it, thanks
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs how can i see sequencer's raw feed messages?
i can see only dbug message  on relay node with log-level 5
undefined says see: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says it doesn't describe how to see those messages in that link? or am I missing something?
undefined says Joined
undefined says click into the Arb-Relay section, and run your node as a relay: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#arb-relay (the first command there)
undefined says I am running it as a relay, but I don't see any sequencer messages.
undefined says what command did you run specifically?
undefined says used this command:
docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3 --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed --l2.chain-id=42161
undefined says I see the same as him on debug level 5, but no raw feed messages.
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs I tried to connect to the arb-relay on port 9642 with wscat -c wss://127.0.0.1:9642, but I this error: error: Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection was established.
undefined says if I am doing something completely wrong let me know, haven't dabbled too much in this before.
undefined says you're on the right track, but there have been some recent changes. hold up while I get a complete response for you. What nitro version are you running, by the way?
undefined says 2.0.10-73224e3
undefined says Hat
undefined says @jornx can you DM me / add me? question for you in your DMs
undefined says ok
undefined says says I can't DM you (only as friend) sent a friend request
undefined says can i get a document about l2msg spec in sequencer message?
undefined says 😆
undefined says We have a tutorial show how to use it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg
undefined says if i don't use `--node.forwarding-target` option on nitro, then my nitro can't accept users' tx requests?
if not, does nitro have hardcoded default sequencer uri?
undefined says We have a default url for this to allow you connect to sequencer rpc.
undefined says Hello:)
Trying to see, what's inside sequencer's feed, but can't understand, how can I do this.
There's synced nitro node, v2.01.10-73224e3, as already mentioned in this thread.
Is there any example in python, or something like this?
Currently trying to connect via websockets lib to 'ws://host:port/feed'. If I connect to 'ws://host:port', I can subscribe to new headers.
Can I do something like this for transactions in Sequencer?
undefined says Hey, you can send your CV through the link available in #🤝︱careers
undefined says if you're running a relay as described: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#feed-relay you connect with a websocket client from your terminal to ws://127.0.0.1:9642
undefined says Oh, thanks. Do I understand right: I can run another docker container as a relay without stopping current node? I can change settings later, but currently I'd just like to check how does it work.
undefined says yes, but then you can link your node up to the relay later. Generally, you should only run one relay per machine; you can connect one or more nodes to your Feed Relay
undefined says Understood, thanks 🙂
undefined says Well, I'm trying to run it via docker-compose, but seems like I miss something. Should docker-compose file look like this?
```version: '3.9'

services:

  feed_relay_nitro:
      image: offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3
      container_name: feed-relay-arbitrum
      entrypoint: relay
      command: |
        --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0
        --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed
      ports:
        - "9642:9642"```
And does it need any volume for work?
undefined says your docker compose should not need any changes, it should be identical to the repo: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml
undefined says run the first command on this section (https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#feed-relay) to spin up a relay, then separately in another terminal, just use a websocket client to connect to that relay:  `wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:9642`
undefined says Docker-compose from my message seems exactly the same as `docker run` command, doesn't it? But I see logs `Sample usage: relay --node.feed.input.url=<L1 RPC> --l2.chain-id=<L2 chain id>`
undefined says I think it should look like:
```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  feed_relay_nitro:
    command:
    - offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3

    image: relay
    ports:
    - 0.0.0.0:9642:9642

    tty: true
```
undefined says I've tried `docker run --rm -it  --name feed-relay-arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3 --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`
I see the same error, as using docker-compose `Sample usage...`
undefined says The only difference with the command in documentation is `--name` flag 🙂
undefined says ok, you just need to add `--l2.chain-id=42161` as a param
undefined says (for Arb One)
undefined says Thanks, now it works:)
undefined says Looks like original documentation page need some fix in that example command 🙂
undefined says agreed, thanks will do
undefined says Can anyone help me
undefined says How can I fund my arbitrum wallet with usdt/usdc instead of eth?
undefined says Just swap your ETH to USDT once you have it bridged
undefined says these types of questions should be directed to #📬︱support , this channel is for coding / developer / infrastructure questions; but yes you can use Uniswap or Sushi (or any other DEX) or you can bridge USDT / USDC directly from L1 as well from our bridge: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/

undefined says Hey, I am trying to use multicall to get a bunch of balances and i am getting this error which makes no sense because its a view function:

ValueError: {'code': -32000, 'message': 'err: intrinsic gas too low (supplied gas 50000000)'}
undefined says fixed.
undefined says nice good to hear; what was the issue?
undefined says what functions are you calling?
undefined says btw I would not use multicall just for reading balances. Just use your client library (ie ethers.js / ethers-rs, etc) for that. The `aggregate` methods on multicall are all payable functions so they must execute on chain
undefined says unless this is for use within a smart contract
undefined says I am just calling getBalance
undefined says I've done this with ethereum mainnet plenty before
undefined says it is way faster when you are checking like 5000 balances to use multicall
undefined says you're making a single call to `getEthBalance`? or are you calling `aggregate` against those calls?
undefined says aggregate with a bunch of get balance calls
undefined says using multicall.py
undefined says https://github.com/banteg/multicall.py
undefined says i noticed there is a seperate function for just eth balance today though, maybe i should be calling that?
undefined says what happens if you add another 0 to that `GAS_LIMIT`?
undefined says Oh
undefined says How does that work? It is not doing anything that changes state, so how is it using gas?
undefined says but ya let me see
undefined says I've never used multicall in the way you're describing, but first try to do it with ie 10 addresses instead of 5K. Does it work? if so, increase. You may be hitting some execution limit on "virtual execution"
undefined says ya, i will .. actually doing 1000 at a time , it definitely should be able to handle that. On eth main net it usually starts bugging out around 3k. Adding another  produces a similar  cryptic error: "ValueError: {'code': -32000, 'message': 'err: intrinsic gas too low (supplied gas 300000000)'}"
undefined says Hmm, even running just 10 of them gives the same error. I will try calling the contracts built in ethBalance , maybe that is there for a reason
undefined says which contract do you call on mainnet and which one are you calling on Arb?
undefined says they are all listed here ... oh there are different versions too https://github.com/banteg/multicall.py/blob/master/multicall/constants.py
undefined says yeah that's what I was wondering, if you were normally hitting multicall1 on L1 and multicall3 has differences
undefined says Did you change it to their url snapshot? As you had a local file path earlier.
undefined says Is there a way to backup my current node data  so when I make a new node I can point the initial snapshot to that file which Contains chain data that's up to date instead of a 5 month old snapshot that you offer?  As syncing after the snapshot takes like 2 days.
undefined says Does native ETH of arbitrum support erc20 functions?
undefined says no you need to wrap it, use the WETH contract: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x82aF49447D8a07e3bd95BD0d56f35241523fBab1
undefined says K is there any way to use WETH to pay gas rather than ETH. Some L2 provide that functionality.
undefined says unfortunately not yet, but it is something we're looking to add in the future
undefined says Thank you @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs that clears my doubts for now.
undefined says `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3` this image works fine for testnet node?
undefined says 
undefined says That image works fine for Goerli, yes. Can you post the complete command you're using?
Also, in the last argument, you're specifying the feed for Arbitrum One, not Goerli, which is `wss://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/feed`
undefined says got it, let me update wss goerli feed.
undefined says thx

undefined says how to increase sync speed, it's been 10 days and it's still at 25m block
undefined says Ran out of disk space on my node, added more and it went to continue without any issues. The node software has improved A LOT! No more sync from beginning, always works.
undefined says gj
undefined says I would even go as far as to say it is the most stable node I've ran. And I've ran a lot.
undefined says What hardware specs are you using for your node?
It does take a while to completely sync, but maybe you can speed it up tweaking your setup a bit. Also, take a look at the minimum requirements to run a node => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration
undefined says Anyone know the disk-space requirements for a full archive node?
undefined says why is it so painful to sync a node? a regular snapshot would be quite useful
undefined says recommended at least 1.3 TB
undefined says ok, not as bad as I was expecting, thanks!
undefined says hey frens we figured that the snapshot download for classic is 50% bigger than syncing a archive node with the default checkpoint parameter from scratch. so we where thinking if the snapshot maybe contains more checkpoints and we can optimize the parameter to have faster graph node indexers?
undefined says for the People who are running a node, should they fill a Form out?
undefined says Where is located the sequencer
undefined says Your synced node might be auto pruned.
undefined says It’s in US
undefined says i got a node in the EU, i would be better of by just deploying a relay in the US to check the sequencer with the least latency right?
undefined says That would help a bit, but not sure how much
undefined says Whats the link to the latest arbitrum node snapshot?
undefined says I'd like a way to onboard users without them having to fund a wallet first. Are there any standards for EVM compatible chains for me to submit operations signed by my users on their behalf?
undefined says is there any way to query the sequencer to find the current pending tx set count?
undefined says or get the whole set?
undefined says I tried to post a technical question and it's being blocked by the channel. Who can I ask a deep question about gas computation on-chain?
undefined says Friends, do you think it is possible to buy this token? https://arbiscan.io/address/0x14b0D1Af06685eb82D043f3c80659eF74256c258
undefined says I want to use getLogs to fetch the events for the past 8 days. getLogs expects a starting block (fromBlock) and my plan was to do `current_block - blocks_per_day * 8`. I'm not sure however how many blocks are produced daily on arbitrum? My calculations show about 229k blocks per day, but there is no official number on how often blocks are produced? I have the feeling that this is dynamic depending on how many transactions are being submitted? Is this correct? Can someone point me to docs?
undefined says This is the latest snapshot https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
Noted that this is just for full nodes not archive
undefined says There are multiple models and ideas. Take a look at account abstraction ideas on Ethereum chains
undefined says No, it's private for now
undefined says Thanks! Sometimes all it takes is knowing the right key words to search for 😄
undefined says I think that's because you said H I or sth like that on your message. We're blocking those messages to prevent bots spamming. Post the Q here please
undefined says haha, hard to find this one :arbjak:
undefined says Yeah exactly. It depends on the transaction that are submitted. We just have a min block production time period (now it's 250 ms) but we'll create blocks whenever we receive txs, and it's completely based on demand
undefined says How would we go about being listed on Guild.xyz/arbitrum for GMD Protocol ? @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs
undefined says You need to check #✅︱roles channel!
undefined says Hey there! We'll soon deploy on Arbitrum (we are already on 3 EVM chains), we have a B2B business model, is there business dev support that could facilitate the connection with Arbitrum protocols?
undefined says Hey,
Could you drop an email to **partnerships@offchainlabs.com **please?
undefined says That's what we've done, yeah.
undefined says I'll ping our partners to reply to the email soon!
undefined says Appreciated!
undefined says Could you send me the sender's email address on DM?
undefined says monitoring the sequencer you can see pending tx? the code to do so it's only in GO so far?
undefined says No currently it's private. No one can see it
undefined says so what you can do with the sequencer so far?
undefined says You can subscribe to sequencer feed (by running Arb node) and listen to the sequenced tx, confirmed by sequencer
undefined says ah alright, thanks for the informations

is there somewhere some example code on how to decode the sequencer?
i have seen this link in the docs https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L227
but i have not get how to decode the data
undefined says Run lsblk - which device is /home/xxx mounted?
undefined says Can you check your mount disk is your data disk? Because you might mount to your system disk.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L227 
this code is enought to decode the sequencer right?
undefined says How many third-party verification nodes are there now？
undefined says Arbitrum supports third-party nodes, but does not currently support third-party verification nodes
undefined says I've asked a question about the L2 chain on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/Arbitrum/comments/10smi0r/who_creates_amd_appends_l2_blocks_to_the_nitro/) and @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs  answered (thanks a lot!) and directed me to this channel for follow-up questions.

> Every L2 node creates blocks from incoming messages. It reads those messages from both the L1 Ethereum inbox and the off-chain sequencer feed (if they disagree it favors the L1 Ethereum inbox). Those messages can consist of things like a signed transaction. Nodes will then validate the signature, make sure the source account has enough ether to pay for it, etc. and determine the output state via the state transition function, creating a block in the process.
> 
> Deciding which L2 block to trust without running an L2 full node is tricky if it hasn't been confirmed on L1 yet. This isn't just true for Arbitrum, generally speaking, the best security is from full nodes instead of light clients. It's theoretically possible to build an L2 light client, but I'm not aware of any that exist yet. For now though, you could check reputable sources that run L2 full nodes themselves like Arbiscan, Alchemy, and Infura as a middle ground if you don't want to run an L2 full node yourself.

Does L2 have any Sybil protection mechanism then?  If so, what is the purpose of the L2 chain if it cannot be trusted at all and every node needs to execute the STF locally anyways? Would it not make more sense to just wait for a validator to publish and assert to an RBlock directly instead? Or are there any advantages to the L2 blocks?
undefined says In this link there's information about how to read messages from the Sequencer feed. It describes every data structure available in each message => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says You can find that information in L2Beat (Permissioned addresses / Validators) => https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum
undefined says The L2 nodes just create the blocks locally, they don't broadcast them and they don't need to talk to each other. Unlike other networks, the geth p2p layer is currently unused.
undefined says Alright, makes sense. Thanks!
undefined says Can I ask a question?
undefined says There seems to be an error with the bridge
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x6da21c102bfcfa6023588e88ecc4849437747650942f999d64f9699475f14955
undefined says Looks like you got an "Out of gas" error. Likely due to not providing enough gas to cover the L2 transaction too. But I see you already redeemed it 🙂
undefined says Hi!
We are running a protocol managing 1000s users contracts deployed in ETH mainnet.
Each user needs to trigger a certain transaction every week or month.

We are worried about the total amounts of GAS spent on 1000s transactions

Can we do a sort of manual rollups to batch-process the 1000 transactions?
(I am not sure if this is the right place to ask. plz let me know if it's not!)
undefined says It depends on what opcode each user tx needs use, if each tx you need to call sstore, it will still be expensive if you batch them in a single tx. Arbitrum can be cheap is because we just record the da as calldata, so it can be so cheap.
undefined says 
undefined says Trying to understand the message types (and related methods) https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/libraries/MessageTypes.sol
undefined says If I would like to track transactions related to bridging by users (i.e bridge tokens or bridge messages) and not protocol (for operational needs), would it be sufficient to track just the `L2_MSG` and `L1MessageType_ethDeposit`  events?
undefined says I am confused on whether I should consider the following events as messages (not related to protocol operations, used by users). It seems like we should?

* L1MessageType_L2FundedByL1 = 7;
* L1MessageType_submitRetryableTx = 9;
undefined says I’m treating all of the below messages as messages required by the protocol for operational purposes. These events are not treated as users sending messages between chains (for obvious reasons). 

* L1MessageType_batchPostingReport = 13;
* L2MessageType_unsignedEOATx = 0;
* L2MessageType_unsignedContractTx = 1;
undefined says Yeah...
Each user contract has their balance information data stored.
The transaction updates the balance info.
Then, there might be not much things to improve though we use Arbitrum?
undefined says You also need to track `L1MessageType_submitRetryableTx` because erc20 token will use this way.
undefined says May I ask why you want to track tx by filtering those?
undefined says Yup, gas fee would be much cheaper if you use arbitrum.
undefined says Awesome!
While our user contracts remain in the mainnet,
can we still exploit the Arbiturm's tech to reduce the Gas cost?
undefined says Arbitrum and ethereum do share the same state, you need to redeploy one and recommend your new users to use that.
undefined says Redeploy the contracts on mainnet or arbitrum?
Where can I find any guide/manual for it? 😄
undefined says On arbitrum, arbitrum is evm-compatible, so just do it as what you have done on ethereum would be ok.
undefined says 
undefined says anyone familiar how to deploy contrac with remix ?
undefined says gas fee to deploy contract is around 5$ is that correct?
undefined says You can check how much the gas price is. But 5$ I think should be right.
undefined says thankyou
undefined says Hmm,, what is the core mechanism that makes Arbitrum transaction cheaper?

If my transactions having SSTORE results on Arbitrum will be reflected to ETH mainnet in 7 days, the rollup transaction should use the same SSTORE operation anyway.

How can it reduce the gas cost?... 
I did some search and people say Arbitrum uses CALLDATA instead of SSTORE?
But then... it will not update the EVM states?
undefined says can we find similiar contract on the blockchain?
lets say i make something then i search if this contract is already deployed or not
undefined says Calldata of Arbitrum transactions is stored in L1. But it is first batched (several transactions in the same posted batch) and compressed, which makes that storage operation cheaper. There are other reasons why Arbitrum is able to offer lower fees. I suggest you take a look at this intro ( https://developer.arbitrum.io/intro/#q-okay-so-backing-up-the-optimistic-execution-part-is-how-and-why-arbitrum-is-able-to-offer-low-fees-yes ) and this article that explains how Arbitrum gas fees are calculated ( https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 ). Hope that helps !
undefined says Tricky question. When a contract is deployed, only its bytecode is actually sent to the blockchain, so you would have to search through that to get a match.
There are tools, however, that try to index certain values from the bytecode **and the source code** of a deployed contract to build a search tool. For example, etherscan does that with their "Smart Contract Search Tool", which allows you to query verified contracts using different keys.
At the moment, we don't have any tool like that indexing contracts deployed on Arbitrum (that I'm aware of).
undefined says hmm thank you, so basicly if i edit a few part in the code, it will have different bytecode? but some of them are the same?
undefined says It will depend on the compiler used and its params (e.g. the optimizer). The same contract compiled with different compilers, or different versions, or different parameters might output different results.
undefined says i see, thank you
undefined says Is there a way to decompress a batch in solidity?
undefined says it is taking about half a second to get transactions sent via my node processed. Are there any configuration changes I can make to the node to improve tx response times?
undefined says I am using an alchemy node as the l1.url for the node, is latency to this a factor for tx processing times?
undefined says I would be able to find the ERC20 token transfers through the ERC20Gateway contract events (DepositInitiated on L1 or WithdrawalFinalized on L2). This should allow me to skip `L1MessageType_submitRetryableTx`, right?
undefined says Building a subgraph to track bridge transfers for Eth+tokens and messages.
* Tracking token transfers through relevant gateway contracts.
* Tracking eth deposits and messages thru MessageDelivered events on the Bridge contract.

Filtering the txs so I only track token/eth transfers and non-protocol related bridge messages.
undefined says Hello:)
Trying to parse messages from feed-relay, currently get some errors in `PackInternalTxDataBatchPostingReport` method (`nitro/arbos/util/util.go`), but can't find its implementation, searching doesn't help.
Can anybody provide some advice?
undefined says my friend how can i update i don't know how Arbitrum Nitro v2.0.12 Alpha 1
undefined says Oh, then, are the data stored in L1 on-chain as compressed format?
If so, should I update my Smart contract codes to be able to decompress the data to read?
undefined says Hey! I guess you might be getting error at: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/297577cc49dfcb4085923533f047f4970cbe7104/arbos/util/util.go#L95
Could you provide the exact error you're getting?
undefined says I get `"invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference"`
undefined says Nitro v2.0.11 is the latest version which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub at `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec`
For more info please see here:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.11
undefined says Looking into this :arbiblobblue:
undefined says Just got this exception again, I have this input in `PackInternalTxDataBatchPostingReport(*big.Int, common.Address, uint64, uint64, *big.Int)`. Address is not nil, it's proper address, as I can see, btw.
undefined says Can I use Arbitrum only to cheaply deploy a bunch of smart contracts in ETH mainnet?
undefined says I can wait 7 days 😄 till the states are shared from Arbiturm to ETH mainnet
undefined says Ok you should just get data from node RPC instead of parsing messages from feed-relay
undefined says But this is the only type I can't parse:) Is it known why this error appears?
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs feedback on https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1073227519345565766 would be much appreciated, thanks.
undefined says is it possible to run node from source ie without docker?
undefined says yeah should be
undefined says What is the rollup period?
(the period for rolling up a bunch of transactions and uploading their results from Arbitrum to ETH mainnet?)
undefined says there is a make build command which builds nitro
undefined says i have issue with the nitro.tar:
```err="couln't open init '///home/arbitrum/temp/nitro.tar' archive: open ///home/arbitrum/temp/nitro.tar: no such file or directory"```
i notice you are telling to add the tarball on the docker directory. 
I am running nitro with services, not docker. 
i had no issue with nitro 1.0.9 when i was using the `--init.url="file:///` , no matter where was the nitro.tar.
how can i fix this issue ? can i untar nitro.tar and paste it on my `.arbitrum/arb1/nitro` folder , and avoid the init.url flag ?
undefined says As I mentioned before we strongly recommend getting transactions via the node's RPC and don't provide support for custom uses of the feed.
undefined says I think .5 seconds is actually amazing! Can't think of how you would improve that
undefined says experiencing slippage with such execution times coupled with the sequencer's tx queue which are pending and have not reflected at the univ3 pool's end but guaranteed to before the published tx since they're ahead in the queue.
undefined says the tx is hitting the node very quickly in (in microseconds), can you outline what's happening after that which is causing such a delay? From the docs I know the tx is forwarded to the sequencer and there it orders them via a first-come-first-serve policy, would expect it to be included in a block sooner after that
undefined says I guess you need to download and untar it in the `.arbitrum/arb1/nitro` folder and launch the node with the init flag to construct a correct DB
undefined says Looks like the problem here is not that there's a small delay but that another user is faster than you.  We can't provide support for this.
undefined says noted, I'm just trying to understand the processes happening after the tx is submitted in order to see where the time is being spent at.
undefined says A dispute period is a window of time (currently 7 days) that allows the validators, who are monitoring the state of the Arb, to submit a challenge if they find out the result of the execution that’s posted to L1 is not correct.
undefined says Oh, I see. So, the dispute period is 7 days. How often the data from Arb to Eth are transferred then? Since only after that, we can accept dispute challenges.
undefined says Typically every 30-60 mins the data is posted  to L1
undefined says Can I read my ARB(itrum) contracts data from my L1 contracts 
after the data are posted to L1?
undefined says Yes! This data would be in the form of an L2-L1 message (from  Arbitrum to Ethereum), but it takes 7 days for it to be confirmed
undefined says WOW Awesome! Can I find any guide or tutorial for it?
Since I guess the L1 data posted by Arb is somehow in encrypted OR compressed format?
undefined says How expensive is that Arbitrum L2-L1 message?
Per byte?
undefined says How exactly does a relay node work? Does it need to maintain its own db or does it just act as a proxy forwarding the sequencer feed?
undefined says Is the Arbitrum blockchain already 1.2 TB?
undefined says Whats the difference between a nitro node and an archival node, its not clear?
undefined says Where can I find a list of project that build on arbtrium?
undefined says thanks for your answer. but if i untar the nitro.tar tarball on `.arbitrum/arb1/nitro`, what will be my init flag ?
undefined says i will not give link to http tarball, and neither to file tarball.
undefined says what do i have to add on the init flag ?
undefined says If so, for erc20 side, you just need to track erc20 gateway is ok.
undefined says Sometimes eth will be transferred by createRetryableTicket, you need to track our inbox’s both depositEth and createRetryableTicketXXX function.
undefined says You don’t need to add init.url if you untar it manually.
undefined says By default, the program will try open the db in the dictionary you write, if doesn’t exist one, it will try to read your init url, you can see how we process it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/cmd/nitro/init.go#L176
undefined says I have a node running on achemy but now my VPS is full, now I want to switch to a new VPS, how do I do that?
undefined says come bdb
undefined says Yes, L2 data is batched and compressed and then stored in L1. But you can't decompress it using a smartcontract, because that's a process that happens on L2 at the node level.
What would you be trying to accomplish? I can maybe help you better if I understand your use case.
undefined says You can look at the Dockerfile to see how it is done, although we currently don't support running the node without docker.
undefined says Following up on my previous response. The process I described is how Arbitrum stores all L2 transactions batched and compressed on L1 ( described here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle#3-sequencer-posts-transaction-in-a-batch-on-chain ).
Besides that, as my colleague mentions, you can also send messages from L2 to be executed on L1. This process takes around 7 days and you can see more information on how it works here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging
undefined says Sounds about right, yeah. It is recommended to have a fair amount of extra space if you're planning to run a node, as the current growth rate is around 14Gb per day.
undefined says Ok thanks!
undefined says An archival node is a full (nitro) node that also builds an archive of historical states. Keep in mind that the use cases for having an archival node are rare (for example, if you need to process historical data somehow), and the great majority of users don't need it.
undefined says Got it. So no difference in space?
undefined says Does the chain use a light client at all?
undefined says Yes, you can check our Portal pages:
- Arbitrum One => https://portal.arbitrum.one/
- Arbitrum Nova => https://portal-nova.arbitrum.io/
undefined says You would need more space on an archival node because it also stores historical states of the chain.
undefined says No, only full nodes.
undefined says You will probably have to ask your VPS provider about it.
undefined says 👍
undefined says Appreciate the detailed answer!

We are running a staking protocol managing +1000s users's contracts deployed in ETH mainnet.
After the Capella upgrade, these contracts will receive a few ETHs every 4~5 days. Then, a user may trigger a transaction to retrieve those funds every week or month.

We are worried about the total amounts of GAS spent on 1000s transactions.
undefined says As I understand there is only a single centralised Arbitrum sequencer for now. When is the decentralisation planned for?
undefined says No precise date at this time; opening up the protocol for non-whitelisted validators will come first. Stay tuned
undefined says If I receive L2->L1 message and execute the transaction, 
how would be the GAS cost like for it?
Any benefits (e.g., using CALLDATA instead of SSTORE? Compression?...)
undefined says can i install Arbitrum node or its too late ?
undefined says I understand 🤔 . I can't think of any solution that involves an L2 here. In the case of Arbitrum, the only way for it to communicate with a contract on Ethereum is via L2-to-L1 message, but you won't save any gas with that operation because you'll have to execute the message directly on L1 after the 7-days challenge period ( more info here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging ). 
For your second question, you can see how's the process for an L2-to-L1 message in that link I just copied (essentially, you'll have to send a tx on L2, and execute the message on L1, paying L1 gas).
undefined says You can fin instructions on how to run a node here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says its not too late to install it ?
undefined says What do you mean by "too late"?
undefined says i mean if there is not limit date to install Arb note
undefined says Where can I download the most recent arbitrum fullnode snapshot?
undefined says The init.url in the docs downloads a snapshot from September 2022, it’ll take weeks before my node gets synced
undefined says Hey, I was discussing your issue internally with my colleagues. One possible way of saving gas would be to move your distribution system to L2, that way those transactions would be cheaper. You can can use an oracle that keeps track of the state of your L1 contracts or send L1-to-L2 messages (although you would have to pay L1 gas for this). I don't know the details of your system, but moving parts of it to an L2 could be a good way of saving gas fees.
undefined says AWESOME. This is so helpful!
Since the staking rewards ETHs are sent to L1 contracts, there seems to be no way to avoid the cost for transferring ETHs from those L1 contracts to users wallets.
undefined says Gn. I'm trying to sync archive node but it returns this warns. How to fix it?
undefined says and please add `tag:latest` to the node docker image
undefined says hey Derrenen, this looks like it's related to your L1 RPC endpoint. What are you using to connect to mainnet?
undefined says Will Arbitrum Stylus enable support for the Move smart programming language? The article posted on the Offchain Labs Medium on 7th Feb states that it'll enable C, C++ and Rust support, but I'm wondering if these custom precompiles will enable more languages too?
undefined says self-hosted rpc node
undefined says is it a light node? You'll need a full L1 node
undefined says archive erigon client ofc
undefined says I pass the authentication parameters of the node like this `https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@MYDOMAIN.COM`
undefined says probably the arbitrum node cannot transmit authorization headers?
undefined says the l1 endpoint work fine 100%  cause i'm using it for serving TheGraph
undefined says it's probably that then. Is there another way you can format the auth headers or use a token URI scheme
undefined says nope i've changed a rpc and it doesn't help
undefined says probably smth wrong with my docker-compose?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says sorry for deleting your message there, but it had your username and password exposed on it
undefined says you can anonymize the user/pw/URI here, but what command did you use to run your node? also, can you try adding `--log-level=5` as a param to get more detailed logs and report what you see
undefined says 
undefined says Please how do I run an Arbitrum node. Where do i start ?
undefined says will archive mode have better performance for random state lookups?
undefined says You can download https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar instead. It has a more recent snapshot for full nodes (not archive).
undefined says Here's a good guide on how to set up a node => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says i have arbitrume but i didnt undrstand the last announcement about arbitrume nitro!
undefined says Thanks man!
undefined says Are Uniswap contracts deployed on the Arbitrum Goerli testnet?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says if you find out please lmk brother, im trying to find out too
undefined says 
undefined says How long does it take to sync for an arbitrum node?
undefined says can anyone point me to a doc explaining how arbitrum calculates gas usage per tx?
undefined says It depends on your network status and your disk, usually it will take around 1-2 weeks.
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas
undefined says We have made a pr for this, but it haven’t merged yet: https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/pull/5457
undefined says how would one go about validating that an ERC-20 bridge deployed is safe to use? I'm assuming we can trust the 4 official token lists... but is there any script we can run to confirm the bridges are correctly configured and not backdoored?
undefined says What part do you want to verify? The token list or the bridge code itself? We have bridge code here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts
undefined says given token X on L2, how can I:

- determine its origin token on L1
- confirm the bridge connecting these two is safe/uncompromised

undefined says You can query it here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5288c571Fd7aD117beA99bF60FE0846C4E84F933#readProxyContract, but notice not all of the l1 token bridged to arbitrum by using our contract, we have recorded some of them: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-bridge/blob/master/packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/src/util/WithdrawOnlyUtils.ts
undefined says cant find any relevant info there, e.g. i saw two txs, one would have consumed 140k on mainnet, the other 160k, but on arbi the first was a total of 350k while the second one was 650k, why is that?
undefined says Because you need to pay l1 part fee, you can see how and why here: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says Ok thanks you . I was literally on it but since it wasn’t merged officially and the v3 contract are different from v2 my best options is just to move to goerli eth instead of goerli arbi. But thanks you a lot for your answer

undefined says how to check my nodr if working or not because i have 0 on the dashbord
undefined says I'm trying to post here, but the AutoMod is blocking me 😄
undefined says I'm wondering whether the sequencer would in the future simulate the txs before including them?
undefined says Bot delete if you spam
undefined says It's hard to tell without knowing your architecture, but if you can reduce the number of contracts on L1 (if they are just staking, having fewer contracts manage that), you can have the rewards distribution system on L2. It would cost you gas to reorganise the L1 contracts and deploy needed contracts on L2, but that would be done only once.
In any case, I'm just guessing here. Feel free to DM me if you wanna discuss other possible solutions.
undefined says Do you have any other error messages? Also, is your L1 node fully synced?
undefined says The Sequencer executes the transactions after including them in their inbox, so they can "soft-confirm" them => https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle#2-sequencer-orders-transaction-off-chain
undefined says ah, got it thanks
undefined says Can someone please help me ? I run an arbitrum node but I think I used the wrong docker command in my service
undefined says I can't find the database data and am scared to restart the node
undefined says > sudo /usr/bin/docker run --network host --rm -i -v /root/.arbitrum:/root/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://127.0.0.1:8545
undefined says there is nothing in /root/.arbitrum
undefined says how to check where the db is stored ? The node is fully synced
undefined says How long did it take to fully sync?
undefined says 2~3 days
undefined says Snapshot is old af
undefined says AWESOME!! I will DM you! 😄
undefined says enjoy your work
undefined says Thanks for the support 🙂
undefined says it looks like your L1 node is not returning any log data (getting an empty array), so it is probably not a full node. You need a full L1 node (not a light one)
undefined says :arbitrum:
undefined says Does anyone have a node that has stopped confirming transactions?
undefined says 
undefined says looks your log is good, why you think it stopped?
undefined says yes,L1 node is fully synced, I'm running a node as a block validator but the validation stopped with the message "accumulator not found".could you help me with this issue.
undefined says I think this was an error that was fixed in the latest version of the node, v2.0.11
undefined says Thanks a lot, I will try the latest version.
undefined says It no longer responds on my alchemy, sir
undefined says Could you provide more details? Like what calls you send and no response from alchemy, is it l1 rpc call?
undefined says request descends and it last worked 3 hours ago, sir
undefined says Once your node sync to latest state, it won’t need to read l1 as frequently as syncing, your node will subscribe to feed url and get the latest sequenced tx information.
undefined says Ohh Thanks sir :arbiflame:
undefined says ·
undefined says There are a couple of things that might be happening:
- You're missing the --l2.chain-id parameter
- The first part of the -v argument ( `-v /root/.arbitrum:/root/.arbitrum` ) must exist on your local filesystem. As you're running with sudo, it probably has been created with root privileges, but make sure it is there and docker can write to it.
- The second part of the -v argument ( `-v /root/.arbitrum:/root/.arbitrum` ) should be `/home/user/.arbitrum` .
undefined says Thx for taking the time to answer.
The L2 chain parameter is here. My copy/paste didn't work properly :
"ExecStart=sudo /usr/bin/docker run --network host --rm -i -v /root/.arbitrum:/root/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://127.0.0.1:8545  --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*"
The first par of the argument /root/.arbitrum was created beforehand with root user. How to make sure docker can write to it ?
If the second part of the argument is wrong, is there any way I can update it without having to sync again all the way ?
undefined says It's still not resolved after upgrading to v2.0.11
undefined says 
undefined says parameters are here: "/usr/local/bin/nitro --l1.url=https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --node.block-validator.enable --node.block-validator.current-module-root=latest"
undefined says You can try and sh into the container, and then copy the database to the correct mount point
undefined says Can you help me how to ?
undefined says That operation is specific to docker, so the support I can give you is limited. But you can find more information on how to run commands in a running container, or how to get a shell there, in their documentation => https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/
undefined says Will look into this, thank you bro
undefined says After finishing the configuration, how many hours does it take to sync?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  is there a way to prune the node ? The chain directory is 600 GB now . I tried restarting the docker but it doesn't really prune data .
Also the flags `--core.checkpoint-prune-on-startup --core.database.compact --core.database.exit-after` doesn't exist.

Can you help ?
undefined says It will take 30min to an hour depending on your hardware
undefined says We don't support manual pruning at the moment, but it will be added in the near future!
undefined says From scratch ?
Mine took 2~3 days. Is there any recent snapshot you use to sync in 1 hour ?
undefined says You're right actually. Users usually report it takes up to 3-4 days for them (again, depending on the hardware)

also, cc @! kmZ
undefined says Any way to create our own snapshot ?
undefined says Just checking, do reorgs exist on arbitrum?
undefined says Can’t see any info on arbiscan
undefined says I'm looking for a off-chain arbitrum gas price api. do you guys have one?
undefined says ok finally, I got a message to send lol
undefined says (I tried to reference the ones that other networks provide but your bot blocked my links obvs)
undefined says I've searched the chat, and it seems like the answer is no?
undefined says You should be able to get the base fee from any standard RPC API
undefined says They're theoretically possible but we try to avoid them, and we've been successfully avoiding them for quite a while now 🙂
undefined says yep, I was hoping for something like the etherscan gas price api to plug into this thing I'm workin on, but that's ok. thanks
undefined says can i dm
undefined says Sure, send me a friend request
undefined says im unable to it says youre not accepting
undefined says think you need to reques tme
undefined says I think Arbiscan supports these same functions: https://docs.arbiscan.io/api-endpoints/geth-parity-proxy#eth_gasprice (Arbiscan is run by Etherscan)
undefined says thank you 🙏 found this working on how to use it
undefined says what hard ur using?
undefined says does arbitrum have different gas costs than mainnet? I noticed the absolute number for gas is much higher than. mainnet, even though the $ value of the fee is lower
undefined says it is normal to have 0 CONC. REQUESTS
undefined says 
undefined says Arb One is cheaper than mainnet. What were you looking at referring to that absolute number being higher?
undefined says is there support for nitro node syncers in this channel?
undefined says trying to sync a nitro node using the docker image, with a mounted 1.5TB EBS volume, which has been mounted in the container run command (as per the nitro/arb docs). but the snapshot download is failing with :
```
attempt 1 failed: write /tmp/nitro.tar: no space left on device
```
so it must be trying to save temp files within the container file system itself (not in the mounted volume), just wondering if there are additional args that need to be passed to handle this?
undefined says FYI resolved by creating a /data/tmp dir (on the EBS volume) and mounting it as a volume in docker run with: `-v /data/tmp:/tmp`  - so nitro will use it for the tmp dowload dir instead of within the container fs
undefined says !!
undefined says I want to build an arbitrum full node. If I use 8g of memory and 4-core CPU, how long will it take to synchronize? Does anyone know how big the historical data of arbitrum is at present
undefined says Usually within one week, it also depends on your disk latency, and network status.
undefined says How big is the current block data, more than 1T？
undefined says 
undefined says WHY
undefined says You need prepare more than 1.4 t ssd to run it.
undefined says The reason of the error is a corrupted snapshot that I used
undefined says i've downloaded a new one and resync the node so now it works fine
undefined says Can we build a light node similar to Ethereum
undefined says We don’t provide light node mode
undefined says thanks
undefined says I have a question: how can I estimate the L1 gas fee on Arbitrum programmatically?

I checked the doc here https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing, but it's so confused and I don't know where to start.

Is there any Arbitrum contract that I can use to get the baseFee on L1?

For example, on Optimism, there is this contract 0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F that I can use to query the L1 base fee and also there is a concrete logic in Solidity so I can use in my Golang code to simulate the fee calculator
undefined says Here's another article that explains how gas works on Arbitrum => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

To estimate the different gas components, you can use our "NodeInterface" => https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas#nodeinterfacesol

Methods `gasEstimateComponents` and `gasEstimateL1Component` (you can see the code here => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol )

Hope that helps !
undefined says Hi @José FP | Offchain Labs 
Not sure if I understand correctly, but it's an empty function (no implementation)
undefined says I mean gasEstimateComponents and gasEstimateL1Component in Solidity
undefined says are there snapshots for the nitro node which are closer to the L2 head? ~block 60M
undefined says Looking for a  developer to  work with . I'm a character artist with 10 experience for well known  studios and my colleague a 3D modeler with 15 expierince for well known studios and his work was feautured in hollywoow movies .  We're thinking about launching our collection.
undefined says which URL did you use? the latest snapshot is https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says Hey Tijan, we don't coordinate those kind of things here, but you might want to join ETHGlobal and participate in one of their live or virtual hackathons: https://ethglobal.com/events . They have a Discord where you can pair up with potential teammates
undefined says In your Go script you can call the NodeInterface (on address 0xc8) through an RPC, and use those methods (as mentioned here => https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas#nodeinterfacesol )

If that's not what you need, can you give some more information about what you're trying to accomplish, so I can better understand your issue?
undefined says whats the best way to get the historical price of a token given the timestamp it was bought on? I'm guessing something on the graph?
undefined says possibly the graph, against Uniswap, if you pass a particular block number to the query. You might also check something like the CoinGecko API
undefined says thats exactly what i was thinking as well, using the uniswap graph. I know etherscan pro has historical coin price info and whatnot, wasn't sure if arbiscan supported that.. even though i wouldn't sign up for pro probably still 😂
undefined says appreciate it
undefined says What are the operating hours of this discord? @Matt | Offchain Labs @Luke | Arbitrum
undefined says please do not ping random team members. we try to check these developer channels every few hours during weekdays to answer any questions that come up. For non-dev questions, please ask in #📬︱support
undefined says I am running a local nitro node using the guide found here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node. But its unclear to me what kind of node I am running. Is it an archive node or a full node that just keeps the last 128 or so blocks?
undefined says The default command is just a fullnode keep 128 blocks, if you want to run archive node, you can add `--node.caching.archive`
undefined says I see. Do you know roughly how much space is needed for an archive node?
undefined says Around 2 TB now.
undefined says And with the expected growth rate of 14GB per day
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs bro I want to create smart contract adress can I?
undefined says Do this
undefined says thanks, I got it. Will try and come back if I can not send the message to RPC node
undefined says You mean specific an address? You can’t make this, the address of contract is decided by your sender address and nonce.
undefined says I tried to send this to the RPC node but it does not work

```curl -sSL 'https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc' -XPOST \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ --data '{"method":"gasEstimateL1Component","params":["0xc8", false, "<"my raw tx here>"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' | jq```

Got this response:
```{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "the method gasEstimateL1Component does not exist/is not available"
  }
}
```
undefined says what did I miss here?
undefined says 3 params of the function are: 
- address to,
- bool contractCreation,
- bytes calldata data

so I sent `"params":["0xc8", false, "<"my raw tx here>"]`
undefined says can you please share a working example?
undefined says Please help me
undefined says how to generate solgen/go/precompilesgen/precompilesgen.go
undefined says 
undefined says I encountered error like could not fined solgen/go/precompilesgen/precompilesgen.go when I installed the arbos package
undefined says help me
undefined says actually, calling RPC directly to get the estimated gas for a tx is not what I want to achieve, because calling the RPC on the fly is not good for API latency

Instead, I want to "simulate" the gas calculation (in the backend I will store the L1 base fee and some other things). When a request comes in, I can get the tx call data and then "simulate" the gas calculation by "apply" a "formula" using the L1 base fee + tx call data

So actually, what I need is the way to get the L1 base fee for Arbitrum + the formula to calculate the gas
undefined says I found this contract https://arbiscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006c#readContract that has the function `getL1GasPriceEstimate` that might be what I need

But at the moment, the value returned from `getL1GasPriceEstimate` is around 18 Gwei, while on etherscan gas tracker, the gas price is around 28 Gwei. I'm not sure if this is the correct one?
undefined says Please help me
undefined says I have just set up the local node
undefined says I am going to run the bot on it
undefined says And then I run the feed relay as an event listener
undefined says So I got message from sequencer feed like this
undefined says 
undefined says and I was going to parse the parseL2Transaction to get the transaction info
undefined says please help me
undefined says Urgently
undefined says I've had a few tx's sending ETH where the amount of gas used has varied unlike on mainnet where it's fixed to 21,000. Why is that?
undefined says Hey, let me try to answer all your questions:

- You can find the formula to calculate the gas here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

- And here you have an example in TS on how to query the NodeInterface if you wish to do so => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg/scripts/normalTx.js#L35-L49

- About the ArbGasInfo precompile, getL1BaseFeeEstimate() will give you an estimate of the L1 base fee you will pay as part of your L2 transaction fees. This takes into account the batching and compression of your data that happens in Arbitrum. For a better estimation, you can use ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei(), which will give you all gas data you need. For the L1 part, you have the second value returned which will give you the fees to be paid for each byte of data of your transaction => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L34-L44 . Hope this helps you.
undefined says Hey, you can find info on how to read the messages from the Sequencer here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says I knew
undefined says I know
undefined says I have to use parseL2Transaction function but to use the parseL2Transaction, I have to install go packages
undefined says There isn't a fixed amount of gas that is paid in each transaction, because part of the fees paid depend on the L1 gas price. This article explains how fees are calculated in Arbitrum, and can help you understand that => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says I'm not sure I understand what you want to accomplish. Can you specify a little bit more what you're trying to do?
The parseL2Transactions function linked in that page shows you how it is done in Go, but you can write a code that does the same in the language you're using.
undefined says To use the parseL2Transaction, I have to install packages
undefined says have you ever installed github/nitro/arbos package?
undefined says It depends on what you are doing, but you can always write the message parsing function in the language you are using. Can you specify a bit more what you are trying to accomplish?
undefined says Currently, I got message from the sequencer feed like this
undefined says So I could get the l2Msg from this
undefined says And then I have to parse the l2Msg to get transaction info such as sender address. to and so on
undefined says So I have to use the parseL2Msg
undefined says But on package installation, I have this error like this
undefined says I haven't found out the github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/precompilesgen

undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs  @tsahi @davidb | Offchain Labs  hey!
undefined says it seems some contracts calls are failing out of gas today
undefined says specially like the last 5 hours
undefined says never happened tho
undefined says is this something on arbitrum?
undefined says Did arbitrum nitro have any parameters to increase batch  worker speed?
I am just send to node batch with 128 requests with debug_traceBlockByNumber and get answer after 8-10 sec, but server load average too small
undefined says did something changed at all in aribtrum in the last hours
undefined says Please, do not tag random team members. We monitor this channel every now and then, don't need to tag us. I'll address your question soon.
undefined says is there any problem with gas limit estimation
undefined says sorry but its kinda urgent lol
undefined says We haven't made any changes recently. How are you estimating your gas fees? Can you send a txn hash to take a look at the error too? (You can DM me if you prefer)
undefined says Thanks for the answer
undefined says So we are using ethers and it was failing with its prediction
undefined says So we started manually setting a super high gas limit using forge but the transaction fails after using much less gas that we set
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x51690e0eb8bbda2ab7352c9989713eafb1bbdf4d1bbd6b93d81c0710f05e305b
undefined says Alright, let me take a closer look at this and I'll get back to you
undefined says sure ty
undefined says Do you have the source code of the contract https://arbiscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006c#readContract ?
I want to read it so that I can understand it

Thank you very much
undefined says Looking at your transaction, it looks like it's using more gas than it can fit in a block. The block gas limit is 32M and your transaction fails when it reaches that limit. I see the same happened in the previous calls to zaptoglpEth.
undefined says Yes, here it is => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.go
If you want to take a look at the code of other precompiles, you have the list in this page => https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/precompiles
undefined says any guess why its suddenly higher? it used to be like 28mi before, nothing changed
undefined says Oh, I thought that it is written in Solidity

So all the contracts in Nitro are written in Golang? Just the interface files are in Solidity?
undefined says Gas used by a transaction is correlated to the function's logic, so you'll have to take a look at what the code is doing that's causing such a high gas usage.
undefined says ArbGasInfo is a precompile, It's code that lives in specific predetermined addresses and provide functionality/tools needed for our protocol. You can read more about them here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/#precompiles

The rest of the contracts are written in Solidity and behave like the ones deployed on mainnet.
undefined says Is this a hard limit? Or is it dynamic
undefined says hard limit
undefined says Node pruning would be a great upgrade.  We've got a handful of nodes running, and over time the data directory keeps growing, but if we wipe/resync, it drops considerably.  Over the course of a month it normally grows to ~500gb, then after wipe/resync its back in the ~150gb range.  Would be great to have an option to prune/clean locally (even if its just a manual process of bringing the node down, running a pruner, brining it back up), rather than having to re-sync every few weeks.
undefined says I got forwarded by your colleague over in #📬︱support to ask my question here, so potentially theres someone able to help me.

My initial support request was regards an corrupted wallet/seed phrase earlier. I somehow catched malware, that potentially caught my seed phrase when trasnferring metamask from brave to chrome (Hard to really verify at this point tbh, but machine discovered malicious app when i checked, which is resolved and consumed as salty learning lesson.)
I've been using that hot wallet for basically almost 2 years for all kinds of stuff, especially for early participation in new L2's and other EVM chains.

With the last airdrop from blur on mainnet i realized that i will have likely returning episodes of PTSD whenever i would have been eliglible for future airdrops of any kind....
Which would honestly take much fun out of playing around with early stage networks, like i did when arbitrum launched.

Is there any possible way we can find, to remove the old wallet from any potential snapshots/lists/records regarding your governance token distribution and maybe even transfer the eligibility to a wallet i have secured access to?
(Im still having access to the old one, so i f.e. could sign a tx to prove this ownership on both public keys?)
undefined says Hey, it'll be added very soon!
undefined says Hey, I'm sorry and I don't think there's any way
undefined says really appreciate it!
undefined says That'd be quite depressing ngl, since it will gonna keep punishing me :yikesspin: 

Is there a way you can check back in with the team or something to see if there might be a way? :x 
I mean theres at least the point to make that it would be definitely of advantage to the general to not let this run unchallenged since some hacker dumping his loot doesnt give anyone anything VS someone who actually used the protocol for almost 2 years mainly with 1k transactions :coping:
undefined says there is no way for us to do that, sorry
undefined says can i set maxpeers on arbitrum full node? works like bsc? --maxpeers ?
undefined says Arbitrum nodes don't work like that. They don't need peers, they just need access to a single L1 node and the feed from the sequencer
undefined says Does any one know if Arbitrum provides RPC interface to check the transaction/block finality state?
undefined says In other words, how can I check if the transaction/block is in "hard finality" or not?
undefined says We also support safe/finality tags in rpc, also you can call our precompile to check, here is the example: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/l1-confirmation-checker
undefined says Is there an official Arbitrum Nitro (testnet) version of USDC? If yes can anyone point me to the faucet
undefined says I don't think there's a faucet for USDC on our testnet, but you can use a faucet on Ethereum Goerli and use our bridge to deposit it on Arbitrum Goerli => https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Thanks @José FP | Offchain Labs for the prompt reply!

undefined says Build node synchronization slow, have a good snapshot？
undefined says The price of gas also increased and the same thing
undefined says Does any one know how to use java to finish transfer eth from Eherum to arbitrun ? Just like this one https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/eth-deposit
undefined says please any tuto for last update node arbitrum
undefined says This is node testnet or mainet sir??
undefined says Can anyone run a validator node?
not sure what you mean by: `Currently, the ability to post assertions on-chain for mainnet Arbitrum chains is whitelisted.`
undefined says What's the difference between an Rblock and a L2 block?
undefined says I think you can run a validator only in watchtower mode rn. https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#running-a-validator
undefined says That's where i took my quote from
undefined says i have a problem with chain id why when i put the number of chain id in metamask i get error !
undefined says If I want run my own arbi node, do I have to have a L1 node in the first place?
undefined says you can use a third-party node
undefined says if you arent in whitelist, you cant post assertion on eth
undefined says But I should still able to send arbi transaction through my arbi node right?
undefined says maybe you should sync your node first, i am not sure
undefined says 
undefined says Anyone know what this error is about?

undefined says Does Bitquery have access to Arb API? Can't find any info.
undefined says why does it say  P2P server will be useless, neither dialing nor listening on the logs
undefined says Getting Failed writing batch to db error
undefined says Can someone point me to the right pages for protocol bridging?
undefined says Are these eth_sendRawTransaction calls? Failing sendRawTransaction calls are rate limited
undefined says We don’t use p2p mode on arbitrum network, nodes no need to connect to each others since they just needs to forward tx to sequencer and listen on sequencer’s updates.
undefined says Oh ok, thought it might be related to the error Im getting:

undefined says How did you shutdown your node last time?
undefined says this is the first time I ran the docker command to start node
undefined says I did get Error reading unclean shutdown markers with error="leveldb: not found"
undefined says does it matter if I changed the ports here? -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548
undefined says You can change your host’s port here.
undefined says What is the ram of your node, seems your db closed unexpected.
undefined says 128 GB DDR4 ECC
undefined says Do i have to create this folder? /home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says You don’t need to, but you should make sure your host’s mount point dictionary exists.
undefined says Looking into this
undefined says Hey, Nitro (and go-ethereum) can take infinite amount of RAM depending on request load, could you check your system log see if there is OOM?
undefined says Actually I switched the ports up to the default and it seems to be syncing now
undefined says Arbitrum has 3 types of validator, you can see them here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#validators, currently users can only run watchover mode if they are not in whitelist.
undefined says You can try use web3j: https://github.com/web3j/web3j
undefined says is there a more recent snapshot tho? looks like its syncing from september last year
undefined says thats gonna take ages
undefined says I use --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says ty
undefined says You should download it first and untar it to your mount dictionary.
undefined says it wont work if I put it into  --init.url= ?
undefined says Someone said this will throw errors if you don’t use genesis snapshot so you should do it as what I said would be better.
undefined says it should work now but that tar is huge so its recommended to download it separately and serve using file://
undefined says any privacy projects on arbitrum?
undefined says running a node with "./test-node.bash --init --dev"
gives an error validator address is not whitelisted
undefined says is there way to solve it ?
undefined says arbiscan on maintenance, for how long?
undefined says Yes I also have this issue
undefined says Were you able to solve your issue?
undefined says Our most recent snapshot is in https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar . It is recommended that you download it first and then pass it as file://
Also, take into account the minimum hardware requirements as stated here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says An L2 block is a block of transactions produced by Arbitrum's validator nodes (analogous to L1 blocks).
An RBlock is a "rollup block", that contains an assertion of the current state root of the Arbitrum's chain. These RBlocks are also produced by validators but are added to the L1 chain. You can see how it works here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-rollup-chain
undefined says If you're using the right chain id ( https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains ), it might be a Metamask related error. However, check if you're already using the same chain id in another network, or remove it and add it again.
undefined says Yes, to sync to the latest chain state, Arbitrum nodes read the transactions that have been executed from the batches that are posted on L1. They then connect to the Sequencer feed to get the transactions that have not yet been posted on L1.
You can have your own L1 node, or use a third party node provider.
undefined says You can find information on how to bridge assets here => https://developer.offchainlabs.com/asset-bridging
undefined says I'm not sure what your exact needs are, but our Portal is a good source for projects in the ecosystem => https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says You don't need the "--dev" option for running the local node. 
Also, keep in mind that this is a local node, used to emulate an L1 and L2 network on your machine, mostly for development.
undefined says I run my own node, but it's sync so slow.
undefined says any idea to catching up ?
undefined says wen ido?
undefined says Can a L2 -> L1 batch fail? Making the transactions in jt fail?
undefined says So a reorg on L1 or gas spike could in theory make the batch fail
undefined says Would the transactions in it revert to failed?
undefined says L1 reorg or gas spike will only delay the batch to be posted
undefined says there is no such thing as a batch failed causing transaction to be reverted
undefined says So absolutely no way a TX can revert from succesfull?
undefined says great
undefined says there is certain way (although very rare if the sequencer is behaving properly) that transaction with soft confirmation from sequencer might not actually be included, I suggest you to read this page https://developer.offchainlabs.com/tx-lifecycle
undefined says from what i read there, if i understand correctly, if i'm running my own sequencer, an honest one, my TXs will always go through
undefined says or are you not refering to the `malicious/faulty` sequencer section
undefined says You cannot run a sequencer (not right now) as that is whitelisted and ran by OffchainLabs (us)
undefined says we would get in touch for that... hopefully you would accept xD
undefined says what do you mean
undefined says Oh ran by you
undefined says i stopped reading on the whitelisted part
undefined says not me personally but the company haha
undefined says 😅
undefined says yeah yeah
undefined says but anyways, eventually we would have a node
undefined says so, if you want greater certainty, you should look for your transaction being confirmed in a L1 batch
undefined says that takes around 3-5 mins?
undefined says its too long
undefined says yes and you can query these function with your node (or any Arbitrum node you trust) https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/8e786ec6d1ac3862be85e0c9b5ac79cbd883791c/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L53-L71
undefined says in 3-5 mins the asset could've had 3-5 owners xD
undefined says so assuming i'm using a trustworthy node to submit the transactions, is there a scenario where it can fail?
undefined says what do you mean by fail, your transaction can revert for various reason
undefined says So assuming the trustworthy sequencer processes the transaction, publishes it on a L2 block and returns a successful L2 TX like:
undefined says can it revert from here?
undefined says Does anyone in here know how I can calculate programmitacally buy taxes and sell taxes of a token?
undefined says Who would be the best to talk to about Stylus?
undefined says No, it can't revert
undefined says You can ask here any questions you may have
undefined says Do you have specs docs? 
What kinds of WASM can be run? 
Can it be run as a sidechain? 
Are you looking for partners?
How do you verify the WASM outputs?
Are you working on a WASM zk vm? 
Do you allow for external data access?
undefined says I have plenty more but thats a start
undefined says The only information that is available right now is the one that you can find in the official articles written about Stylus:
- https://offchain.medium.com/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22
- https://thedefiant.io/aribitrum-new-computing-language

Two things about your questions that I can answer though:
- We are not actively looking for partners, but if you have a good proposal, you can drop an e-mail to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
- If you're interested, at the end of the first article I just linked, you have a form to sign up to be among the first to try Stylus when we upgrade our testnet
undefined says I'm trying to get new pairs created on arbitrum, does anyone have the Uniswap factory contract for arbitrum?
undefined says Thanks for the explanation, so I read that there is an L1 contract that tracks with "The Assertion Tree" all these Rblock posted by Arbitrum's validators on L1 chain. If I understood correctly this is the trick that make possible "binding" the L2 chain to L1, inheriting security and trustlessly finality.
undefined says Validators make their assertion (Rblocks) only on the L2 transactions included in the batches posted by the sequencer?
undefined says A sequencer can posts Rblocks? What's inside a batch posted by the sequencer?
undefined says Why a person should choose to be a validator?
undefined says I'm running a local dev node and in the stdout i get messages from nitro-sequencer-1 but also from nitro-poster-1 and nitro-stacker-unsafe-1. What are these last 2 components and what is their role in the system?
undefined says anyone running a nitro node on windows? (without docker or virtualization)
undefined says You can find those uniswap deployment address list here: https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments
undefined says The assertion and batch posted are 2 different part, sequencer will send the batch first, and it contains the transactions’ DA, then validator will read those DA and make an assertion on their state. Sequencer only post batches, they don’t produce rblock. And staker is the validator who already staked on chain.
undefined says Correct, this can let l1 bridge know what the l2 state is and can release those l2-to-l1 tx.
undefined says If one of the transaction is fraud, how the arbitrum revert the next correlated transactions?
undefined says If tx is invalid (wrong nonce/signature etc), network will reject it directly, if there is some logic or execution error, network will revert it during the tx just like others evm chains. But if validator stake on a wrong state, it won’t affect the your state if you connect to an honest rpc node, this is because all fullnode will run their own and compute the right state, and they can base on l1’s da to execute, they don’t need to read validator’s state. This means once your tx recorded on l1, your state will be confirmed because l1 already record your tx’s sequence and input, those 2 things are the key to determine your state.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsIf an L2 transaction is nonce or a signature error, the network will directly reject it. If an L2 transaction has been successfully posted to L1 for execution by the sequencer, and the execution error or fraud declaration time is successfully appealed, the status of the transaction on L1 will fail, and L2 will also synchronize the execution status of the transaction, right？
undefined says thanks for the reply
undefined says L1 just recorded t l2’s da and state, the da includes tx’s sequence and input, we know evm is single-threading, which means if we know those tx’s sequence and their input, we can execute those tx’s unique state. So fraud proof will not change this unique state, it will just change the wrong state recorded on l1 to the unique right state.
undefined says Yep. Our sequencer RPC has a limit on how many failing transactions it'll accept per unit time from an IP so it can't be DoS'd. I'd recommend making sure that your transactions have the correct nonce, a high enough gas price cap, and enough balance before sending them. Alternatively, you could submit your txs via L1, but keep in mind that they'd be delayed and you'd still have to pay for posting any failed txs to L1.
undefined says ` So fraud proof will not change this unique state, it will just change the wrong state recorded on l1 to the unique right state. ` In other words, the transaction status on l2 was actually confirmed when it was submitted to the inbox. Then, if the appeal is successful within the fraud declaration time, it will only roll back the transaction status on l1 and will not affect the transaction status on l2.
undefined says Exactly -- all L2 nodes immediately know the result of the tx. The fraud proofs are just about proving that known result to L1.
undefined says That is: the fraud proved to be a ruling on the rollup block. During the synchronization of the rollup block to the main network, if no one challenges the block within a week, the block can be considered valid. Is that all right?
undefined says Yep, but all L2 nodes immediately know which blocks are valid by executing the state transition function, without needing to wait for the L1 rollup's arbitration.
undefined says I see. Thank you very much for your answer.
undefined says Thank you so much
undefined says Anyone know what is the role of nitro-poster and nitro-staker-unsafe within the protocol?
undefined says Thank you ser, I know about this but it just appears Uniswap V3 factory ca for arbitrum and it is not the factory that emits created pairs events. So I don't know which factory emits them as there are no more factory ca on arbitrum in this documentation
undefined says nitro-poster is batch-poster client, nitro-staker-unsafe means node run without validator, we have config file here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/testnode-scripts/config.ts#L236
undefined says You’d better ask this on uniswap’s discord.
undefined says 
undefined says How to traverse transactions in historical blocks
undefined says I use client.BlockByNumber(context.Background(), blockNum) but it's not work
undefined says Reason: Duplicated text
undefined says Put this in your `go.mod` file:
```
replace github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum => github.com/offchainlabs/go-ethereum v0.0.0-20230214000259-f5dfc42653fc

undefined says stock geth can't parse the arbitrum tx types so you'll need to use our geth if you want to use the `BlockByNumber` method
undefined says I want to connect to the Sequencer to both subscribe to the sequencer's feed of transactions, and send transactions to the Sequencer.
I know the feed WS is provided as: X
When trying to connect to this WebSocket I get HTTP response 400 of Bad Request, do I need to provide additional data in the path or query string to this URL?
undefined says Removed the feed address as my message was flagged by the bot.
undefined says You can't send txs through the feed, you should use a local node to get incoming transactions and then send transactions to `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc`
undefined says Thank you, is it possible to subscribe to the mempool equivalent of the sequencer?
I want to profile the frequency and order transactions are submitted, like we currently can do by monitoring the mempool in Ethereum.

Just looking at the blocks does not provide any intrablock timing of when transactions were submitted to the sequencer.
undefined says Nope, the sequencer's incoming transactions are kept private until they're put in a block to prevent frontrunning
undefined says hi!
Can somebody help me?
I have a working arbitrum-one-mainnet node.
I created an AMI from it several days ago. But when I want (today) to launch instance from this AMI - the instance rises, but the arbitrum service stucks and it can take sooooo long. 
Restarting the service doesn't help. What the problem is? I no have any ideas.
Thanks in advance!
undefined says I see, the documentation seems to say that the sequencer has the final say over the order of transactions, so once the sequencer has seen a transaction, it is not possible to front run them.

Is this not the case, and it is possible to send a transaction AFTER a transaction the sequencer has been seen, and have it be sequenced before the prior transaction?
undefined says 
undefined says When I install the node I can't open the network??
undefined says Something that is really confusing me

As a protocol owner

If I want to move liquidity of an ERC20 to arbitrum
I can bridge using official bridge
And it has the same token address as mainnnet

I do not need to issue a new contract correct?
undefined says A new token contract is automatically created on L2 by default, but it doesn't have the same address
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/asset-bridging
undefined says Perfect - thanks soo much Lee - I see this now - this 
https://etherscan.io/address/0x21413c119b0c11c5d96ae1bd328917bc5c8ed67e
maps to this

undefined says How can I subscribe to Arbitrum mempool?
undefined says Arbitrum doesn’t have mempool, it is first in first serve model.
undefined says ？
undefined says This is not mempool like l1, it’s just a fifs queue, and can’t be subscribed.
undefined says 
undefined says how to sign
undefined says do  u  use  what
undefined says What is this, please don’t sign message to the entity you don’t know . Sign message usually can be done with your wallet.
undefined says Please tell me how it can be that there is only outgoing 1 tx of eth from the wallet. And how he materialized there is no trace. And the second. The outgoing transaction has no fee paid, why?

undefined says we have our own arbitrum node, but we have a  "Public RPC Rate Limit Hit ". how ca we increase limit on our own nodes ?
undefined says I am running an Arb node using the standard docker image on Docker for Windows.
Sometimes when performing a write operation, the docker image will freeze and become unresponsive, and the container has to be killed.
Here it started to write the Trie cache to disk, and never came back (about 4 hours since this log message).
Has anyone else experienced this issue?
Docker shows only 1.7GB consumed by the container, consuming now zero CPU, so it's hung.
undefined says NICE
undefined says anyone know approx storage size used by a fresh non-archive node?
undefined says why do i keep getting ``broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429``
undefined says when trying to run a relay
undefined says 429 is a rate limit error. some 3rd party connection is being queried too frequently
undefined says try another service instead if possible, or reduce rate limit
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says how to sign it
undefined says The tools you provide are not working anymore
undefined says im running a relay, i used the feed url in arbitrum website
undefined says This is a deposit tx (from l1), you can see it here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0d079a1549d2489b44b47113e8292c40453a80f9#deposittxs, and that address is that number is because we alias it: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
undefined says This is due to our sequencer rpc limit, Lee has explained this: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1077456828499251240
undefined says What is your disk, is it NVMe?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration
undefined says Try click connect to Web3 button.
undefined says We have added rate limit to our feed url, you should only use that to run your node.
undefined says it ｏｋ　ｎｏｗ
undefined says rip
undefined says all my competitors are fine though, so its only rate limited to new connections init?
undefined says you guys also made is 10x harder to run on OVH since yesterday, why?
undefined says noticed gas was acting a bit strange over the past hour - some users encountered $10 gas prices (450k gas units) to close a position.

assume you guys are aware, but what was the reason for this spike? noticed L1 gas at 40-50 gwei during this period
undefined says (possibly an issue with metamask gas estimation?)
undefined says Yeah something was going on with the blocks of late
undefined says Like spam attacks or something like that, maybe there was a big token sale
undefined says Anyone else having trouble using Arbitrum Goerli right now?
undefined says what issues are you running into?
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs just having some errors related to gas estimation, I think it's normal.
undefined says I'm trying to use gas prices from owlricle, but my gas limits were too low
undefined says thanks for responding!
undefined says I've been trading on my own node for 4 months without any problems, but for the last few days I've been getting a "nonce too low" warning in the logs. My transactions are waiting in que. It seems to be approved on arbiscan, but I am getting a warning in the docker logs and the processes are pending in the metamask. How do I solve this problem?
undefined says are you submitting multiple transactions at a time?
undefined says Seeing this error occasionally when sending a txn: "max fee per gas less than block base fee: address 0x..., maxFeePerGas: 300000000 baseFee: 1486130000". but from looking at the chain, I don't think thats actually the required gas?  Bumping the limit isn't always an option, since if I bump it enough to cover cases like this, the txn gets rejected with not enough balance to cover the (potential, but wrong) max gas cost.
undefined says guys are there any grants for developers or funding for the project to build on Arbitrum?
undefined says I think this is a metamask issue, try resetting the account data (that option is hidden away somewhere in the advanced menu). I don't think it clears your seeds/private keys, but back them up just in case.
undefined says Nope. I realized there was a problem and I traded for testing at different time intervals.
undefined says It's probably a metamask-related problem, but seeing the "nonce too low" warning in the docker logs made me uneasy. I reset metamask. Now I restarted docker as well. After the sync is finished, I will look at the result and write again.
undefined says there's no grant programs currently; if you're building something on Arb and want cross-promotional opportunities, please reach out to `partnerships@offchainlabs.com`
undefined says it may have been a momentary base fee spike
undefined says Is that a thing that happens on arbitrum?  I don't think I've ever seen a transaction that wasn't locked at the 0.1gwei mark?
undefined says the 0.1 fee will increase if ArbOne exceeds 7M gas per second, so yes, our base fee can increase from time to time based on congestion. It has traditionally been rare, but, for example, yesterday was a record day in terms of transactions processed, so I believe we did see some spikes then
undefined says Well good to know.  Thanks for clearing that up 🙂
undefined says What do you mean 10x harder?
undefined says I have some questions
1. I'm running arbitrum goerli node with nitro v2.0.10. However my nitro node uses only 24GB space. Is it normal?
```
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","params":[], "method":"eth_blockNumber", "id":1}' localhost:8547
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x85cb8e"}
```
It's the latest block number at goerli arbitrum scan. I think my nitro is fully synced.

2. I have nitro.ipc file created by nitro's --ipc.path options. but I can't connect because nitro binary doesn't have attach command. I want to know how to connect nitro ipc.
undefined says Ye
undefined says sir i have a question about the bug bounty
i have sent you a dm, please check it
undefined says I think that’s right, arb-goerli doesn’t take so much storage, and did you use -v option to mount to your ipc path within the docker?
undefined says I have nitro.ipc file and nitro binary. But nitro binary doesn't have attach command.
undefined says Use `geth attach path/to/nitro.ipc`
undefined says Do I need geth? nitro doesn't have it?
undefined says Yeah I don't think we provide a CLI client for our RPC
undefined says Please add this feature at next version
undefined says it's syncing ?
undefined says yup
undefined says How long does it take to sync completely?
undefined says It depends on lots of reason, but usually around 3-4 days.
undefined says Hi! How can I prune the node data?
undefined says Guys, does `gas used` (not gas price) also fluctuates depending on the network circumstances?
I'm now testing at arbitrum goerli, and running the same code without any update of contract, and its gas usage is fluctuating from 1x ~ 10x.
undefined says Gg
undefined says We currently do have that, but will support it very soon.
undefined says Yes, you can see how and why here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/faqs/gas-faqs#q-gas-changes
undefined says How to compile binary  through source code.I wanna run the full node with binary instead of docker ?
undefined says We currently don't support non-dockerized versions of the node, but you can look at the Dockerfile to see how it is done.
undefined says 1 block 0.3 seconds?
undefined says I'm not sure what you mean, but Arbitrum can produce up to 4 blocks per second. It will depend on demand though, so it can be lower than that.
undefined says 嗯
undefined says Hey! how do I control execution timeout for debug_traceTransaction? Doesn't seem like it's respecting node.rpc.evm-timeout..
Sample l2 tx hash that occasionally timeouts: 0xa28f858876053351284d44bdb54acca57887b3894682c9feee13fbe26bb36252
Node docker image: offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.9-51f9452
undefined says Hey! Looking in to it and will get back to you soon!
undefined says Alright found it. The reason is `debug_traceTransaction` has its own timeout config field which defaults to 5 seconds (same in ethereum). Look at this: https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/debug_traceTransaction
undefined says Thanks! Will check and revert 🙂
undefined says I mean. How many seconds apart is each block of arbitrum?
like BNB 3second for 1 block
undefined says It is not a fixed amount. In one second the chain can produce between 1 and 4 blocks, depending on the number of transactions to be processed.
undefined says We have initiated a withdrawal from Arb to Mainnet via a gnosis safe and now we face the situation that we can't claim the funds, since we don't have that gnosis safe on mainnet, obviously. Any known workarounds?
undefined says You can try recreating that same safe address on mainnet
undefined says safe 1.3 uses deterministic deployments (using `create2`) so pass the same initializer and salt and it'll be the same address
undefined says Why has the gas price increased recently,I noticed that it sometimes even reaches 10 gwei
undefined says Since we sent the funds to another address than our safe, we were able to manually relay the tx. Thanks for your help though!
undefined says thank you
undefined says SELAM
undefined says We are dealing with an application which submits a high volume of transactions on users behalf, ~50/minute at times, we are seeing quite a few errors regarding nonce too high. We are sending txs in parallel so I suspect some are reaching the sequencer before others, hence the rejection. This is only a hunch though, could anyone here confirm? If this is the case to prevent this we are looking at updating the logic to process the transactions sequentially awaiting each before processing the other, but before we do that I am wondering if anyone here has any other suggestions ?
undefined says Gday team, had a testnet dapp deployed on Arbi Goerli last month, was working fine until last week or so. Balances wont load, was thinking it was a Multicall problem, but Multicall seems to be working fine. Block looks like its syncing but still not updating balances on the frontend
undefined says If you send transactions with out of order nonces, they need to arrive within 1 second of each other. If account A has nonce 0, and you send a tx with nonce 1, the tx with nonce 0 needs to arrive within 1 second of that one or you'll get "nonce too high".
undefined says how can i increase verbosity of my arbitrum node logs? can i add a specific  flag on the nitro startup command ?
undefined says The maximum verbosity is `--log-level=5`
undefined says do you have to enable the relay in the node to subscribe to the sequencer feed locally?
undefined says where can i get a list of all tokens supported by the ethereum to arbitrum bridge?
undefined says Yo
undefined says I don't know where to ask this so I'll try here. I run a node since a few month, it works very well so I would love to participate more and start validating. How can I have my Arbitrum node whitelisted to become a validator please ? Is there a form to complete somewhere ?
undefined says Maybe send as a batch?
undefined says Min 250 ms
undefined says But blocks are produced when there is a transaction to process
undefined says Can someone guide me how does gas limit calculation work on arbitrum? Is it any different from mainnet?
undefined says It's almost the same but the total gas fees need in arbitrum (L2) is much lower than mainnet (L1)
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs @ferizio @jornx I am running the relay node locally like this "docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feedy --l2.chain-id=42161" then I use ws client to connect to relay like this "wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:9642" and I am getting this error "Error: Cannot find module 'https-proxy-agent'"...has anyone ran into this yet?

undefined says How's the progress towards permission-less validators going?
undefined says would be cool to run a node
undefined says anybody else ever get "code 429 - Public RPC Rate Limit Hit"? Im getting it on my own node and on chainstack's
undefined says What is the RPC address you use?
undefined says buddies, what do you use your wss and https rpc address?
undefined says When you mean resync are you synching from scratch ? Because the laatest nitro snapshot itself is 370 GB
undefined says Arbitrum bridge support all token on l1, this is because if our bridge find this is your first time a new token deposit, it will deploy a related token on l2, however, some  projects deploy their token manually on l2 and not by our bridge, we have a list for this (but this is only what we know, we might miss some others): https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-bridge/blob/master/packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/src/util/WithdrawOnlyUtils.ts
undefined says Currently we don’t open whitelist registration.
undefined says It is different, we are 2-dimension model: https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/gas-faqs
undefined says This is because your node hits the rate limit of sequencer, try send less tx per second.
undefined says You should avoid type h i or h e llo
undefined says How lone between you estimateGas and send your tx?
undefined says So weird, isn’t this frequent right? I guess this might because there is some delays between your node and sequencer.
undefined says How you connect it and what is the logs of your node?
undefined says Looking into it
undefined says We still think this is a network delay, and it most happens on l2 gas congestion or l1 gas spike, you can add a higher value on it next time to avoid this.
undefined says Withdrawal doesn’t need the sender on l2 to occur, anyone can call outbox to execute the l2-to-l1 tx.
undefined says Yea, you could do this, since it will not charge more when you set a higher gas limit.
undefined says I thought if your node has some delays on this, the arbos will also face some delays. Just try multiple a little would be ok.
undefined says Yea you can try this, I thought this is because your precompile also needs according to the feed from sequencer to update the gas price as the rpc eth_gasPrcie does.
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs Saw this on Github: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1504
undefined says Did you guys consider this thread from Ethereum? https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/21350
undefined says Lol I've been getting linked it a lot. But unlike geth, these connections are long lived and tomorrow's nonce prefix is knowable in advance. So there's no issue of constant escalation of the nonce.
undefined says I'd prefer to talk here or in the flashbots searchers channel
undefined says Is it possible to send as a batch? Are there additional endpoints available on arbitrum for doing so?
undefined says Team I have encountered another issue, one of our send tx requests responded with gas limit reached, after inspecting the blocks around the time the tx was scheduled there were no blocks which were near full
undefined says Try this: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/batch
undefined says can someone please clarify if l1 url has any sort of impact  on the tx processing times or its just used for initial sync ? I dont have necessary rpc api active and would rather not restart node
undefined says can i have rpc public ?
undefined says Once the node is fully synced, the L1 node is used to validate the contents of the transactions read from the sequencer feed.
It does not impact processing time, because it will process txs from the sequencer feed first (and later validate them with the L1 batches).
undefined says You can find our public RPCs in this page => https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains
undefined says thank you
undefined says so I guess it has no impact on node's performance then and it's pointless running an ETH node on the same server as the arbitrum one . 

Thanks, appreciate the explanation !
undefined says This is a real problem. it happen all the time. never had this issue on any other chains. Could you increase rate limit ? we are not Ddosing your servers... we are just heavy users on our own nodes
undefined says Do nodes need to be updated due to this change? If not, what sort of delay in ms is expected for non-participants compared to the first priority connection?
undefined says No need to be update nodes, and 50ms
undefined says Ok. Thanks for the quick response
undefined says yes, can you please increase rate limit ? thanks !
undefined says I've updated the relay ordering scheme a bit to include a nonce target. Clients are now sorted by nonce target instead of nonce hash, and your nonce score must be as good or better than your nonce target. The nonce score is basically 256 - log2(nonceHash). The trick is that the nonce target is part of the preimage of the hash, so you can't just set the target to the score you get. This avoids a situation where, in the process of mining the best hash, you also find the top 25 hashes and can fill those slots
. Full details are in the PR: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1504 cc @happypsyduck
undefined says is it possible to download a more recent Arbitrum One node snapshot from somewhere?
undefined says Guys i love arb ecosystem, also love the chain itself , but i was always thinking that the l2 would be with much lower fees after nitro upgrade.... so want to ask tech related people , is there gonna be decrease of gas fees in future ? if yes when and for how much?
undefined says Very clever
undefined says I hope this solution helps remove the sequencer bloat that has been weighing on the network
undefined says Much better :catJam:
undefined says I have posted a longer-form post on the Arbitrum research forum discussing my concerns with PR 1504, namely that it is economically wasteful and leaves much room for improvement, while respecting the constraint of ease of implementation. I suggest alternative auction designs that are as easy to implement and which are far more economically efficient.

Is it ok if I bridge from another adress on polygon to arbitrum ? adress A on polygon send to adress B (not linked) in arb
undefined says guys how can we update the node to v 3.1.0 ?
undefined says and i got this
undefined says can anyone help me please ?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs
undefined says wont PR 1504 reduce the number of searchers(aka centralize) that can profitably capture MEV as well?
undefined says Anyone can build a gpu hash miner
undefined says Only profits - x goes to mining the hash, but people are mad because it's burning money and it is burning money
undefined says wont more hashing power increase the chance of being the top 25 subscribers with the lowest nonce? I think I am missing something
undefined says Yep, but it won't "centralize" mev extraction
undefined says I forgot its possible to rent hashpower
undefined says Validating public identities / Sybil resistance would be tricky. Any sort of automated checks like captchas or even phone numbers would be bought, and we don't have spare people sitting around to do manual verification of identities for everyone who wants to be a searcher.
undefined says That error looks like two go routines wrote data to the same mem location
undefined says Can you share more?
undefined says Shouldn't ever happen to a client
undefined says Seems like you just found a bug my fren
undefined says Ahh makes sense
undefined says rate limit is same from my own private node / frompublic RPC direclty /  on my scripts ?
undefined says For `eth_sendRawTransaction`, yes, since your local node will forward those to the sequencer. But do note that successful transactions aren't counted against the rate limit!
undefined says It'd help to run your local node with `--node.tx-pre-checker-strictness=20` which will locally reject transactions that would likely fail later anyways, and locally rejected txs of course wouldn't count against the rate limit
undefined says - where can i find more informations about this flag ? `--node.tx-pre-checker-strictness`
- what is the actual rate limit ?
undefined says - `nitro --help` will give you a bit of info. But I'd recommend just trying it out and seeing if it fixes your issue 🙂 
- I'm not sure and it's subject to change, so you shouldn't rely on its exact current value
undefined says ohh really ?
undefined says where can i submitte this bug ?
undefined says and how can i fix it ?
undefined says can you accept my friend request please ! 🙏

undefined says It is going to take days for me...
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/blocks
undefined says I'm looking at the blocks here to understand what the gas limit is and I'm surprised to see that there is basically an infinite gas limit.
undefined says What is happening here? I'm also surprised to see that the "block" with the highest amount of transactions is only 5.
undefined says how to check status sync done ?
undefined says Your log will tell you current synced block, you can compare it with our latest block number
undefined says it's same
undefined says Arbitrum doesn’t have fixed block time, so it doesn’t like others evm chains we can use a block limit to measure it, we have single tx gas limit which is 32m.
undefined says If so, your node finished syncing and is at the latest state.
undefined says i tried connecting rpc but it failed
undefined says It is up to your hardware and network status, you can also use a faster l1 rpc which may help
undefined says Do you set your node docker’s mapping port to 8597?
undefined says docker run -d -v ~/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8597:8597 -p 0.0.0.0:8598:8598 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-rc.2-b3ab37e --l1.url $L1URL --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says yes
undefined says No, it’s just the block number you can see on arbiscan: https://developer.arbitrum.io/time#arbitrum-block-numbers
undefined says Your port mapping is wrong: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#important-ports
undefined says We set rpc port at 8547
undefined says And ws port at 8548
undefined says cant change it? 8547 same my bsc node

undefined says We have validators list here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses#validators , as for the for public registration, we currently don’t have timeline.
undefined says Can I ask here about an archive node?

If I would like to run the archive node, I should run it starting from classic then migrate to nitro, right?
undefined says I saw you restart your node right? And wrote data to the same location, what is this same location compared to?
undefined says Nope, you should both run nitro and classic to get all archive data. If you just run classic or nitro archive, you only get part of them.
undefined says Hey! I was trying to run classic archive node. Is there any snapshot available for the same? I found a link on this group (https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db-archive.tar ) but it isnt working anymore. Please help!
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
undefined says Thanks! Just one more question. How to give this snapshot to classic node? The --init url would work? or I need to extract in the data folder of arbitrum manually?
undefined says ok ，I will try  to run my node
undefined says You should download and untar it manually for classic node.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs , Can you check your DM please? I asked WETH's addres on Arbitrum Goerli testnet. Can you please let me know it?
undefined says Replied
undefined says One more question now. I just deploy the Multicall contract on ETH Goerli and Arbitrum Goerli and tried to get ETH values of wallet.
The eth value was showed exactly on ETH Goerli. But It doesn't show on Arbitrum Goerli.
Could you let me know the reason? And also, could you send me the Multicall contract address on Arbitrum Goerli?
undefined says You mean show on your wallet UI?
undefined says I just updated the RPC, Multicall and WETH addresss and tried on both of ETH goerli and Arbitrum Goerli. ETH Goerli works. But Arbiturm Goeril doesn't work.
I have deployed the same Multicall contract of Uniswap/Pancakeswap exactly on Arbitrum Goerli network.
undefined says Multicall address here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/useful-addresses#misc
undefined says How do you get that balance?
undefined says Using the Multicall
undefined says you can try this one I sent to you
undefined says Ok, I'm trying now.
undefined says Awesome! It works!
undefined says yeap, i restart the node because didn't receive a reply and  their is no aprroved block, should i create a new app on alchemy ?
undefined says Hello! I'm working with Arbitrum traces and I'm seeing some fields related to beforeEVMTransfers and afterEVMTransfers in the trace data. Can someone please point me to any documentation or resources that explain what these fields represent and what kind of information I can expect to see in them? Thank you
undefined says Hello:)
Can someone give me advice: I have synced archive Arbitrum node, and I need to run another one on different machine. What will be faster: send data from host to host (stopping node) or sync from public snapshot?
undefined says I transfered my USDT from arbitrum network to ETH  on Arbitrum network in binance wallet .
but binance does not support usdt deposit on Arbitrum network .

so in order to claim my fund binance asking for Transaction Hash. but when I am checking the block Explorer of arbitrum one there is no transaction.im trying to open the link of my transcation it showung me " Sorry, we are unable to locate this transaction hash " .
undefined says Im using metamask extension on brave browser . and to transfer my fund i used metamask send feature.

check below images i did the transaction in my metamask wallet on 27 feb which is today...but on block explorer there is no transaction of today..
undefined says in other chain each transaction either it success air fail creates the hash
undefined says this seems to be a bug or something . please check it ...this is not good for the chain kindly check and help me to get the transaction hash..
undefined says The transaction id that metamask giving me is invalid
undefined says i gave this trnsaction id to Binance team
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Could you describe how you start your node and what leads you to this errors? And alchemy here is your l1 rpc right?
undefined says Im looking to speak with developers who are launching projects in the next few weeks, is there a dedicated developer channel?
undefined says help me this is little seriuos this will make you worried devs ....
undefined says what's the expected disk requirements for a full archive node? I know the docs say 1.3 TB
undefined says but my full archive node is at ~1.8 TB currently
undefined says Is the proof of work method really the best solution for prioritising sequencer connections? As a few people have said, surely there's a solution that has the same properties, but leads to the searchers' money flowing to the Arbitrum ecosystem rather than being spent on electricity?
undefined says Probably not the best publicity for Arbitrum when it transpires that $1m+ per year is going directly into CO2 production, just to order connections on their sequencer.
undefined says Perhaps a smart contract, where searchers pay a few dollars to enter, and they're allocated a random number picked from a distribution between 0 and 1, assigned to an IP of their choice
undefined says Connections are then prioritised based on highest to lowest assigned number. You can enter multiple times, to attempt to be allocated a higher number. This process is repeated daily or weekly or whatever
undefined says This mimics the forced expenditure of the PoW method, and keeps the element of luck
undefined says I've had to do the same multiple times and found the easiest and fastest is just use rsync with compression to send the data
undefined says Can you provide an example (or short manual), please? Never did it before, afraid of losing data in process 🙂
undefined says https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh is a good basic guide. So your command would look like:
rsync -aP ~/SourceDirectory/ username@REMOTE_HOST:~/Destination

Now depending on your setup, you could use the -z flag for compression. Saves bandwidth at the cost of compression/decompression on the source and destination machines. If you have tons of transfer bandwidth, don't worry about it, but if you have a limited amount then I'd use it because your sending a lot of data
undefined says rsync is pretty awesome and using in archive mode should be very safe from a loss-of-data perspective. it sends diffs and compares the files so you can even halt halfway through and restart and it should not have to start from scratch either
undefined says Thanks a lot, will try tomorrow 🙂
undefined says Is the sequencer re location only for arbitrum one or is it also going to happen for nova?
undefined says I imagine it would be for the entire ecosystem
undefined says I don't see any changes yet though
undefined says It appears there is a delay on the PR for now: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1504#issuecomment-1446931538
undefined says It probably hasn't taken place yet
undefined says R u in nova?
undefined says May need to wait for the team to answer your question as I only run a node on One
undefined says I thought you were doing arbs, that's why i asked haha
undefined says Yeah, my team does arbitrage as a part of our protocol suite, but typically not necessarily the fast arbitrage that is being discussed here
undefined says More longer price action movements involving multiple correlating tokens
undefined says I see
undefined says On average the growth rate is 14 GB for archival node. you can have a guess on that + as you said it's currently around 1.8TB
undefined says What about the production of blocks? There are many blocks right next to eachother, at the same second, according to the blockscanner at least. I imagine they're not being produced simultaneously, just close together. How does one block have two transactions while another block has a different number?
undefined says Hey,
we have these `beforeEVMTransfers` and `afterEVMTransfers` for value transfer outside of evm context. For instance when you send ETH from L1 to L2, gas refund would be through these.
Checking these lines of codes may help:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/93c8207f1ee0b91f1e6104f5cddab5bda74eb1ed/eth/tracers/native/tracer_arbitrum.go#L33

undefined says Could you please ask it on #📬︱support channel?
undefined says gotcha, thanks for the sanity check. Is there a way to split the data between two disks? Like using sym links or something?
undefined says You can probably put the ancient directory on another disk with a symlink, but not sure about it
undefined says We've not decided on this yet. Let's wait for future and see what'll happen
undefined says I'm having a difficult time comprehending installing a local arb node.  I am following the official docs here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node and I've done steps 1 and 2 but now what?  The guide kinda ends and I'm left with an open terminal and no directions on what to do now.  I just want to be able to submit my own swap transactions without having to rely on a third-party node provider or have to go through metamask wallet.
undefined says Sir im not asking for refund or something...
undefined says Im asking for why transaction hash does not create....
undefined says Is it possible that any transaction does not generate transaction hash ...
undefined says Cus as far as ik all transaction generate transaction hash... It does not matter transaction succedd or fail
undefined says Yeah I know ser. I asked to send it on Support channel because we’re using zendesk to handle this kind of questions that needs info like address, etc
undefined says Oh, if you want to interact with our public network, you should follow this guide: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node , that guide you see if for dev local test.
undefined says I did
undefined says Support sent me here
undefined says Just help me with this
undefined says Could you send me a DM, so I can share the tx hash with you
undefined says I read that before it is really confusing and advanced as I never used docker before.  Do I need to have an ETH node installed locally to run my Arbi node?
undefined says Yess sir ...thank you so much
undefined says You can also use 3rd party l1 rpc service
undefined says Would using 3rd party service defeat the purpose if I want to make my own swaps with no restrictions?
undefined says Your node won’t interact with l1, it will just read da information from l1
undefined says Have a couple questions deploying a game contract to arbitrum goerli.
undefined says 1) Can anyone recommend a bridge for ERC721 tokens for arbitrum goerli.
undefined says 2) My game contracts reference these two contracts on mainnet. How does arbitrum handle this since these will not be deployed on arbitrum.
undefined says 1. I don’t think there is a general NFT bridge on goerli, because general nft has too many tough cases to handle.
2. If your contract want to interact with each others, for l1 to l2 tx, I would recommend this tutorial: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter, for l2 to l1 tx, you can use this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/outbox-execute, but it will take 7-8 days from l2 to l1, you can also use oracle to do this.
undefined says Thank you. A few follow-ups. For games with existing contracts (ERC721 & ERC20) on mainnet, what's the general recommendation? I had assumed I could just bridge my assets over and reference them.

My game contracts which will run on arbitrum just call read only views. Is that possible without an oracle? IE ownerOf + some custom views. Feels like using an oracle would defeat the purpose of an on-chain game. But perhaps I'm not understanding you fully.
undefined says You mean call l1 contract’s OwnerOf function from l2? Just use our bridge can’t give you fast return (l1 to l2 tx needs 15 minutes, l2 to l1 needs 7 days), and seems your tx needs both l1 to l2 and l2 to l1. Although l2 based on l1, but they are still 2 different network, they don’t share the same state.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs i have a question about Arbitrum node
Can i enable  "graphql" in aribtrum node ?
I saw it was merged https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/593/files#diff-3fde9d1a396e140fefc7676e1bd237d67b6864552b6f45af1ebcc27bcd0bb6e9R70
But how can i enable it ?
undefined says Sure, it will run on :8547/graphql
undefined says oh thank you, i will check my node
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs i check my node but this option not work. It's response 404 
Can you give me document or command to enable  graphql when start node?
undefined says Hmm, how do you start it?
undefined says It will work if you just add —graphql.enable
undefined says a thank you. 
I was add `--graphql` only  
I will add it in my node again
undefined says Why I can't use eth_getBlockByNumber method on arbitrum?
undefined says Of course you can, what errors you got?
undefined says 
undefined says Was the hosts migration (from Oregon to somewhere else) only affecting the feed servers? Or sequencer was also moved?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1077629187038388264
undefined says What host migration?
undefined says 
undefined says anyone has an average number of blocks/day?
undefined says i want to use it as a pseudo time metric
undefined says any guides on how to setup and run my own full node?
undefined says Tks, It can work now.
undefined says Is arbitrum unable to obtain pending transactions?
undefined says We don’t have mempool, so that rpc won’t work
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Arbitrum doesn’t have fixed block time, and that number vary every day.
undefined says yeah i am just trying to get an average
undefined says Average is also not possible, just like this daily tx curve: https://arbiscan.io/chart/tx
undefined says check dm plz
undefined says I'm getting an error from my pre nitro archive node when calling eth_getCode: err="Post "http://127.0.0.1:8557/": EOF". Has anyone else experienced this?
undefined says Can be Arbitrum node in watchtower mode used as RPC for http/ws requests?
undefined says getting logs pre nitro works fine so I am pretty confident that my network setup is ok
undefined says also appears with eth_getBalance
undefined says Sure you can
undefined says Is your node syncing?
undefined says my nitro node 100% yes, and the pre nitro node is at the last pre nitro block i think
undefined says the classic node output is :
Previous checkpoint,  total gas used: 0, L1 block: 0, L2 block: 0, log count: 0, messages count: 0, timestamp: Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970

and has been that way for several days now
undefined says When you call eth_getCode and get eof, do you see anything on your logs?
undefined says the classic node? no nothing changes.  But that's the same for the successful getLogs calls though
undefined says So you are calling your classic node rather than nitro node?
undefined says no, I am only calling the nitro node which is pointed to the classic node
undefined says eth_getCode should not point to classic node
undefined says You can add `--log-level=5` to your nitro node and see if any error reasons show when you call that rpc method.
undefined says when I say pointed, I mean I am using the command line argument --node.rpc.classic-redirect on the nitro node which is the url of the classic node
undefined says I do see an error in the nitro node logs for eth_getCode- that  error I posted above: err="Post "http://127.0.0.1:8557/": EOF" is from the nitro logs when I call eth_getCode
undefined says Is this on your nitro node’s log? What process is running at your 8557?
undefined says correct yeah, that error is in my nitro log. im running two different docker processes, one for nitro and one for classic
undefined says This is a sample RPC call to the nitro node:
{
    "method": "eth_getCode",
    "params": [
        "0x80A9ae39310abf666A87C743d6ebBD0E8C42158E",
        "0xf93cbe"
    ],
    "id": "6"
}
And the response from the nitro node:
Post "http://127.0.0.1:8557": EOF, for msg 6:

And that EOF error also appears in the nitro log
undefined says I also took down my classic node to make sure it wasn't some weird networking issue and received, as expected, a connection refused error from the nitro node when making the above call:
Post "http://127.0.0.1:8557": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8557: connect: connection refused,

So i believe it is not an issue of connection between my nitro node and classic node

I also do not think it is an issue with how I am constructing the RPC call either because I can use third party archive nodes and successfully get data from that RPC call
undefined says 8557 is your classic node’s rpc port?
undefined says yup
undefined says Oh, I see, you are making a archive call, what I am guessing is your classic node is initializing, and usually it will take a few hours, during this time it can not serve rpc call, you’d better wait a few hours.
undefined says but it's been running for a week now? and i can get logs successfully?
undefined says Can you send a call directly to your archive node for this?
undefined says hmm just tried to get the block number from the archive node and it's also empty. so this means my archive node is not working then?
undefined says what would cause it to hang for a week?
undefined says If your classic node is initializing , it should show connection refused, how do you sync your classic node? By our snapshot or sync from genesis?
undefined says your snapshot
undefined says Kinda weird, looking into this.
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says Do you make this: https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/docker-network-example/ ?
undefined says I’ll take a look at this but since I get an EOF msg, doesn’t that mean the containers are successfully connecting? I.e. not a networking issue?
undefined says ok i don't think this is the issue, my containers are accessible from one another. I started to resync my classic node on another instance, instead of using the available snapshot, to see if that helps
undefined says so the block.timestamp is set by the sequencer right ?
undefined says Hey, yes! Right before a block is produced, the sequencer grabs its current local timestamp and that's the timestamp on the block
undefined says The sequencer can specify a timestamp that's up to 1 day old or up to IIRC 1 hour in the future, but always monotonically increasing
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c479675ad559DC151F6Ec7ed3FbF8ceE79582B6#readProxyContract
undefined says same goes for the l1block number, you can find the config per Arbitrum chain in their sequencer inbox
undefined says Okay thanks for the technical details. Sheesh, this control would make a decentralized sequencer more challenging.
undefined says One more question, what's the threat model of decreasing the force inclusion period on the delayed inbox from 24 hours to. .  1 hour? 12.8 min?
undefined says Is it about L1 finality?

What's the worst case scenario. . . 

L1 finalizes after 2 epochs, if there's a client bug in geth and 2/3 of L1 validators are knocked offline, it'll take at least a week before mainnet finalizes again.

Nitro is based on geth, so nitro execution would get rekt, not sure if there would be a solution here, depends on the type of bug in geth.
undefined says imo it's entirely possible, the delay is mostly there to prevent a L1 reorg causing L2 reorg
undefined says Stopped node on source machine, rsynced all docker-volumes to target machine, started node again - waited about 5-10 minutes on stage "Head state missing, repairing" then synced new blocks, now I have this node synced and working properly.
But on the target machine it's stuck on this stage for an hour, and is still there. Is it normal for machine with almost minimum required specification?
undefined says Hey! I was running classic archive node using the snapshot db.tar. It is stuck at "last database checkpoint" since around 30 hours. It infact crashed in between also during this step. What can I do to solve this? Please help! Thanks
undefined says u need more ram
undefined says Thanks! What could be the required RAM according to you? TIA!
undefined says is it possible for miners to manipulate timestamp on Arbitrum chain?
undefined says I’m looking at beforeEVMTransfers and afterEVMTransfers. Do you know how purposes: escrow, prepaid, gasRefund, undoRefund and refund, affect addresses balance? do you know if there are more purposes? Can you please help me with some documentation detailed about that? Thank you!
undefined says The "value" field indicates how much balance is moved from "from" to "to". If "from" or "to" is null, then it's a mint or a burn, respectively. For instance a deposit starts with a mint of L2 ether, and a withdrawal has a burn though it's inside of the evm not before or after. The "purpose" is an approximate description of why the balance was moved (e.g. "gasRefund" is when geth gives you back balance for any gas you didn't use for but paid for at the beginning) but we don't have an exhaustive list of purposes as we might add more in the future.
undefined says I don't understand a time is specified, why is the entire timebound emitted in the event SequencerBatchDelivered https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/f189435015227ee8557b3f3c01b090f7b16eb8eb/contracts/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L167

undefined says in the L2 STF, the tx l1block and timestamp will be bound to that range
undefined says iirc classic node require 32gb+
undefined says Dear admin or team, could you please explain how exactly Arbitrum generates fees/ravenue?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/gas-faqs
undefined says No, the block.timestamp is based on the Sequencer's clock. You can read about it here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/misc-faqs#q-blocknum
undefined says node
undefined says nitro
undefined says Umh, I am not sure why my questions is getting blocked by the moderation filter...
undefined says is there a way to check the list of blacklisted words?
undefined says my quesotin in a generic way: is there any way to reduce the maount of disk uasge by the node?
undefined says Words like "h i" and "h e l l o" are the most common words to get filtered by the bot.
undefined says Not at the moment, but we are working on supporting pruning soon.
undefined says that explains it! (I would say that is problematic... is it that bad to say hi! on the beginning of a sentence?) Thank you so much
undefined says I see, thank you!
undefined says It's mainly to avoid spam, but yeah, I understand it can be a bit confusing sometimes.
undefined says Yesterday I had to stop my node. but when I try to restart I get ' head state missing, repairing number 65,311,906 ' warning. but the nodes are not progressing. what can i do here
undefined says 
undefined says validate your nodes ?
undefined says It doesn't have anything to do with validating nodes, ser
undefined says When shutting down the nodes, if not done properly, it might take a while for it to repair. I don't have an actual time frame, though.
How long has it been in this state?
undefined says When I ran the image file with docker, the blocks were starting to progress. Also, I didn't do anything else.
undefined says Your node is fine. It probably just didn't shut down properly. How long has it been repairing?
undefined says When my server ran out of RAM, proxmox shut down this virtual machine. He waited 10-12 hours. but nothing changes.
undefined says Do you have enough RAM for it to properly run again? Also, the repairing process might take longer if not enough RAM is provided (Check here for recommended specs: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration )
undefined says Besides that, if it's taking too long, I would advice to resync your database.
undefined says yes, I reserved 32gb ram for Arbitrum. When all the ram capacity (204gb) of the server starts to be used, proxmox closes the 1st (arbitrum) vps. Now I've freed up some space from the total ram capacity.I will look again tonight. I'll try adding some more ram.
undefined says Perfect. Let us know how it goes 💪
undefined says Hey!
My node started failing last night with this last night
`error initializing database              err="write /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata/MANIFEST-22896483: no space left on device"` 
Any idea what might fix it? I added 2 new physical drives and added them to the lvm this morning and am still getting the error.
undefined says @nuliknol , let me rephrase my answer, because I assumed some reasoning behind your question and I might not be correct.

Miners (the Sequencer) can in fact manipulate the timestamp of a transaction within some bounds (up to 24h earlier or 1 hour later) and restrictions (must be further in the future than last sequenced transaction), but it generally uses its internal clock to set the timestamp. Users shotaro and gzeon just talked about that in messages before yours.

Please, let us know if you have more specific questions regarding this.
undefined says Have you also increased the size of your docker volume? (i.e., can you verify that docker can use that new space?)
undefined says Hello! Do you know why each block from Nitro has a transaction from and to this address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b05?
undefined says Is it possible to get the separate L2 gasLimit and L1 Fee when estimatingGas (instead of getting the sum of L1Fee + L2 gasLimit)
undefined says yep! https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/f189435015227ee8557b3f3c01b090f7b16eb8eb/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L84
undefined says That's a special StartBlock() internal transaction used to make various bookkeeping actions traceable, at the start of every block.
undefined says Thanks, I'll test it now!
undefined says what exactly is the gas price on Arbitrum?
undefined says on arbiscan i am seeing txns with 0.1 gwei
on nitro.arbiscan i am seeing txns with 0.01 gwei
when fetching gas price from alchemy rpc, i am getting 0.001 gwei
undefined says how exactly can i calculate the total cost of a txn on arbitrum
undefined says I increased ram and cpu about 1 hour ago. I restarted the image with Docker. This is my screen. How long does this repair estimate take?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says There is no NodeInterface ABI in address  'C8 '
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8#readContract
undefined says 
undefined says It's there, you just have to eth_call it
undefined says it can't be accessed on-chain only via the RPC
undefined says it looks like arbiscan's ABI is slightly outdated for it but you can still call it
undefined says 
undefined says Do an eth_call instead of an eth_estimateGas
undefined says ok tks!
undefined says my mistake🤣
undefined says how exactly do we get the total txn cost ?
undefined says I'm not too adept with docker, but from my understanding mounting local storage shouldn't require that? If I'm wrong, could you point me at some documentation on it?
undefined says you might have specified the wrong mount path
undefined says Hey, you can find out how Arbitrum calculate fees here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

If you're looking for specific functions to call, you can make use of ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei(), which will give you all gas data you need. For the L1 part, you have the second value returned which will give you the fees to be paid for each byte of data of your transaction, and for the L2 part, you have the sixth value returned => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L34-L44 .

Hope this helps you.
undefined says I'm not sure about time frames for the repair operation, but if it's taking too long, you might need to resync your database.
undefined says so even though the gas price from `eth_gasPrice` stays constant at 0.1 gwei, the gas units used is regulated to account for the L1 cost too?
undefined says does that mean a normal transfer would be taking up more than 21000 gas?
undefined says and so the total cost of a txn would be `eth_estimateGas * eth_gasPrice` itself on Arbitrum?
undefined says What do you mean by resync? Installing node from scratch?
undefined says 1) Yes, although eth_gasPrice might increase if there's a lot of demand, although it usually stays at 0.1 gwei
2) Yes
3) Yes
😄
undefined says Just syncing your database from scratch or using a more recent snapshot
undefined says is there any source where i can download new snapshot. can you help me 🙂
undefined says The node's been running for a while now, that error just started last night.
undefined says Sure! This is the most recent snapshot we have: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says Hope that fixes your problem
undefined says can you share the startup command? my guess is the path is not mounted correctly and you are writing to the container volume
undefined says `/usr/bin/docker run --network host --name Arbitrum --rm -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://localhost:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*`

undefined says I sent you a private message. I will be glad if you look. :arbheart:
undefined says Is there somewhere I can learn about what the --rm and -v flags do?
undefined says I can't actually figure out where my database is... /home/user/.arbitrum doesn't exist, and I am trying to figure out what the purpose of each side of the colon is in - v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/arbitrum
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Those are "docker run" specific parameters, you can find more info in their docs: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/
(Search for the parameters you want more info on)

For your specific question, /some/local/dir/arbitrum refers to a location in your filesystem, while /home/user/.arbitrum refers to a location inside the container (the former will be mounted on the later). Find more info on volumes here => https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems
undefined says Thank you!!
undefined says I'm getting no response from the sequencer feed when i try to connect, not even time out
undefined says is there an upgrade going on?
undefined says Who are you?
undefined says does nitro have its own discord?
undefined says hey guys
undefined says I'm trying to start arbitrum one on my server
undefined says but I get an error while initialising database
undefined says 
undefined says I was looking at fields beforeEVMTransfers and afterEVMTransfers in transactions traces. I know that L1 fees goes to L1PricerFundsPoolAddress but I see another address in fee payment, this is 0xD345e41aE2cb00311956aA7109fC801Ae8c81a52. Does this address refer to l2 fees? Thanks in advance
undefined says Do you know why each block from Nitro has a transaction from and to this address 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b05?
undefined says I am trying to get a way to empty a wallet (send all funds)
undefined says how to do that? it seems like the gas used for a simple (empty data) transactions is variable
undefined says Look at the right, you need to set an --init argument
undefined says > Miners (the Sequencer) can in fact manipulate the timestamp of a transaction within some bounds (up to 24h earlier or 1 hour later) a
thanks a lot! this is enough! I appreciate the support
undefined says How is this different than what was proposed on the forum as a long term solution or is it the same thing? https://offchain.medium.com/time-boost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy-for-arbitrum-5b3066382d62
undefined says This one: https://research.arbitrum.io/t/hybrid-transaction-ordering-policy/155
undefined says It's the same thing, though I think we've put some more work into it and revised it since that first research post
undefined says What url you are trying to connect?
undefined says Do you add ` --init.url` to your start command?
undefined says This address is alias address of 0xC234E41AE2cb00311956Aa7109fC801ae8c80941, which is our multisig address on l1.
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1080526444616220736
undefined says Fixed it, it was my problem. Sorry
undefined says Is it possible to calculate the L1gasLimit required for a transaction without using gasEstimateComponents function (estimation), 

e.g. calculated from L1's gasprice, L2's calldata, etc.
undefined says This could be a way: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/f189435015227ee8557b3f3c01b090f7b16eb8eb/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L361 but since we will compress the data pushed to l1 and it hard to estimate the compress rate without using tools, so I thought precompile way is the best way to estimate.
undefined says Thanks , I will read it now
undefined says Lfg
undefined says I try to deploy my smart contract on Arbitrum, when I deployed token ERC20 I see work well, but when I deploy contract staking I got the error `Error HH110: Invalid JSON-RPC response received: {"error":"Request dropped Cause: Request was dropped"}`.  @@
undefined says I don't know how to fix it, I try limit gas to 10 gwei and contract is work well on another network
undefined says О
undefined says Hey!
It looks like Hardhat is receiving an error indicating that the transaction dropped. This can happen for multiple reasons (incorrect nonce, runs out of gas, timeout, ... )
Can you send the transaction hash of the contract deployment so we can verify if the data submitted is correct? (You can share it on DM if you don't want to share it here)
undefined says Mmm, it will be difficult to completely empty the wallet, because of how Arbitrum estimates gas usage (adding an L1 component which is variable). You can read more about it here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

You can estimate the gas limit, but the final gas used probably won't be exactly the same.
undefined says Hey all, my company would like to sponsor hackathons, incubations and accelerator programs on Arbitrum. Who to message for this ? 🙂
undefined says Hey Thanos!
As I mentioned by DM,  you can drop an e-mail to partnerships@offchainlabs.com .
undefined says im having a lot of problems deploying to goerli arb, what gas levels are people using?
undefined says 
undefined says been like this for a long time
undefined says Hey, it looks like arbiscan is facing some issues for Goerli right now. I'm sure they'll solve those soon though.

In the meanwhile, you could connect to a node and query that tx to verify it's been executed.
undefined says so goerli is not down right?
undefined says its the problem with arbiscan
undefined says Exactly. Goerli is operating normally.
undefined says thanks
undefined says thank you, I am going to be very sad to leave ETH dust in several wallets =(( But I guess that is life.
undefined says Hi! I'm getting timed out when checking, with arb-sdk , if a hash/retryable was redeemed or not, in Arbitrum one.
Error: `Timed out waiting to retrieve retryable creation receipt`
Arb-sdk: `v3.0.0`
undefined says ok, thanks for the info. will do that. cheers!
undefined says How long are you waiting? Retryables take around 15-20 minutes to redeem automatically. Keep that in mind if you're passing a "timeout" argument to the function.

It might also happen that not enough gas is provided and the ticket is not redeemed on L2, although I think that error is thrown before trying to redeem the ticket.
undefined says Can't tell you the time since I'm not monitoring it. Have some scripts running on some servers.

Not passing any timeout arguments, and tickets are being successfully auto-redeemed. I'm just checking if they need to, so the function times out but no manual redeem is ever done (so gas is indifferent here)
undefined says It's timing out here:
```js
const messages = await 
l1Receipt.getL1ToL2Messages(l2Wallet);
const message = messages[0];
const messageRec = await message.waitForStatus();
```
undefined says Code looks fine 🤔 
The only thing I can think of is that your script is timing out for two possible reasons:
1) Your function/script/exec environment/architecture has a low timeout set for the execution of that piece of code
2) Redeeming is taking longer than usual. We have no alerts in our end about this right now, though.

It would be good if you could measure the time in one of your instances. Also, if you send me some of the L1 txs for tickets that timeout, I can see whether they were redeemed within regular times (you can DM them to me if you want).
undefined says Almost sure it's the second one. I had the same problem a while back in Goerli, and you guys solved it by increasing the timeout to cover for these situations.

You can check that conv here: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1022200530921066496

As for the L1 tx, dm'ing it to you
undefined says Didn't think it would happen in mainnet. That's why didn't mention this in the beginning
undefined says Can you guys do that here in a new minor patch? Increase the timeout on the sdk?
undefined says Let me take a look and see what we can do 💪
undefined says does nitro have its own discord?
undefined says No ser, you can ask questions related to that here (nitro is the tech behind Arb One)
undefined says Is there an official guide on how to update to the latest version of nitro?
undefined says sorry, can i dm you
undefined says You only need to gracefully shutdown your node so that it can write the state to disk accurately and resume later.
To do so, run: `docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)` as mentioned in the docs, then restart your node with the new docker image and you're good to go.
undefined says May I know about what?
undefined says thank you!
undefined says does anyone know how to retrieve the list of tx hashs from a "batch" number ?
undefined says is there anything that is more noob friendly?
undefined says the guide doesn't list all the prerequisites to get started. it just kind of jumps right in
undefined says I have a question and would like to get some reference.

We already have a main chain and a test chain, and we are currently seeking a cross-chain bridge solution to connect to Binance Smart Chain.

Our plan is to use Arbi as a cross-chain intermediate node on our own Geth native chain L1, and then cross-chain to Binance Smart Chain through Arbi. So, where should we deploy our cross-chain routing contract and cross-chain contract, on L1 or L2?
undefined says pls help me
undefined says hướng dẫn mình cài node được không bạn
undefined says The way to find the tx in a given batch is just use this https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L60 as a helper, and you can use binary search to find the block range in the specific batch number.
undefined says What others information you wanna know? This is the only one tutorial to deploy your node
undefined says If you want to using arbi as a relayer, you should deploy on l2. And any ideas why you wanna use arb1 as a relayer?
undefined says do i just assume that guide is talking about running all those commands on some linux distro from the terminal console?
undefined says You can just use those command mentioned there to start is fine: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#putting-it-all-together
undefined says how to solve this problem?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  
wss://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/feed cannot be accessed
undefined says somebody help me.
undefined says How do you connect it?
undefined says May I ask the reason you connect it?
undefined says w3 = Web3(Web3.WebsocketProvider("wss://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/feed"))
undefined says In this way, we want to catch events that occur in the blockchain.
undefined says If you want to access blockchain state, this url won’t work, it just send you feed data from sequencer, you should use 3rd party’s service for this
undefined says i got it. thank you sir.
undefined says My arbitrum classic node is crashing again and again. I increased the RAM to 32 gb and yet it is still crashing(as soon as it reaches 80% usage of RAM). I used the snapshot. Any solutions? Also how much time approximately would it take if I sync the classic node from scratch? Please help!
undefined says The ram depends on the load of your requests, maybe you should slow down your request .
undefined says I am not sure how long classic archive node will need to sync, but it should take up to few weeks if I remember correct.
undefined says I have a pretty large view function in my contract. It's building an svg. It works for all but one type of NFT. On Ethereum Goerli it works perfectly fine, but on Arbitrum Goerli it runs out of gas during this view call.

is there a view gas limit different on etherscan between the two test networks? I assume if I run my own node I can complete this view run, but is there a way to buffer this call so it works on etherscan and other services?
undefined says I have added you as a friend.
undefined says How can i slowdown requests? Basically it is crashing while verifying the db.  Thanks!
undefined says You can set --node.rpc.gas-cap manually, this is the gas limit that eth_call/estimateGas can be used to execute, e.g  `--node.rpc.gas-cap 1000000`
undefined says What is your disk? Is it NVMe?
undefined says using gcp e2 standard 8....disks are balanced ssd

undefined says It’s weird, initialize should not take so much ram during initial, can you confirm it shutdown due to oom though system logs?
undefined says Some of the last logs are:

I am attaching the ram pic:
undefined says So the timeBoundary is monotonically increasing, but  the sequencer has the freedom to assign individual messages distinct timestamps in the timeBoundary?

So a batch could include msgs with timestamps which are before the timestamps in a previous batch even though the txns in the new batch are ordered after the old batch?
undefined says Do you have your docker container exit status code? And does the node’s log says anything when shutdown?
undefined says just dies with code 137
undefined says Yo, can i write to you in private messages? I would like to talk about a possible partnership
undefined says quite sure their timestamp still need to be monotonically increasing
undefined says Hey I am a bit confused about Arbitrum gas, could someone help me clear up something please

What does `gasleft()` on Arbitrum include exactly? the whole whatever gas is left for L1 and L2 right? 
Is there a way how I could reserve an amount of gas e.g. to make sure an event can be emitted? 
E.g. on L1, given that I estimate I need max 15k gas to emit the event etc., I can do 
`require(gasleft() > 15000, "OUT OF GAS")` 
But does that work the same way on Arbitrum? I know gas should not be hardcoded, on Ethereum because of potential changes in gas cost per opcode, but on Arbitrum it would even depend on L1 gas cost, so it's always dynamic?
undefined says Was trying to spin up arbitrum classic (pre-nitro) node  with 32 gb of ram.
1. downloaded and extracted the archival snapshot from : https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
2. spinned up the node pointing the directory to the extracted data directory.
3. Node runs fine for few hours but all of a sudden it crashes, checked the memory (32 gb spcs) usage and it seems it grows linearly upto 85% usage and then dies.

can someone help me out as i'm blocked on this. 
looking forward for response.
undefined says `gasleft()` only accounts for the gas left for the transaction in L2. The gas for L1 is charged with intrinsic gas, not during execution.
So you can do the same you do for L1.
undefined says Hey, a few questions about it:
- Does the node finish verifying the db before it shuts down?
- Can you send some logs and/or any message docker sends when dying? (You can do so on DM if you prefer)
undefined says 1. I am not sure if the db is verified as i always get <last database checkpoint> log line on the console
2. since on the console last log line is always <last database checkpoint> and then the docker container dies with an error code "137" printed at the bottom, on the monitoring page i see 85% of memory uage. (with ram of 32 gb)

this has happened more than twice to me. 
Did multiple restart and increased the ram from 16 to 32 as well.

DM'ed you as well.
undefined says What storage (disk) are you using?
undefined says ^ @akshjainn
undefined says what you are suggesting is to retrieve L1 block numbers from an L2 batch number and then retrieve tx hash using eth_getBlock. the thing is, it is pretty slow to query every L2 blocks (i don't have my own node). i would like to get tx hashes from an L2 batches number (or an L2 hash) directly, is it possible ?
undefined says You might have to increase your RAM, depending on what you're doing. Keep in mind that 32 Gb is the minimum requirement and you can easily need more than that.
undefined says I'm following this tutorial, and I have a question: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging
To my understanding it is possible to create a custom token on L1 and L2 and register them to the custom gateway. It is also possible, to send tokens from L1 to L2 since the L2 token implements the bridgeMint function. However, the L1 token does not have that function, so I can only send L2 tokens to L1 if there are some tokens in the L1 escrow. Is it possible to circumvent this, i.e. to implement an L1 which has bridgeMint, so I can send from L2 -> L1 even if there are no tokens in the L1 escrow?
undefined says Hey guys, I am very new to Arbitrum and have just built a node locally (fully synced). I am trying to find information on the sequencer feed but am unsure how to connect to it or see it. Is there a page on the docs or something I'm missing? I found info on how to read the messages in the from the sequencer feed (similar to geth), but am missing the first part. I also notice when starting my node it does say connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster, then says feed connected  (Any help would be greatly appreciated 🙂

Update:  I made a script that creates a ws connection to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed with header  'Arbitrum-Feed-Client-Version': '2', and this looks like it works. is this listening to my local nodes feed though? im assuming this is a public feed? Am trying to figure out how to connect to my own nodes feed as I assume this is faster/better? or is there no difference?
undefined says Any devs for Arbitrum? Looking to go crosschain from Avalanche.
undefined says Evening gentlemen, would hosting my own arbitrum node reduce the time it takes to use smart contract functions such as balanceOf/transfer or does it all depend on the distance to the sequencer?
undefined says what OS do you recommend?
undefined says Non-mutating calls like balanceOf are faster but mutating txs like transfer are only slightly faster because the gas estimation part is faster; actually submitting the tx isn't any faster
undefined says By default your node already connects to the feed 🙂 If you'd like your node to also host a feed you can look at the `--node.feed.output` set of options (see `--help`). That's useful if you're running a bunch of nodes; you can make only one connection to our feed and then the other nodes can connect to your local feed. You can also run a feed relay without running a node.
undefined says You'd need to create a custom gateway contract for this: https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#other-flavors-of-gateways
undefined says Hey. I'm working for a client that is looking to port across an NFT project from eth. they have a low floor price but a solid community and I've built their staking website and marketplace, but gas fees are going to make it very expensive to use.    Basically i'd be looking to recreate the project on Arbitrum and airdrop each holders NFTs to them on Arb.  Is there anything i need to be aware of or on the look out for that might be a problem?
undefined says We have a list of differences between Arbitrum and L1 Ethereum here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences
undefined says cheers, thanks Lee. I'll take a look.
undefined says Yep I can see that in the node startup logs, but how do I view the feed? I read the port is “Sequencer Feed: 9642”, but if I create a web socket to my own servers IP with that port I get nothing. Is there even any difference between using my own nodes stream compared to the arb1.Arbitrum feed? I’m assuming listening to my own nodes stream should be faster yeah?
undefined says we are on GCP (with SSD persistant disk)
okay.
i hope increasing to 64 Gb will help us .

Thank you.
undefined says hey one more question for this, what would the gasLimit then be? how does that relate to all this? how does arbitrum decide how much gas of the gasLimit is sent to the tx as L2 gas?
undefined says Is there a tutorial for creating a custom gateway and connecting to the bridge? Will I be able to use bridge.arbitrum.io with this custom gateway?
undefined says Hey @José FP | Offchain Labs 
how much approx time does classic node will take to sync if we allocate 64 Gb of Ram.
given that we have download and extracted the snapshot from https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
undefined says Why do I use the official container to prompt this {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":429,"message":"Public RPC Rate Limit Hit, limit will reset in 60 seconds"}}
undefined says I was looking through the gas pricing mechanism on arbitrum. Seems like l2 gas price is orders of magnitude higher on arbitrum compared to optimsim (0.1 vs 0.001 Gwei). What's the reasoning behind it being so high when compared or is that going to change anytime soon?
undefined says I'm syncing a node on AWS and the current pace seems to be around 500k blocks/hr, is this expected? Roughly 3.5 days until finished
undefined says I also have question on sync full node
When I was sync the node, the storage it takes is around 35GB and do not go up. Is this normal? or it should go up but somehow it didnot
undefined says 
undefined says the log is like this but when I check my storage change, it is always around 35GB
undefined says A fully synced node should take much more than that (around 1.2 TB iirc), although I see yours is still syncing.
In any case, if there was some space problem while syncing you would get an error. Are you looking at the right storage?
undefined says I'm not sure about the exact time for fully syncing a node, but 3.5 days sounds about right, iirc.
undefined says You are hitting the rate limit of the Sequencer. Try sending less transactions per second and make sure they are well parametrized (nonce, enough gas, ...)
undefined says I don't know how long it takes, tbh. But please let us know how the process works for you after increasing RAM 👍
undefined says This article explains how gas is calculated in Arbitrum => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

L1 gas is intrinsic gas so it gets deducted before initiating the execution.

Let me know if that article answers your question 👍
undefined says yes I am looking at /FILE/TO/arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata
undefined says will this file keep increasing?
undefined says or there are other folder should I look
undefined says 大哥你的散装英文都快让人看不懂了
undefined says Will the self-built arb nodes also be restricted? What is the frequency of the restriction? Can I cancel this restriction?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hey  Jose. 🤝 
I'm installing a node on my 910GB disk. nitro-recent.tar with 360Gb
 I want to delete the file after the installation is finished. Where is this file kept? I don't think it would be a problem for me to delete it. is it true ?
undefined says After the .tar file is opened, the disk will be 800GB full. storage will not be enough for the rest of the sync. so i have to delete it.
undefined says Can someone help me with arbiscan API ?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/address/0xe726c8007c4f2aeb827d6e7f034a24e0b77beed0
undefined says How can I retreive all the addresses holding this token from python ? x)

40.031.311 block
undefined says that's amzing thank you so much
undefined says hiiiiiii teams, it's better to update this on your docs.
undefined says I have installed, but there are 27 million blocks between me and the current block and the difference does not close. 😦
undefined says ok letme try it
undefined says Hey Erkan, Can you please check which directory it takes? /FILE/TO/arbitrum/arb1/nitro/l2chaindata?
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says is there any chance we can choose which block we want to start sync and get the tar? looks like we only start with genesis block or recent block(40,031,311)? @José FP | Offchain Labs @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs (for example, I want to download tar file for 2023/03/01)
undefined says The snapshot file I shared above is 40.031.331. continues from the block.
undefined says yea I got that. but just wondering if we can start from, lets say, 60,000,000
undefined says I gave you the wrong link. This is the correct one. Sorry 
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says Let's wait for the team to inform us about this.   😊
undefined says thank you, but it looks like the same one
undefined says OK no problem. good luck. 🚀
undefined says Will the RPC nodes built by yourself also be restricted from trading   {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":429,"message":"Public RPC Rate Limit Hit, limit will reset in 60 seconds"}}
undefined says I didn't quite understand what you mean. 😦
undefined says greetings jose,
I am using my Arbitrum node as api connection to another project. Can I still be a validator, test runner in this arbitrum node? For what purpose are users other than me installing this node?
undefined says 
undefined says wait why /var/lib is that big
undefined says I can understand why /root/data/arbitrum is 379GB(because of l2chaindata)
undefined says but why the rest goes to /var/lib instead of /root/data/arbitrum
undefined says I thought the data we need to sync is just l2 chain data right? or there are other files
undefined says can u check what is in /var/lib?
undefined says 
undefined says so this is not the file that node needs?
undefined says looks like it's system config
undefined says Had an archive node crash and accidentally restarted it without the archive flag (and it sync'd for a bit), and once I noticed, restarted it again _with_ the flag.  However, seeing these errors everywhere: "Error: Returned error: missing trie node f202b63fd901517bedfb5ce5e9e6b2853aca3bd178c61a8eebb86ddd73831db7 (path ) <nil>".  I assume those were nodes that were sync'd while the archive flag was off.  Is there any way to get it to sync those properly, or do I need to completely re-sync the node from scratch?
undefined says You might need to resync it
undefined says Hey Jason, I have some questions above and it will be nice if you can tell me about it:arbjak:
undefined says You can still be watchTower validator while running your fullnode. Others people run fullnode may use them to verify the chain data themselves like cex, but mostly are using it as node api.
undefined says Sorry, we don’t provide that service, but we have a recent tar file: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says if I want to start from block 2000000, can I just download the recent tar file and delete some data in l2chaindata to achieve that? then running the docker command will automatically sync without error right? or it will not work, because of triecache or sth else?
undefined says Any chance there's a recent archive node snapshot somewhere?  Downloading 1.9tb again because of missing a flag for a handful of blocks is rough...  Or anyway to re-sync from the start, but with already existing downloaded data?  Seems like I'd have all the blocks locally already and should be able to just replay them in order to build the correct states along the way, rather than downloading all of that again?
undefined says By The Way
Can you tell which DEX currently supports Abritrum Testnet so we can check our Contracts are compatible with DEXes or not Before Deploying it on MainNet?
undefined says I won’t suggest that, because you might make the database crash.
undefined says Oh, we don’t provide recent archive database snapshot. As far as I know, geth also doesn’t support this.
undefined says Alrighty, back to a few days of downloading data 🙂
undefined says ic, so best way is to sync from the genesis block right? is there any faster way other then using recent tar file?
undefined says https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/pull/5457 this is merged and should be alive soon
undefined says [suggestion] Might be worth adding a warning/flag somewhere with a "This looks like an archive node, but no --node.caching.archive set, make sure you want that" type of note.  Sucks to have a node irreversibly destroyed after missing a single flag for a second.
undefined says ^ Likely would save you guys a ton of bandwidth too, not having to re-seed nodes 🙂
undefined says Oh can't wait for it
undefined says May I ask why you just wanna a specific block number chain database?
undefined says Sure, thanks for your suggestion.
undefined says is there only one sequencer right now ?
undefined says I am curious about what files are changed and how those files update. Trying to dive deep into the structure of Arbitrum because I think this is very fascinating. 

the reason for getting a specific block number chain database is because I am doing some zk-related stuff on arbitrum and the transition between two block is one topic that I need to know. (sorry for not able to tell more about the motivation)
undefined says I want to delete the leftovers from the .tar file I downloaded. I'm out of space on my disk. where are these tar file residues kept. root/data/arbitrum/ Is it in the file?  I don't want to corrupt database with wrong application

@Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Cool, the execution part we use geth to do, you can also see our forked go-ethereum: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum
undefined says I don’t know which dictionary you mount to docker, you should find it first, and then others file outside that dictionary you can download.
undefined says thanks! so is there anyway I can achieve the goal(sync from certain block)?
undefined says I don’t think we provide ways to do this.
undefined says got it
undefined says Hey! So I have a running archival arbitrum node. Now I also want to run full node. Can I copy data of archival node and give it to full node? Would it automatically decrease the size of the data? Thanks!
undefined says Sorry, found we already have this, you can try it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1455/files
undefined says Hello:)
Can someone explain, why is it necessary to use 3Tb storage for archive node (as it's said in requirements)? Currently node uses only 200Gb, and it seems like 500 will be enough for a while, several weeks at least.
undefined says You could also use `--node.dangerous.reorg-to-block=...`
undefined says In theory it could be pruned, but pruning support isn't merged yet and also it'd probably end up being a significantly larger database than a normal full node (depending on how much memory you have to prune with)
undefined says Are you syncing archive node or fullnode?
undefined says How can I check mode? I thought it was archive, but now I'm not sure:) I can get transactions' receipts - is it possible for both modes?
undefined says Do you have your node start command?
undefined says ```docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.10-73224e3 --l1.url <node_url> --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*```
undefined says Like this, but with proper path
undefined says Your node is not archive node
undefined says You should add `--node.caching.archive`
undefined says Oh, and what is the main difference between them? And what about space needed for fullnode? Why 1.2Tb?
undefined says https://www.quicknode.com/guides/infrastructure/node-setup/ethereum-full-node-vs-archive-node/#what-is-an-ethereum-full-node
undefined says My bad, connected two questions in one:) I use remote l1, so no need in storage for ethereum node. Are storage requirements based on Ethereum and Arbitrum node running on same machine?
undefined says That requirement is just for arbitrum node itself.
undefined says But now it's just 200Gb used, why additional 1 Tb?
undefined says Hey! For running a full node of arbitrum, can i use l1 url of full ethereum node? Or url of archival node is needed? Thanks!
undefined says L1 fullnode is ok
undefined says You should still be syncing
undefined says I deployed token ERC-20 to arbitrum testnet Goreli so good but when I deploy another contract I got error "Error HH110: Invalid JSON-RPC response received: {"error":"Request dropped Cause: Request was dropped"}". I try deploy another network it still ok but just Arbitrum got error "Error HH110: Invalid JSON-RPC response received: {"error":"Request dropped Cause: Request was dropped"}"
undefined says How can I check this? In logs I see "created block" with proper current time, also I can get block info and transaction receipt for randomly chosen block (checked 1, 100, 100000 and some other).
undefined says This might due to network overload, you could try it later.
undefined says I try two day but not completed and I try deploy ERC-20 contract work well, I think it is not problem about network overload
undefined says Which rpc you are using? And how do you use that? From your wallet or use code?
undefined says You can send `eth_syncing` to your node, and see if return is false which mean it is not syncing, if it shows block number it means your node is syncing.
undefined says Returned false, yes. So can I downgrade storage from 3Tb to 0.5-0.7Tb, what do you think?
undefined says I use rpc: https://endpoints.omniatech.io/v1/arbitrum/goerli/public and currently I use hardhat for deploy it, It work well with ERC-20 contract
undefined says You can downgrade it to 1 tb, not too low is because you need to sync future state.
undefined says You can try others rpc and can you make sure you tx is correct? (Such as account Nonce )
undefined says Oh, I change to another rpc I see it works well. Thanks
undefined says Why do I use the official container to prompt this {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":429,"message":"Public RPC Rate Limit Hit, limit will reset in 60 seconds"}}
undefined says Hello! Does anyone know what this 'Topic' means: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xffae9851d5c3520ca6921f75a480915c82ac3ea01be1c7d04a2e135d056dfa01#eventlog

undefined says Hey! I have a question:

If I send a payload to a smart contract deployed on arbitrum (let’s say an object). How long will it take to get written on chain and verified until another entity could read the data?
undefined says I started with this code. I think the ''/root/data/arbitrum/ '' folder is the working data. is it true. which one should i delete?

docker run -d -v ~/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.7-10b845c --l1.url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxxxxxxxxx   --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar"
undefined says can someone help with this?
undefined says why i have this? someone?
undefined says do i have to download manually the db and host it locally to my node so i do not get this error?
undefined says There is a .tar file in my message above. this file is 40.031.311  continues on the block. but I recommend at least 900GB disk. I also close the difference of 1 million blocks a day with 42Gb ram.
undefined says you think ram is the problem here? i have 4tb raid so not a problem with the disk
undefined says full sync seems to take 20 days
undefined says did not understand.. how do i do that?
undefined says He's a scammer, ignore him
undefined says I don't know dude. I don't want to give wrong information. but you can try stopping and restarting docker.
undefined says yeah saw that... thank you.. ok i am running the arbitrtum node for a 10 days now.. i guess it will sync in the next 10 days haha.. will try to restart it and than init with the tar file downloaded i will post what i have done and if this problem continues. thank you again
undefined says It’s EVM format to organize logs. Read more about it here:

https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378
undefined says Looks like database compacting might have taken 23 seconds, you might want to use faster drive
undefined says Wow.. i use raid 5, 6 sas drives and still not fast enough? 🙄🤔
undefined says Please
undefined says Interesting, thank you @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs !
undefined says is there a way to connect to an arb node using ipc ?
undefined says just like one can connect to a geth ethereum node using geth.ipc
undefined says yep `--ipc.path` , you just might need to bind mount it out of docker if you're using docker
undefined says I am not talking about connecting an arb node to a mainnet node right ?
undefined says I am talking about connecting my web3js code to my arb node
undefined says yeah use the `--ipc.path` option on your arb node
undefined says it'll create an IPC at that path
undefined says ah ok ok, let me try
undefined says ty !
undefined says it looks like this is trying to create a dir ?
undefined says IPC opening failed                       url=/data/.arbitrum error="mkdir /data: permission denied"
undefined says wherever you set the path to it'll try to create an IPC file
undefined says 
undefined says @lockesmith my guess is you didn't configure your docker volume correctly, so the db was ephemeral and now gone
undefined says I tried updating the error to add more info but the bot got me... The docker config should be fine. The node has been running for a few months and has made it past plenty of restarts and upgrades.
undefined says I get "Found legacy ancient chain path, opened ancient database, allocated cache, found legacy ancient chain path, opened ancient database, then error initializing database"
undefined says I'd double check the volume setup
undefined says That doesn't make sense. It can find the ancient database exactly where it should be on the mounted volume.
undefined says so I set a path that is permissionned (777) but I still get an error 'mkdir permission denied'
undefined says There isn’t an easy answer to your question, because it depends on lots of things like:
1. Your node connection (bandwidth and distance from sequencer)
2. Network congestion
3. The other node connection (the node that you wanna listen to result)
Etc
undefined says I basically don't get the 'mkdir' part of the error @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs
undefined says It's trying to create the ipc inside the docker container, not outside. Use a volume bind mount (-v) to mount /data inside the container to somewhere outside the container
undefined says No it created the ancient dir. Check the db size inside the container with docker exec
undefined says oke
undefined says looks it only take 384gb, and this data is not large, you can see others data outside that dir and delete those you thought not important.
undefined says Sounds good. I understand. Would you say it’s more than a couple of seconds?
undefined says hey guys, I'm relatively new to arbitrum (but not solidity). I have a simply ERC721 contract but the mint function needs an insane amount of gas in testnet:
https://goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0xc09e9a6715a6debab67a0be6a6c2ba0577d2d4ce0e63a356b0a7624af0e36179
and this one is even worse:
https://goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0xd60b1b3f4111415de32bbfa72d0942b8264a56fb79e9762cde38d91d92fc0ef9

Anyones guess why this is so high? I'm talking about the used gas metric, not the actually paid gas price or so.
undefined says how come gas usage is x7 with exactly the same transaction a few hours later?
undefined says I am facing this problem is there any solution
undefined says It looks like you don't have space left in your disk.
undefined says Gas in Arbitrum has 2 components: L1 gas and L2 gas. You can read more about it here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

In your transactions, most of the gas used goes to the L1 part (there's now a new tab in the transaction view of arbiscan that splits the gas into L1 and L2, here's the link to that tab for your first transaction: https://goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0xc09e9a6715a6debab67a0be6a6c2ba0577d2d4ce0e63a356b0a7624af0e36179#txninfo )

And the reason why it's so high is because L1 Goerli is very congested these days.
undefined says thanks, I sort-of caught up reading through some of the docs. I was wondering what the reason for this spike is though, l1 goerli being congested makes sense - thanks a bunch!
undefined says are there any examples of estimating L1 gas through javascript with metamask/web3.js? I'll implement that to properly assign gas for these transactions
undefined says congestion can happen anytime, anynet so it makes sense to build it like that
undefined says We don't have examples right now (we are working on them, though), but you can query the precompile `ArbGasInfo`, and use its function `getPricesInWei()` to get the current estimation of gas prices. In your case, for the L1 calldata price, you would need the second result of that function.
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006c#readContract#F15

Keep in mind that you must multiply that price by the number of bytes in the data of your function to get the actual L1 cost of your transaction.

If this is tricky to understand, that article I linked above explains where the formula comes from 🙂

Hope that helps!
undefined says I think I am getting the hang of it, thanks! 🙂
undefined says where to find more info about rate limiting when running node locally?
undefined says @ArmutBey ^

undefined says sorry to insist but I am really struggling with docker... right now I already have a bind mount to run the node (-v /data/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum) should I create a 2nd bind mount ?
undefined says I couldn't find a document about this
undefined says finally figured out what to do, thanks for your help mate, really appreciate it !
undefined says Yes you will want to have more capacity than that in your disk. As per the current requirements, you need a minimum of 1.2 TB of disk, but keep in mind that you'll need more as time passes: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says If you're running one node, the only rate limit you'll encounter is the Sequencer rate limit for transactions your node sends.
I'm not sure about the exact current limit, but keep in mind that it might change in the future.
undefined says I don't understand how my nft is there, someone explain to me how it went to the contract because I didn't send it, is there any way to get it back?
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc0136c489b35a5cd990df1206f79f31397fdaf41ae2a68e41050cb72feffc5eb
undefined says Nft odyssey
undefined says Hey, to clarify more, is the `from address` in this transaction yours?
undefined says 0x4069cf66d928706306a9817dc78eb3126ac6343f 

This is mine but I do not carry out such a transaction
undefined says I got some gas and she went there alone
undefined says I bought the nft more than 100 days ago, it doesn't make sense to send it and more to the contract
undefined says The token was not sent to the contract ser, it was transferred to another address (https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa4eCAf57F2eDb96e0eC63253C4533dAD75c5C97B)
which you might recognize as I can see some ETH was transferred from that account to yours just before the NFT transfer:
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xf017e50f74069043e9329893614af362c8f9ae69c421f191d826e93e4989a5a0
undefined says Well, I don't really recognize it. Do you think my wallet is compromised?
undefined says Is there a way to block that nft I'll stop using this wallet now I see clearly that they have taken it from me and therefore someone has my keys
undefined says I'm not really sure but yes that's totally possible. The nft was already sent to the other address so you cannot take it back.
undefined says Running a nitro node and getting this error repeating over and over. "Block not found." I am using an Erigon node for L1.

undefined says Trying to run arbitrum and have it connect to my pokt node to relay but can't get it to sync it appears because this error 'block not found'.
undefined says Hey,  this is almost certainly an L1 issue. Most probably your L1 node isnt synced
undefined says Also, note that Erigon v2.34.0 was broken and it was fixed in https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/releases/tag/v2.35.1
undefined says Thanks I'll check it out. I had updated erigon to 2.40 last night but I see they released another update 2.41 6 hours ago. They should keep the fixes in the latest versions I presume.
undefined says 
undefined says hmm I did not send a duplicate. So here it is again. Curling erigon shows it is synced ahead of latest block. There's no indication it is behind.
undefined says I noticed this in erigon along with the block not found 15500002

[snapshots] retire blocks                err="DumpBlocks: DumpHeaders: header missed in db: block_num=15500000,
undefined says Maybe I should check my consensus layer to see if it needs updating.
undefined says Yeah that might solve the issue
undefined says CL is fine. I just deleted the snapshots dir and it's downloading again. We'll see if that helps. Thanks.
undefined says Great, Hope it works! Keep us posted ser! :arbiblobblue:
undefined says tried to connect to wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed, but got 400 Bad Request. Can someone verify that the sequencer feed is functional?
undefined says anybody familiar with this error
undefined says im `connected to L1 chain` trying to persist data like so 
`        volumes:
            - '/home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data/:/arbitrum-node/data/'    

       - --persistent.chain=/arbitrum-node/data/`
undefined says May I ask why you want to connect this? This is used by fullnode to get feed information of tx sequence.
undefined says It seems you don’t have write permission on your /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/Node.sol Which part of node here refers? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says I added permissions to the folder `/data` and all subfolders
then I get the same error but with LOCK added like so
undefined says also added `user: 1000:1000` to the docker-compose.yml
undefined says How do you give permission?
undefined says `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /data`
undefined says This is rblock: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#rules-for-confirming-or-rejecting-rblocks
undefined says You'll need to give it permission through docker cli inputs
undefined says ```docker exec -u root -t -i container_id```
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#note-on-permissions , and seems you should give permission to `/home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data` rather than `data`
undefined says I did this, basically the entire folder `/home/$USER/arbitrum-node` and all subfolders
they shouldn't have been permissioned at least I didnt create them so
undefined says not familiar with this, just in the terminal?
undefined says Add the first commands before the command you used to run Nitro container
undefined says ```-u root ```
undefined says using docker compose 
should I just be running under root user `sudo -i` from the start
undefined says Can you show me the command you used to run nitro
undefined says 
undefined says rip, pastebin maybe?
undefined says eh getting duplicated text warning
undefined says yeah give me a second
undefined says https://pastebin.com/gAkPBiw9
undefined says i meant the bashcommand, ```docker-compose ....```
undefined says just from the working directory 
`docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f nitro-node`
undefined says Ok
undefined says maybe without the hyphen
undefined says 1 sec
undefined says yea that tutorial was outdated afaik
undefined says use this instead https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says I missed this step https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#note-on-permissions
undefined says theres this run command 
`docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url https://l1-node:8545 --l2.chain-id=<L2ChainId> --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*`
but trying to get a docker compose script for it, where does the data persist is there not a additional flag for this
undefined says try this maybe
```docker run -u root --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8567 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8568 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --l2.chain-id=42170 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.1 --http.vhosts=*```
undefined says lol i didn't add that and now my node has been running for like 2 weeks without it
undefined says - --persistent.chain=/arbitrum-node/data/
        - --persistent.global-config=/arbitrum-node/
just  add those commands at the end
undefined says thanks will try
undefined says If the L2 message has A,B. A is packaged by the sequencer, B is not packaged by the sequencer but goes to the delayed inbox, so what is the order of A and B?
undefined says It depends on when sequencer include those delayed inbox message or when the user force include it. But if they send tx at the same time, the tx A will always be the first because sequencer can give the instant confirm.
undefined says How many arbitrum blocks are usually created per second?
I am curious about the block creation speed.
I want to estimate how much time has passed according to the block number creation rate, and I want to know the approximate creation rate.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Jason im having issues launching my token in Arbitrum Testnet Goerli network. Any idea what might be the issue when this happens:
creation of XX errored: Returned error: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":"[ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{"value":{"code":-32603,"data":{"error":"Request dropped Cause: Request was dropped"}}}'","id":8111882457060670}
undefined says im getting crazy, already launched it in normal Goerli and it works flawlessly but not in goerli arbitrum
undefined says Is there a specific case of interactive fraud proof? The example of alice is still too abstract.
undefined says The mini creation time is 0.25s/block, but when tx number not so much it will higher than this, note that arbitrum doesn’t have fixed block time so it hard to compute an average block time. (Daily tx are various every day)
undefined says Are you using https://endpoints.omniatech.io/v1/arbitrum/goerli/public rpc? You can change to another rpc will work.
undefined says According to the description, each step instruction is updated to VM state as a leaf node, right？
undefined says Hey! what is a reasonable block offset so we don't need to handle rollbacks on arbitrum? We have 10 for ethereum mainnet for example because it never rollsback more than 10 blocks
undefined says {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":429,"message":"Public RPC Rate Limit Hit, limit will reset in 60 seconds"}}   He came back to this and I wonder if it's my problem or everyone's problem
undefined says We have a rate limit on our public rpc, you can use 3rd party rpc if you need a high requests number.
undefined says how do I build bridgegen and precompilesgen?
undefined says ```
../util/contracts/batch_poster_verifier.go:13:2: no required module provides package github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/bridgegen; to add it:
        go get github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/bridgegen```
undefined says Let me try
undefined says Tks brother
undefined says Is there a reason I am unable to call function contracts using both infura and alchemy nodes?
undefined says doing research into arbitrum and wanted to see simulate the live sequencer feed. is there anyway for to connect to this websocket wo running a full node? dont currently have the capacity to
undefined says How i can calculate what affects the gas used for L1? 

Through the docs referring to "L1 Pricing"(https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-pricing#l1-fee-collection) i've read: "The total fee charged to a transaction is the product of the transaction's estimated size, and the current L1 Gas Basefee. The estimated size is measured in L1 gas and is calculated as follows: first, compress the transaction's data using the brotli-zero algorithm, then multiply the size of the result by 16." 

How i can reproduce this steps to see if result correspond to gasUsedForL1 field in tx receipt?
undefined says I'm testing the difference in cost to deploying a contract to L1 (ganache) and to L2 (Arbitrum local dev node). When i deploy my contract to ganache the gas used is 6,364,395 but in Arbitrum local is 67,557,010 (Gas Used For L1 : 61,183,515 | 90.57%, Gas Used For L2: 6,373,495 | 9.43%)

1. is 61M a reasonable value for gas used for L1? (Maybe my contract is too complex and not optimised) 
2. Gas used for deployment in ganache, shouldn't be the same to gas used for L2? (I suppose these gases are only for the EVM computation needed for deployment of my contract)
undefined says how much GB is a good sync of the arb network per day? mine goes 6-7gb a day.. is that good? i am on block 44,212,000 and counting.. is that a good performance? or must be faster?
undefined says has anyone been able to run ./build-brotli.sh -w? I'm getting 
```emcc: error: arm64: No such file or directory ("arm64" was expected to be an input file, based on the commandline arguments provided)```
undefined says Add -d
undefined says any current stats on how expensive contract deployment is on arbitrum one? I know, depends on so many things, but does anyone have any transactions handy of recent deployments?
undefined says having the same issue, its really frustrating
undefined says I got the permissions sorted it was simply this here https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#note-on-permissions
undefined says does arbitrum nodes store the full L2 blocks or just the header?
undefined says We have code here may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/osp/OneStepProofEntry.sol#L34
undefined says Hey, it’s better not to use fixed block number to check, you can use safe flag in rpc to check or call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L71, here we have an example: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/l1-confirmation-checker
undefined says What errors you got?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says The gas cost for l1 part is various when l1 gas is different, so I don’t think use local dev node to test that is a good idea, you’d better use `eth_estimateGas` on l1 directly to test, but it will also be different when l1 gas price changes. The cost on execution different might because you use optimizer or you use some opcode that cost different between arbitrum and ethereum (may because ethereum has hard fork to upgrade those opcode or use some arbitrum specific type)
undefined says It’s good
undefined says It’s depends on you want to run normal fullnode or archive node.
undefined says Gotcha
undefined says Is there any way to get the root hash of a Merkle tree of all L2 to L1 messages in the chain’s history？ @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Sure, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L30 or query https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L74
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L30 In the mapping here, the key refers to the current hash of merkle tree, and the value refers to L2 Block Hash？
undefined says If you want to get the latest confirmed root, you should query that event I sent to you and find it on the latest event emitted, and yup, the value is l2 block hash, you can see how to set this here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L269, from https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol#L114.
undefined says * @param blockHash The block hash at the end of the assertion
     * @param sendRoot The send root at the end of the assertion
undefined says what is the current block gas limit on Arbitrum?  Is it 32m or 70m?
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs How big is arbitrum testnet(goerli) archive node? In what size should I make volume with to run a arbitrum goerli archive node?
undefined says 32m
undefined says Thanks.  Only slightly more than Eth mainnet 30m?  How can the base gas price be so low when Arbitrum has more txns than mainnet?  shouldn't EIP 1559 push up the price comparable to on mainnet?
undefined says so may i know where the data persist in ?
undefined says we print up to 4 blocks per second, so we do 48 blocks in the time mainnet does 1
undefined says Goerli archive node is currently ~289GB. Sizing depends on if you can easily expand your volumes. Plan on it increasing roughly 15GB a week at current usage.
undefined says Yes, the mapped key is the root hash of the current merkle tree, and the value is the block hash of the last L2 block in RBlock. According to the white paper, the inclusion proof can be made by constructing the proof. What can this inclusion proof prove? Is the L2 block in the entire merkle tree?
undefined says You can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L44 to get the proof and send it to outbox to execute your l2-to-l1 tx.
undefined says I had these additional flags included
`- --persistent.chain=/arbitrum-node/data/
- --persistent.global-config=/arbitrum-node/`
I made a folder `arbitrum-node` as my working folder and gave it permissions with `chmod -fR 777 arbitrum-node`
undefined says thanks !
undefined says one more question about to talk to erc20 rpc node. when i enable ubuntu firewall (ufw) it wasn't able to talk to my etherium node, while when i disable ufw it works pretty fine. anyone know which part it did it wrongly please?
undefined says With Alchemy I get the following error
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='arb-mainnet.g.alchemyapi.io', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v2/<APIKEY> (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000001C16F3C8CA0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed'))
undefined says with infura I get a 403 error
 raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://arbitrum-mainnet.infura.io/v3/<APIKEY>
undefined says both keys work for other chains (ETH, AVAX) so it not a problem with the keys
undefined says It depends on your node configuration (both Arbitrum and Ethereum) and how you have your firewall configured. Keep in mind that there's a specific port for receiving RPC requests (8545 for ethereum, 8547 for arbitrum).
undefined says ^ @BohemiaLai
undefined says I am able to use these nodes for every other chain but not ARB.  I am following the documentation on infura and alchemy for node set up i dont tihnk thats where the problem is
undefined says Alchemy uses different keys for different networks, iirc. In any case, being a connection issue with their nodes, it might be worth asking in their Discord.
Same goes for Infura, although they use the same key for all networks, iirc. I think in the past they've had some Authentication issues depending on the configuration used, so it might be better to ask in their server too.
undefined says hey guys, Do you know how long it will take for a transaction to bridge from Layer 2 to Layer 1?
undefined says on testnet
undefined says Can you share the code on how to update it.   thn
undefined says thanks @José FP | Offchain Labs . in my trial when i disable the ufw firewall on my ubuntu OS for Arbi node, it works perfectly fine with my L1 node. So i guess its the problem my Arbi node setup. Is there any port i need to open so as to talk properly with the L1 node ?
undefined says docker run -d -v ~/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.12-alpha.7-5834021 --l1.url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar"
undefined says It should take around 7 days, as in mainnet.
undefined says What is behind the firewall? L1 node, L2 node or both?
You can share your network architecture on DM if you feel more comfortable.
undefined says I'm trying to gather more information about this but, in the meanwhile, is there any specific reason why you're running the alpha version of the node and not the latest stable version? `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec`
undefined says Actually, it looks like that message was added only in v2.0.7, are you sure you're running the latest stable version?
undefined says After running nitro node locally, can I get the sendRoot in L2 Block from it?
undefined says If I want to open the rpc to an external pc, which config should I adjust please?
undefined says Yup, your own rpc node will also return this.
undefined says You should follow the guide we provide in our docs and also open your server’s port to public (firewall settings)
undefined says Sorry which doc I should refer to? Probably I missed that
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Is --http.addr the only config that I need to modify? Thanks :arbifrog:
undefined says No need to reset that, use 0.0.0.0
undefined says thanks Jason. so any particular config i need to modify other than open the port to public ?
undefined says Yup, and make sure your IP address is not dynamic ip.
undefined says What commnad to rerun docker after stop it ?
undefined says re-run your previous command is ok
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed Can I get similar information through rpc?
undefined says You mean from public rpc or 3rd party rpc? Nop you can’t, you can only get this by running your own node or relay.
undefined says Why the Bisect is needed when solving disputes? Can the challenger indicate the disputable transaction directly?
undefined says Can someone assist me with this simple question? 
I am working with pre-nitro data and I found that there are deposits that have a transaction fee (and effectively change the balance of the receiver address) that I cannot detect with RPC. The traces are empty and the transactions do not indicate this fee. How can I obtain the missing value?
Here are some examples:
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xd74a0d49bef9030dab5fa6353af080d7f09131f7a61f869b4602bf672c8b62f4
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa5b26a24dc071b18f631f3218ddbc9ce6aed8f70b430fa457f9fbe65fbf57081
Thank you very much!
undefined says The challenger won't know the disputable transaction at the beginning of the challenge because it is only aware of the state root of the blockchain after processing N transactions.
Then, both parties start bisecting until they reach a point where a single transaction produces a different state for them. After that, they'll bisect until a single computation step produces a different result for them.
And that's the step that is executed on L1.
(The whole challenge is managed on L1, but only the last step is executed there)
You can read more about it here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/proving/challenge-manager
undefined says While I take a look at this, one question: are you querying a classic (pre-nitro) node?

undefined says just DMed
undefined says I'm querying a nitro node, using the methods arbtrace_... for traces (https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum/arbtrace_block).
undefined says Thanks, answered on DM
undefined says `arbtrace_ `calls should be sent to a classic node. Some node providers do forward those calls from nitro to their classic nodes, but if you're calling your own nitro node, be aware of this behaviour.
undefined says Yes, we're using a node provider and we're getting the correct trace responses for all the pre-nitro transactions except for deposits or, more generally, when there is a tx from the null address to Arbitrum: ArbRetryableTx.
For example, requesting traces for this tx 0x32223c58ec797af4d68ac1ba96ff8fb3abd828a81efc6a669b67d879624752fe returns no results: {‘jsonrpc’: ‘2.0’, ‘id’: 0, ‘result’: None}
undefined says has anyone figured out how to *locally* run the L2 nitro node in conjunction with anvil?

looking to test some cross-chain messaging stuff, but my L1 contract depends on Curve & existing tokens. was thinking of running anvil as a mainnet fork that can also communicate with a local L2 nitro node
undefined says another option is -- do the local dev nodes (from the arbitrum docs) support mainnet forking?
undefined says I want to be able to run rcp calls without paying for a third party service like Infura for simple transactions on uniswap. How can I do it?
undefined says you can run your own node, or use a public RPC. ankr has a free RPC that's half decent, dont want to post the link but its easy to search for

edit: running your own node is likely to be more costly than a node provider (alchemy / infura / ankr / etc)

llamanodes will prob have an arbitrum RPC within a few weeks i imagine
undefined says Thanks. I like learning so prefer to run my own node. Do you know of any good step by step walkthroughs on how to do it? (This will be my first time running any node$
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Do I need to run a full ethereum node to run an Arbitrum node?
undefined says Any idea why the following is happening? Trying to send a transaction, but no matter what nonce I send, I get completely different results...  Looking at transactions, the last nonce used was 129266, so the first send here _should_ be correct.  But I get back a "too low".  Increasing by 1 tells me I'm still too low, with a new nonce.  Increasing again and I get told the nonce should be the one I originally sent...
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"nonce too low: address 0xxxx, tx: 129267 state: 129268"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"nonce too low: address 0xxxx, tx: 129268 state: 129269"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"nonce too high: address 0xxxx, tx: 129269 state: 129267"}}
undefined says yes i upgraded to 2.0.12. I have no problem now. thanks
undefined says Can I follow this for Goerli?
undefined says And I assume I need to run a goerli node?
undefined says How to change the default RPC port (8547)
undefined says you don't need to, but I've been hitting resource limits using infura (only for testing) so would recommend using your own
undefined says and forceInclusion block time and number will be the 24 hour old block time and number from L1 in which it was submitted to the delayedInbox? or is it from the force inclusion time?
undefined says 
undefined says running a watch tower node, that only executes l2 txns posted to l1 right? it doesn't assume an honest sequencer right?

if the sequencer fails to post batches to L1, when the sequencer resumes posting to mainnet, it will try its best within the timeboundary to set block times and numbers as promised in the soft confirmation, but any txns older than 24 hours will be clamped to a timestamp as of 24 hours in the past?

when the sequencer resumes, it probably can't post all outstanding txns since that would be more arbgas / unit time than the speed limit.
undefined says what happens when arbitrum is running near its speed limit? in that case, do nodes continue executing txns as if the sequencer gave a soft guarantee, but no assertions are made or challenged except for txns in batches with L1 finality?

if arbitrum is running near its speed limit, what happens if the sequencer infra fails or has a bug and goes offline completely? then the chain is paused for 24 hours until users can force include txns.
undefined says Greetings. What is the easiest way to get ERC721 assets from goerli to arb-goerli?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nft-bridge-workshop-demo

this should be helpful if you want to write a gateway nft wrapper around the native arbitrum bridge. idk about existing solutions
undefined says probably, not sure what the exact steps are to configure for goerli
undefined says thanks
undefined says Thanks.
undefined says do you happen to know the seed db url ? can't figure it out by replacing mainnet w/ goerli, devnet, testnet, etc. cc @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says or "Other chains do not have classic blocks, and do not require an initial genesis database" means I skip it? will find out shortly
undefined says 
undefined says Anybody help with this, the data is not getting persisted where I want it too (if not at all)

Have these lines in my compose.yml
undefined says Left is the Docker container file system:
Data is under `/dev/sda2/` and mounted on `/arbitrum-node/data`
Right is the actual folder, `/home/glc/arbitrum-node/data` which is empty
undefined says 
undefined says how can one check the latency of a node against the sequencer ?
undefined says I have a question if someone can please help me :) I have ethereum in my coinbase wallet not coinbase itself. I try to swap from ethereum mainet to arbitrum and keep getting this error (invalid hash (argument="value", value=undefined, code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=providers/5.7.0) can anyone help me understand how to fix this?
undefined says You are right, there is no seed db required for goerli
undefined says Only mainnet needs seed db, others chain does not, this is because nova and goerli use nitro stack from it genesis, while one genesis at classic tech and upgraded to nitro last year.
undefined says No need, free 3rd party l1 rpc can cover the usage
undefined says This might because your fullnode sync latency, you can wait for some time and then try send it again.
undefined says Sure, and you should provide a l1 rpc node. (You can use 3rd party’s service)
undefined says Do you use docker to run your node? If so, you can change the mapping port in command `-p`
undefined says Watchtower node will verify the rBlock, and when we create rBlock, we will make sure the rBlock has the same tx acc as l1 inbox (we check it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L573), so back to your question, it only verify those tx posted on l1. And because we have multi validators, so if one validator fails to create rblock, there still is another one to create.
undefined says Hey, the data on the container should persist in `--persistent.global-config` (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/cmd/conf/database.go#L41), so you the docker mount point should be `/arbitrum-node`, and I suggest you don’t set `persistent.chain`, it will default to `arb1` if you are running mainnet.
undefined says Which bridge you are using?
undefined says This is on a node thats non-archive.  And tested pulling the nonce from both my local node, as well as direct from the arbitrum rpc.  I suspected the same thing that it was latency related, but both the local node, and the arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc were giving the same results.
undefined says It’s weird, does it resume now?
undefined says Yeah, it was a temporary thing that happened sporadically when I posted that message.  Lasted about 20min, then came back on and off for a minute or two at a time over the next 30min, and hasn't been back since
undefined says Was super weird when it happened however.
undefined says It should latency related. (Especially when our sequencer is busy)
undefined says It definitely looked busy (judging by the fullness of blocks), but I was definitely seeing incorrect results for 15+ minutes
undefined says Hey all
undefined says Am on the look out for Arbitrum one projects to list on a DEX at the moment
undefined says DEX is multichain but MVP deployed on Arbitrum One
undefined says You can find a list of projects deployed on Arbitrum One in our portal => https://portal.arbitrum.one/
undefined says Hey @José FP | Offchain Labs we are looking to help run some nodes and RPC endpoints for foundation. Spoke with team briefly in Denver. Is there a specific person I can set up an intro call with to discuss this more in depth?
undefined says I have 2 identical transaction with wildy different gas usage, the calldata is the same and the L2 gas is the same for both tx, but for one the L1 gas cost is much higher. Why is that? How is that calculated? I though it depended only on the calldata length
undefined says oh, does that depend on the L1 gas fee?
undefined says Sure! You can drop an e-mail to partnerships@offchainlabs.com and explain what your project is about and what you need help with 💪
undefined says Exactly. Calldata is posted compressed and in batches on L1, so part of the tx fees go to cover that action. You can read more about it here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says I have some somewhat basic technical questions about arbitrum—is this the place to ask them or should I use support?
undefined says You can ask technical questions here
undefined says great
undefined says I am trying to get trace data on early blocks, but the node tells me `legacy block numbers are not supported with debug_`. Is there some known cutoff before which I cannot call that endpoint?
undefined says and a related question is: how should I retrieve internal transactions for early arbitrum blocks?
undefined says hei
undefined says You might be trying to query pre-nitro blocks (blocks before 22207818). Those blocks use parity style debug calls, so you would need arbtrace_* calls.
If that's not the case, please let us know.
undefined says do you know of documentation on this?
undefined says it's `arbtrace_*` instead of the normal `trace_*`?
undefined says it's arbtrace_* . You can find info on [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/docs/arbitrum/arbtrace_replayTransaction) docs or take a look at our [code](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/43e78dfbcee794e5a740a68dcf049c3a3fe3aea2/arbnode/api.go#L372).
undefined says bump 🙏
undefined says Has anyone managed to connect Arbitrum node to local Ethereum Erigon node (running private API)?
undefined says We are about to deploy a big Defi platform to arbitrum, but I need one info that's not really easy to find: what is the expected block time in both arbitrum and arbitrum goerli networks?
undefined says Yup we tested it before. Any issue on your side?
undefined says Yeah, I can't seem to pass the jwt.auth / jwt.hex?
undefined says this says to call arbtrace for <22207815 and debug_trace for >=22207818. What should I do about 22207817, 22207816, and 22207815?
undefined says There isn’t a fixed block time like Ethereum here. We have just min block production time period which is 250 ms for now. Other than that our sequencer creates blocks as it receives txs and based on the congestion and some other criteria it can put more than one tx on a block
undefined says So how do I calculate the "elapsed time" on arbitrum? I cannot use block.timestamp and I cannot use block.number? My case is: I need expected blocks per year to calculate interest rate.
undefined says You can use both, block.number returns L1 block number and time stamp returns current timestamp updated by our sequencer . There are some considerations but for a year period that’s find
More info here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/time
undefined says and arbitrum-goerli works the same, right?
undefined says ok I see now, thats pretty smart
undefined says This channel is so helpful. Really appreciate it!
undefined says Yup same
undefined says hey @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs was curious if you knew the answer to this—there seems to be a gap where you cannot trace blocks with either method
undefined says thanks, sent an e-mail. is there anyone on the internal team that deals with RPC infra for projects building on Arbitrum or these types of inquiries that i can forward the info to or contact on discord directly in meantime?
undefined says Any tips on passing the jwt.hex
undefined says Is there a way to run a validator in the local devnet? I would be curious to see how the fraud proof mechanism works. I tried to modify the bash script that launches the node by setting "validate=true", but when the validator tries to validate a block, it crashes giving me this error:
"Error During validation, err=validation of block failed, validationType: jit err: unabled to get WASM machine"
undefined says 22207816 and 22207817 doesn’t contain any user tx, and 22207815 contains a classic retryable tx which will return empty trace.
undefined says I’m trying to setup a classic pre-nitro node. How long does it sync? And do we any snapshot we can use?
undefined says https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
undefined says Is this the case for arbitrum? The user submits a transaction to sequencer，sequencer returns a successful response to client, but fails when sequencer posts batch due to a sudden spike in L1 gas
undefined says Could you check out to the latest master and try?
undefined says If failed, sequencer will wait when gas price down and retry, sequencer won’t just try once.
undefined says Who will bear the cost of sequencer's retry
undefined says If sequencer’s gasPrice is not enough, l1 network won’t include it so it has no cost.
undefined says The data has been submitted, but in the process of storage, the gas is not enough. Isn't the gas already submitted wasted
undefined says If l1 doesn’t include the tx, the data is not submitted.
undefined says And when we submitted tx, the gaslimit will be more than what it needs, so no need to worry run out of gas situation.
undefined says ok，get it
undefined says when user submit a transaction through sequencer，will reward sequencer？
undefined says Network will charge 2 types of gas, one is used to submit to l1, another is l2 gas fee which will be used to maintenance l2 network.
undefined says Will sequencer receive any rewards for post a batch?
undefined says Sequencer also a part of entity maintenance the l2 network, so yup.
undefined says that makes sense, thanks
undefined says had another question about the structure of some early transactions, maybe someone can help explain what's going on. In this tx in block 28 https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xa92fe65817fed2e88ec5b511998b6ac76e93df8772b88202d4755422268a3f71 arbiscan says the from address is `0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f`. But when you request the transaction from the RPC, it says the from address is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. Did any eth actually change hands in this transaction?
undefined says After sorting the transaction, a sequencer feed will be sent, to whom??  And what is it used for？
undefined says 
undefined says how to start classic Arbitrum One Node to support arb_exportState query? Thanks
undefined says what、
undefined says The usual way of contacting us on behalf of a project is through the partnerships team, as you just did. In the meantime you can post more specific questions on this channel or, if you don't feel comfortable sharing some information publicly, you can also DM me.
undefined says following up on this, it seems like all L1 -> L2 deposits return the 0 address as their from address. How should one figure out the actual address making the transaction, like arbiscan does?
undefined says After sorting the transaction the Sequencer will publish a message through its real-time feed confirming that it has processed the transaction. This counts as a soft finality of the transaction, meaning that the result of that transaction will not change from there on, as long as the Sequencer is trustworthy.
For a hard finality you would wait for the Sequencer to post the batch on L1, although that may take a few minutes (in contrast with the soft finality, which is almost instant). Most dapps rely on the Sequencer feed for keeping track of finalisation.
You can read more about it here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#sequencing-followed-by-deterministic-execution
undefined says In this page you have information about running a classic node => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node
undefined says ok，thanks
undefined says Thanks， I follow the step, and classic node can run, I want export a state at block 100000, Can it be realized?
undefined says Yes it should be possible => https://developer.arbitrum.io/migration/state-migration#exporting-state
undefined says I follow this step but when i exec the request, class node crash!
undefined says 
undefined says Do the node need to sync to the latest block such as block 2000000?
undefined says hey @José FP | Offchain Labs let me know if you have any thoughts on this—really important for my use case!
undefined says It needs to be synced, yeah. Are you using a snapshot, btw? You can find one here => https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar
undefined says Let me have a deeper look at this and I'll get back to you
undefined says 600GB, is this for class node? not for nitro?how to use it?
undefined says That's for classic, yeah. It should be unpacked on the folder that contains the db of the node. I don't remember exactly, but I think it was actually called "db".
But if you're unsure as to how to unpack it, and you've been syncing your node from scratch, you can let it finish syncing too.
undefined says ok!thanks!
undefined says wanted to ask you how much time does it takes to sync the transactions? more than 10 days passed it still syncs haha
undefined says It might take a good while, depending on the hardware you're using. As long as you can see it syncing, you should be fine.
undefined says I hope you're doing well. I had a question a few days ago regarding classic deposit transaction fees, and I was wondering if there were any updates or progress made on that topic. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! @José FP | Offchain Labs @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says I have a problem Deploying a contract on Arbitrum using Remix.Ethereum. Can anybody help me?
undefined says Hey can you elaborate more on the issue?
undefined says Hey, here is a home for Arbitrum protocol related Qs. Please post in #💬︱general
undefined says So basically I've been trying to deploy a smart contract on Arbitrum Goerli and then Ethereum Goerli.

I have upto 1.2 AGOR (Arbitrum faucet tokens) and upto 0.38 Eth Goerli tokens.

After compiling and I try to deploy i get a Metamask page showing that I do not have enough testnet tokens thereby the confirm button can't be clicked.

If I force the transaction through, it fails yet the network fee is still charged.

I've tried deploying on both Eth mainnet and Arbitrum one, it just brings up a ridiculously high amount, even if I increase the amount on my Metamask the fees just keep getting higher and higher.
undefined says Just to be a bit more clear, you've tried deploying on all 4 networks (eth mainnet, ab 1, arbgoerli, goerli) and it failed?
undefined says Querying the receipt from a classic node might give you what you want, e.g. in the feeInfo section
undefined says Do you know how to identify deposits in pre-nitro? Thanks
undefined says Thx, i restarted the node with the latest master and now works. 
I also modified the bash script and the docker-compose file to run another validator and now i have two validators running, the only thing is that one of them sometimes give me these errors (but still works): 
-"error acting as staker   err="error waiting for tx receipt: SendTxAsCall got: execution reverted: TIME_DELTA for tx hash 0x..."
-"error acting as staker    err="error waiting for tx receipt: SendTxAsCall got: execution reverted: NO_UNRESOLVED for tx hash 0x..."
What may cause these errors?

My objective is to simulate a challenge between two validators for learning how the fraud proof mechanism works. Any idea how to simulate this scenario?
undefined says Do you mean in the arbiscan?
undefined says No, I need to identify deposits from RPC response
undefined says yeah you can't really do that, or just use heuristics. Example is here:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/retryable-tx-panel/blob/1a95fc359cf40d59b8f65789fcc560c1c556221d/src/App.tsx#L73-L85
undefined says Hi! In any trust framework, and in particular on Nova, do data availability committee members get compensated?
undefined says changed the directories now getting this error, 
removed flags` --persistent.chain, --persistent.global-config`
undefined says `       user: 1000:1000`
and granted permission to the mapped directory `/home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data/:/home/user/.arbitrum`
with 
` chmod -fR 777 /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data`
is there anything I need to do to get permissions on the container side
undefined says You need give your host mounted dir permission: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#note-on-permissions
undefined says No need to give permission inside the container.
undefined says thanks, what have i missed?
I thought I covered these steps 
`mkdir -p /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data
chmod -fR 777 /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data`
undefined says Could you give me your full command to start the node?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Has that dir already created? /(home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data/)
undefined says I manually created it, yeah
undefined says `mkdir -p /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data
chmod -fR 777 /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data`
undefined says `/home/user/.arbitrum` is the default directory (in the container) right? and this should persist the db to the folder `/arbitrum-node/data`
undefined says could you `ls -l` to see that die’s permission and see if it set expected?
undefined says 
undefined says ah, the probem, 
I don't have docker compose for use outside root
so using` sudo docker compose up -d` and having `user: 1000:1000 ` in the config cuased and error
fixed by changing to `user: root:root`
undefined says How does an ERC721 bridge to Arbitrum work? Do I need to deploy the same ERC721 contract to both L1 and L2?
undefined says We don’t have official erc721 bridge on arbitrum, you might need to build your own one.
undefined says Those errors are from rollups contract, seems you can take view of this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/test/contract/arbRollup.spec.ts
undefined says I still can't get the db to store locally? the folder arbitrum-node/data is empty
what is the way to map a local file structure outside the container
undefined says Is  `/home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data/arb1` exists?
undefined says no
undefined says What is the logs of your node?
undefined says `--persistent.chain, --persistent.global-config` do I need to add?, though the default was `/home/user/.arbitrum` which has been mapped
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says And is your start command still that you sent to me?
undefined says If you map to /home/user/.arbitrum, you don’t need to set those 2 flags.
undefined says yeah,` sudo docker compose up -d`
docker-compose.yml above - I change `user: 1000:1000` to `user: root:root`
undefined says can't even find where the db is being stored inside the container
undefined says 
undefined says suggest you to rm your current container and recreate one.
undefined says done, stop and rm container, on restart its back to downloading initial database 
so db is not persisting
undefined says Does /home/$USER/arbitrum-node/data/arb1 now exists or not?
undefined says no
undefined says im going to try again and delete the folder, see if the container creates it for me
undefined says still nothing
undefined says Oh, I see, since you use `user: root:root` the db is stored to `/root/.arbitrum`, change the container’s mount point to it  rather than /home/user/.arbitrum  would be ok
undefined says okay, I think i sort of see why im having trouble
undefined says yesss ! this works
undefined says thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs its 4am going to sleep now
undefined says Oh, gn!
undefined says gn
undefined says Hey, about a year ago I had an application that watched for specific addresses of mine to be involved in transactions for monitoring some automated stuff. It did this by connecting to the sequencer feed directly at wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed instead of going through a node.

I am doing some experiments with it again, but I now get HTTP 429, which is normally an error message for having too many connections open / rate limiting. This doesn't make sense to me, as I have only tried to open one connection here afaik (I tried it like 10 times to see if the error would change but it was doing it from the first, and never even got 1 connection to work). Was there something that changed as far as permissions go for allowing direct websocket feed access?
undefined says And FWIW I understand the limit was put in place to stop people from spamming websocket connections for latency races - I just want 1 open
undefined says Update: Seems during busy hours new connections might get HTTP 429, as I'm not getting that error any more. It's just an HTTP 400 now
undefined says Yea, that might be, and we also limit the concurrent connection number.
undefined says If I were to spin up a nitro node tomorrow I might have to wait until quieter hours to get a feed connection then yea?
undefined says Yup, and if you need more than one feed connect, you can run an arb-relay: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#feed-relay and then you can connect to this relay.
undefined says thanks!
undefined says https://api.arbiscan.io/api?module=proxy&action=eth_blockNumber    without apikey, it works. with apikey, it shows:{"status":"0","message":"NOTOK","result":"Invalid API Key"}
But my apikey is correct. is it a bug for arbiscan?
undefined says PSA for Developers: Implementation of API Key requirements starting from Mar 15th, 2023 onwards. Kindly register for an API Key on https://arbiscan.io/register.
undefined says Any details about Nitro L2 block？？
undefined says hey! Were you by any chance able to check in on this?
undefined says Mmm, are you using Quicknode by any chance?
I just tried using Alchemy and it's returning the right address. But yeah, I see that Quicknode is returning 0x0
undefined says ah, I am, good point
undefined says Can you raise that issue with them? We will try to contact them too from our side, but you might get a faster response if you ask them directly.
undefined says yes I will, thanks
undefined says Anyone know how to start a challenge from a validator in a local arbitrum node?
undefined says is anyone experiencing a large amount of errors deploying onto goerli arbitrum?
undefined says I'm getting frequent complaints about gas estimation. 95% of the time or more when I try to use forge to deploy a contract that contains an external library.
undefined says is the deployment still going through?
undefined says you need to be running a local "whitelisted defensive" validator: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-validator#running-whitelisted-defensive-validator
undefined says Is there a timeline for Timeboost release and what the pricing will be?
undefined says and how to get whitelisted?
undefined says when you run it in that mode, locally, with that flag mentioned in the docs, it will be WL'ed
undefined says that is just for local testing purposes; Arb One is still a permissioned validator set for now
undefined says Hmm, so you become a  permissioned validator i guess by completing some tasks? Thx I will try wl locally
undefined says What's the 'InitialChainOwner' of 'ArbitrumChainParams' use for? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/config_arbitrum.go#L30
undefined says no, there is a limited set of permissioned validators that were picked by Offchain labs. We have plans to decentralize and make it permissionless in a future protocol upgrade
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbOwnerPublic.sol ArbOwner provides owners with tools for managing the rollup. https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/precompiles
undefined says I set up etherum l1 and arbitrum l2 in local using running a Local Dev Node in arbitrum docs.

The problem is that I have to deposit ETH to l2, but I don't know how to do it.
undefined says 
undefined says How do we run depositEth here? I'd appreciate it if you could help me.
undefined says :arbiblobblue:
undefined says i guess you can call Inbox contract on l1
undefined says how to call it ??? Please tell me briefly. please
undefined says :arbjak:
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash#L271
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/testnode-scripts/index.ts#L26
undefined says You can see here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/eth-deposit , we show there how to deposit ethers.
undefined says Is the Sequencer responsible for mining blocks on l2? And is the Poster responsible for send batch txn to l1?
undefined says thank u!!!!
undefined says thank u!!!!
undefined says right. but The sequencer's accounts have no ETH
undefined says ok
undefined says If you are still encountering this issue, you could raise it with the etherscan team, who is responsible for arbiscan.
undefined says What details do you need? L2 blocks are blocks of transactions produced by validator nodes by running the state transition function on sequenced transactions and putting them together in a block (analogous to L1 blocks).
undefined says I worked on more than 500+transactions 39days ago.
But I'm not on the airdrop list.
Please check my wallet.

undefined says Hey guys. I wil add Arbitrum Nova network to my dapp. Where to find verified token contract address like USDT?
undefined says Looks like bride to Arbitrum by 3rd party Dapps is not counted for points

undefined says @3s_drep_fi  and myself just published a new topic on Arbitrum research forum about Three Sigma's new article regarding a possible optimization of optimistic rollups challenging periods. This constitutes the first part of a two-part series that will be completely published next week.

Our intent is, primarily, to generate a healthy discussion in order to improve optimistic rollups 🙂

Feel free to discuss on the forum or to talk to us directly here in discord

Nice day to everyone! 🙌

@Ed Felten | Arbitrum
undefined says I have a big request for ARBITRUM Team. put a lot of emphasis on airdrop and multi-accounts, there are really a lot of people who did that, I think it's not entirely fair and should end with absolute disqualification. 1 IP login in muliaccount and 0 airdrop. Be must restrict for this because there are a lot of wankers
undefined says I know than You can do it
undefined says :arbitrum: 💯
undefined says just enter the IP collection bot or cookies on the airdrop website
undefined says Do you have a telegram channel
undefined says no i have own dicord channel
undefined says Do you work together with the Arbitrum team?
undefined says with Coinbase Team in Base. 
I'm mostly an observer here
undefined says Can I ask a question
undefined says Does the 11.62% of token for users will be sent at the same time or will it be another round?
undefined says Hi! Quick question: is the Arbitrum Foundation issuing grants for developers to develop their protocols on Arbitrum One? I got wind of this but cannot find any article or application form...
undefined says It will be all at once. Only one airdrop
undefined says Hey guys, where's a good place to read about deploying Arbitrum L3s permissionlessly?
undefined says Got it I think, I guess I need to wait for the guide 🙂 https://developer.arbitrum.io/chain-launching/launch-a-chain
undefined says We'll come back with the info soon ser:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/chain-launching/launch-a-chain
undefined says Oh you got it! Cool 🙂
undefined says Yeah, go ahead
undefined says Do you have a telegram channel?
undefined says I would like to be an admin on Telegram Turkey channel and Discord server's Turkey channel for you
undefined says You can find all official links in the #🔗︱links  channel.
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
Can you help me?
undefined says Are the errors with points and tokens just ui bugs?
undefined says Sorry we don't have any Turkey communication channels at the moment and we don't plan on adding any right now.
undefined says You are currently on the Twitter agenda of Turkey and if you change your mind, I would like to ask you to contact me and forward my request to the developers.
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs?
undefined says Telegram chat channels are more effective than Discord
undefined says no errors that I'm aware of
undefined says So just UI bugs then? For example I have 5 points but it says I’m getting 1125 tokens, not 2200
undefined says when claiming the airdrop it will be visible in trust wallet or you have to add the token I don't see the contract
undefined says You likely have too few txs pre-nitro as pre-nitro eligibility doubles tokens.
undefined says Claiming is not open yet ser
undefined says i think my wallet should be eligible but it's not for the airdrop. what can be the issue?
undefined says Anyone can send me the tokenomics page please ?
undefined says hey whats your p rice expectation? any guess?
undefined says But 5 points is 5 points no matter when I got them right?
undefined says Can you help me because I don't understand what happened?
undefined says 
undefined says Help🙏🏻
undefined says Also even if I only had 3 points I’d still get 1200
undefined says It matters ser:

undefined says Points earned pre-nitro worth double
undefined says I mean if I earn 5 points after nitro they are worth 5 points tho right?
undefined says WHY  I 'am not on the airdrop list . I did everything you asked for, if you look you will see  I completed all the missions 7 months ago     0x0b783bDbC3710403c00205F77911154EbaB2aE6d
undefined says And 5 points before nitro is worth 10 points correct?
undefined says please verify encore
undefined says the "double points" pre-Nitro is not working.
I checked my wallet and I have 10 points. None of them have been doubled even if I have earned more than 3 points before Arbitrum Nitro launched.
undefined says yea same issue here, have all my txs pre-nitro (on launch) and no double points
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs blz look up my addy, what did i do wrong?
i made 5 points but received just 875 token
undefined says 0x0D1c41d60EF876b3244c9Db50EA5C196CED8e07E
undefined says I was not correctly accrued points on my ticks to everyone !!! please correct the situation on my account for the sake of justice !!!!
undefined says Hoop bridge job and no airdrop😡
undefined says @hunter | Offchain Labs blz
undefined says the double points isn't working for my wallet. all my volume and LP provision was before nitro and my points are not doubled
undefined says Justice!!!!!!!!!!
undefined says I think the issue might be for users that have 100% of their volume pre-nitro. somehow criteria is not picking up the double points
undefined says Could you please tell me what I can do if my Metamask wallet does not connect to arbitrum. foundation. I've been testing and refreshing the page for over an hour. Thank you
undefined says Since my wallet is hacked my tokens will stay there for ever...
undefined says Nothing to do about it right...?
undefined says have u seen any official posts about that? havent seen anything that confirms error yet
undefined says No, just a guess. Seems to be a few people in the same boat
undefined says :l
undefined says has the snapshot already been taken?
undefined says What a sadness that I did all the steps and it didn't give me anything
undefined says 😭 }
undefined says Admins here？Why i have no any airdrop？I am a deeply player on ARB-ONE for 3 years about, and have paid not less of money on it, could you check my wallet please？👇🏻 0x7a45D2C954B060c2bcA4f61b96E964506B7ad8aB
undefined says If you started interacting after august 2022 (Nitro) you have to divide your allocation ,according to the points table, by a half
undefined says No 2x for before nitro, they mean that after nitro points were halved
undefined says i think there are errors on the eligibility checker.... for example, i have 0 allocation when i have over 500 txs across 1 year on arbitrum (its my main chain).. should be on the top tiers...
undefined says wallet for reference:

https://arbiscan.io/address/0xe7f920807a1d6f8c67846fb964d925cd1c874a80
undefined says many people are complaining...

Team should really check into it!
undefined says Seeing people on twitter posting that they got 30k tokens across wallets and here i am with 875 on my main and only wallet
undefined says 
undefined says how is this possible?
undefined says my wallet might be one of the worst parsed by the system...
undefined says If you got multiple points but have a lot less tokens then you think, you should’ve gotten that’s probably because your wallet was considered a Sybil.
If your wallet address got no tokens or fulfilled none of the eligibility requirements when you think it should’ve, it’s possible your address was included in the Hop Sybil token list or your address might’ve been part of a cluster of Sybil activity that was identified.
If you want to check the eligibility requirements to make sure you got the correct amount you can use the following link
https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says My points were not worth double to pre-nitro transactions
undefined says same here.
undefined says https://twitter.com/greypixel_/status/1636400453771579394?t=sluH6yiQ_D6HaHfb02CM_Q&s=19 - I shared this link with @direWOLF🐺 and he thinks I'm a scammer now. Can you guys confirm it's not a scam? thanks
undefined says Is the token address available? If not, when will it be?
undefined says @cryptoboy🚢♒ - I'm preparing an app to get airdrop tokens from compromised wallets without need to share the private key, saw your message on flashbots
undefined says if it's already elig do you have to hold 0.005 arbitrum?
undefined says i see the docs changed, so points pre-nitro are worth 1 and post-nitro are worth 0.5 is that right?
undefined says yes
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs my friend, how about people who got hacked and their token will stuck there?
undefined says we can not do anything about compromised wallets; if a compromised wallet is eligible, then anyone with that wallet's private key can claim and transfer to a different wallet
undefined says hey, i think something is wrong with the front end on arbitrum.foundation
undefined says its calculating badly the airdrop on the front end, taking a lot of time to display etc.
undefined says that why so many people are complaining
undefined says i now see my correct balance, and through 3rd party tool is checked correctly
undefined says sometimes it says i have no allocation, sometimes i have 5k.

third party tool shows me 5k
undefined says @Suga if this happens again, can you open the browser console and show any errors you're getting?
undefined says here you go mate
undefined says this is what is causing turmoil in the community lol
undefined says because it displays 0 allocation, when it in reality those users are eligible.
undefined says no they can't buddy , because the main hacker has implemented a flashbot that send only the eth automaticaly to his wallet , which means he can't get to my token but i cant send eth to my wallet because it's automatically sent to the hacker's wallet , which means my 625 tokens will forever be stuck and thank you for nor assisting me
undefined says which means = i cant claim my tokens , and he doesnt care all he cares about is the eth sent to the network
undefined says which means the token that i deserve , my 626 token will for ever be stuck in your website
undefined says feeling leftover? definitely
undefined says clearly, there's nothing we can do about compromised wallets since there's no way to verify who the original owner of the address is when it's compromised and even in rare cases where we could, it wouldn't scale to millions of users
undefined says hope you stick around mate, there are many opportunities in our ecosystem and future programs that the DAO may come up with
undefined says right , makes alot of sense , a hacker will keep wasting his whole day in the discord asking for assistance
undefined says anyways sure i will from time to time take a look at my tokens lol
undefined says I'm sure it's no solace, but phishing/scams are not unheard of on Discord
undefined says that i can't claim and even get assistance
undefined says well my friend
undefined says i think you dont get my problem dont you
undefined says its a flashbot that sweeps the ETH from networks
undefined says you are not alone, maybe someone can help. send me dm. i will look foward to someone who can code a solution
undefined says i got alot of messages like this mate, most of them scammers
undefined says you might be able to get funds out using mev harder thant the bot.
undefined says I empathize with your issue, and understand what you are saying completely, and I'm sorry to hear that; but as mentioned, there's no scalable way to validate the original owner of an address
undefined says but someone needs to code and bundle the txs
undefined says can i trust you? seems the support can't even help by making excuses
undefined says what can i scam you if you are already scammed?
undefined says lol i can name you the first day i created my wallet and every project i worked using it and when exactly i got hacked
undefined says but ye sure
undefined says lol
undefined says you could also reach out to the Flashbots discord directly
undefined says xddddd
undefined says please dm me
undefined says a man to man
undefined says where can i find them?
undefined says http://discord.gg/flashbots
undefined says @Suga can you check your dm's mate
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs is there any news about chosen which wallet to send your tokens?
undefined says sorry news about what?
undefined says Well some projects let's you chose to put the address you want to send the tokens to so they prevent hackers to claim them first idk
undefined says I'll check, let me get back to you
undefined says Okey thank you thank you 👍
undefined says checked with the team, unfortunately no, it will require a subsequent transfer after the claim. Claims are all on Layer 2, so you should be able to queue up a claim & transfer sequentially easily and cheaply
undefined says also note: claims are not live until next week
undefined says Pretty devastated
undefined says Anyways ty.
undefined says so any ideas about this @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says our front end team is looking into it, will get back to you
undefined says why does `NUMBER` on arbitrum return ethereum block number and not arbitrum block number?
undefined says How can i check if my wallet is on a blacklist, you called it sybilaccount.
undefined says just for consistency with contracts that are ported over from Ethereum with that soft expectation. You can get the Arbitrum block number by calling `ArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber()`
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time#arbitrum-block-numbers for ref
undefined says you can find more about the criteria used here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/sybil-account#what-are-sybil-accounts
undefined says what is it set to? last posted calldata block number? or anticipated next posting block number?
undefined says an approximate (not exact) L1 block number that occurred just before the current L2 block
undefined says I already checked the blacklist but couldn’t find my wallet on it. So i dont understand why i’m not eligable… its my mainwallet with sybilpoints
undefined says have to delete this as we haven't validated this
undefined says ah, sorry
undefined says do with it what you will, but could be a solution you could point people with comprised wallets later on
undefined says where can you see if your wallet is considered sybil?
undefined says yeah, unfortunately can't recommend an unaudited script, but appreciate the effort; feel free to post in other social channels
undefined says and Flashbots won't help more than such approach, whole charging 10% and ignoring ppl with less than 1k
undefined says bumping :)
undefined says hmm when it posts sequencer batch to L1 does it also post block.number used?
undefined says assume there has gotta be some deterministic way to get from L1 calldata to L2 state and knowing block.number would be a part of it somewhere?
undefined says a batch will include many blocks
undefined says There is a blacklist with about 1k wallets in the explanation.
undefined says May i missunderstood something in the mechanissm
undefined says where?
undefined says and yes, it will post `l1BlockNumber` as a field on the compressed data
undefined says yes, but with a tx does block.number/block.timestamp that got used by sequencer get posted too?
undefined says see: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbitrum-ethereum-differences#additional-fields and https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time for ref
undefined says rn for arbitrum gas optimizations does it matter the number of 0 bytes in the calldata or does the compression handle it well already?
undefined says lot of 0s when calling a function with dynamic data types that can be optimized if compression cannot handle it already
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs sorry for the tag, could you help me understand something, if i sent eth to a second wallet is it considered sybil?
undefined says Has the `TokenDistributor` for the airdrop been deployed yet to arbitrum yet?  (This one: https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/1e6bb48cd912ae8448a226f792b10c376bc197ca/src/TokenDistributor.sol)
undefined says Is there a list with blocked wallets? Think its easier to check if the wallet is blocked than hoping for better times and make u so much work
undefined says Cause if the wallet isnt blocked, it should be aligable
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum
undefined says Don't know if this is the right place to do this but here goes. I qualified for the airdrop but my wallet is under a sweeper bot attack. Is there anything I can do?
undefined says follow me on Twitter @Fala133, I have a script for that in the works
undefined says please sir do sum actions against hacked wallet like hashflow
undefined says Followed you but I'm not sure there are flashbots on arbitrum yet
undefined says Can anyone explain me something.. if someone is running node which that includes me and that comes with a cost, will they receive airdrop any time soon?
undefined says there aren't, you just have to try to automate it and be faster than hackers
undefined says Right 
I'm stuck right now. Can't figure out what to do
This is my largest airdrop ever and I'm on the brinks of losing it to an hacker. I can't even figure what I did wrong. I'm pretty sure I didn't interact with anyone sus links
undefined says 0xcc577C130c019529FF1e721F9BEeA24a7DC1402D
undefined says That's the hackers wallet and has been taking a lot of money from different people. Even new wallets that got funded from bybit or binance
undefined says sit tight. In the following days I'll test my script and put a manual how to use it, so you don't have to share private keys. you can see the script in my latest post, it's pretty self explanatory and you can ask ChatGPT if it's legit 😄
undefined says i had transaction in nova about 3-4 mounts ago why it not counted?
undefined says what can i do?
undefined says I was wondering if there is a way that I can programmatically check a bunch of addresses for your upcoming airdrop? Like, an api, contract call, merkle root ?
undefined says https://arbitrumfoundation.medium.com/arbitrum-the-next-phase-of-decentralization-e7f8b37b5226

How does this decentralization plan affect the sequencer?
undefined says I spent money on transaction fees and bought NFT, now I don't receive any airdrop????
undefined says Did you check your eligibility?
undefined says Is the contract address of the token available?
undefined says Me too same
undefined says will there be a reward for the dedication of node arbitrum runners? is this true?
undefined says Yea I definitely don't understand why my main account is not eligable to
undefined says As it seems to me that i met the criteria .. but looking for a way to check programmately
undefined says Does anyone know about this? 🙂
undefined says Need some answer. How can L3 settles on L2 if L2 settles on L1 ? Making it unsecured no ?
undefined says L2 itself is not a settlement layer right ?
undefined says Can any1 check my wallet and answer why I was not given a token, I just do not understand
undefined says you have to meet the criteria and have 3 points to be eligible
undefined says !sybil
undefined says 
undefined says Front end is not working properly, 

Tools like https://arbi.lol/ parse your allocation much more reliably (i dont know what is doing though) and its 100 % safe (no wallet connect).

team could communicate this to stop the noise in the server.
undefined says there will be a merkle root posted in the core claim contract; or you can check the arbitrum.foundation page one by one
undefined says I've seen some unofficial tools for this, but we cannot recommend unaudited / unofficial tools for this for obvious reasons
undefined says I completed 11 points but the site shows 1620 tokens in total, is it lagging? why 1620 if in docs 7270?
550 transactions, more than 10 bridge, fee about $100, volum more than $200.000
0xB87c131E46Fb1560b33dF2564a8E26A901cA8355
undefined says ok , will be as in it's not yet deployed?
undefined says ultimately all calldata on L3 gets posted to L1, so you could always rebuild the state (assuming an L3 rollup posting to an L2 rollup). There are other L3 arrangements that add additional trust assumptions (like AnyTrust), where just a hash of call data is posed to L2/L1 and depends on a Data Availability Committee providing 2 of N honest access to the correct data; it really depends on your use case, some protocols do not need maximum security
undefined says all the contracts are deployed, and the root has been posted to it as far as I know, but I don't have the specific function call available for you yet; we'll release more details and info next week for on-chain queries
undefined says ok i couldn't find the address on your site when i was looking earlier, but if you have that, i am sure i can grab the root from the source which is probably on arbiscan
undefined says yes, it matters some; we use Brotli for compression, so you can test different calldata configurations with it like: `echo "00000000001234dead1234dead" | xxd -r -p | brotli -0 -f | wc -c` if you have brotli available from a local terminal; it tends to favor the 0 variables being front-loaded
undefined says i see. and since im not an engineer or programmer, is it actually possible to settle tx on arbitrum itself ? or it always has to refer to or anchor back to L1 eth ?
undefined says transactions do settle on Arbitrum itself; Arbitrum is a separate (but connected to L1) chain as well as a sequencer of L2 transactions. The question of "finality" can sometimes come up with L2s or L3s depending on the security profile needs of various transactions. But generally speaking, you can consider a transaction whose calldata has been posted to L1 (and confirmed for 2 epochs) to be pretty final; final finality is achieved when the fraud proof window has closed (currently 7 days)
undefined says calldata is posted roughly every 30-60 minutes
undefined says very clear ! thanks a lot !
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs  please check for me, thanks sir
undefined says I used arbitrum from 542 days  ago.
undefined says I used my wallet 0xB87c131E46Fb1560b33dF2564a8E26A901cA8355 
from 10/2020. i dont understand your conditions?
undefined says please check for me ， i do meet conditions    0x04d5BDccd9EF91086C716f0Cf2bEcB357A6a69d1
undefined says Have you been able to check the blocks you have to enable airdrop
undefined says would be cool to implement something to see the "points" you are getting.

also i think not a lot anti sibyl measures have been taking and sibyls are being rewarded very heavily over real users (like farming from 10 wallets is better than being a real user for 9 months of the chain)
undefined says Can someone check mine?
undefined says big ct accs are showing these things, its dissapointing.
undefined says It says I'm ineligible but I followed a lot of the steps.
undefined says https://twitter.com/0xngmi/status/1636389725413195779?s=20

undefined says what
undefined says Approximately how long it takes the verifier to prpose a rblock
undefined says 0xc8909cF515F91840ED6E724e48204BfB6ca9Aae6   not airdrop why?
undefined says hoi
undefined says test
undefined says hi;( Arbitrum command should have warned the last line people like me that the airdrop was over. Spent $62 on this and got NOTHING and I think a lot of people have the same Facepalm!
undefined says I have a proposal, Team  could consider the criteria on Layer3, because most tasks require being a real user, interacting with many projects in the ecosystem, requiring several days to complete and having to accumulate tasks over a long period of time. Please take note and review.  This will greatly reduce fraudulent addresses, and I am very confident about this.
undefined says feel free to propose these types of things once the delegates have been chosen and community can have more organized discussion on it
undefined says delegates will be selected starting next week
undefined says 
undefined says Are there any planned optimisations to compression that can give these benefits to the users transparently?
undefined says My wallet eligible for airdrop but my wallet is hacked hacker setup auto transfer bot please help me
undefined says sorry, but i dont think thats enough to stop sybils.
undefined says even using your roles at least would have required the wallet to have a discord + twitter + mail. wich is a pain for sybils.

or brightID for kyc
undefined says specially when famous ct accounts are claiming to have farmed it from 100 wallets
undefined says the distribution criteria gave more to someone doing 10 txs from 100 wallets. ( 100k) 

than someone providing liquidity for 9 months for example.
undefined says not that I know of, ultimately we have geth EVM at our core so we would not want to introduce something that veers too far off of expectations from mainnet. however, with the Stylus upgrade, any Rust / C / C++ smart contracts will be highly optimized and many contracts written in those languages will see an order of magnitude gas improvement
undefined says our goal is to be permissionless and promote Ethereum values, relying on external social providers is not a great solution for Arbitrum. a lot of accounts claiming to have farmed from 100 accounts are just farming social engagement. we carefully analyzed wash trades and hops. someone providing liquidity to a particular protocol for 9 months was taking a calculated position in the markets, we cannot give pref to any particular protocol on our chain either for the airdrop criteria although we did allocate a portion to protocols to do what they want with it
undefined says 
undefined says please can you help point me in the right direction for airdrop support for arbitrum. I easily meet the criteria, even my Dad is eligible and i used the eco-system more than him. I'm not eligible for anything, I've checked the eligibility criteria and easily hit numerous categories. I haven't done anything suspect. Please how do I raise a support ticket. My wallet address will prove my eligibility, the only thing I can possibly think of is it thought my Dad's wallet was me trying to farm the airdrop which is not the case at all, the blockchain can prove my case, please how do I get support for this
undefined says if it's not on the site, it's not eligible
undefined says But I've hit multiple criteria and done nothing suspect. i've invested a lot of time and effort into the arbitrum eco-system, please if someone would just look at my wallet address on the blockchain it will prove this. How can I be discounted for no valid reason?
undefined says Please Support my problem

I had many transactions 84 days before the snapshot..but still i am not eligible for the airdrop.

KINDLY Recheck my address and please support me 

My address - 0xddD67AdF98dA1E4da21Ce9c5ab5E33efb9ec473e
undefined says Please someone, I can't understand how a valid user who hits multiple criteria been using arbitrum for a year, hasn't done anything suspect at all but isn't rewarded like the rest of the community. Surely there must be someone who I can send my wallet address to to verify. Why wouldn't arbitrum help a valid community member
undefined says our criteria required that wallets had to do 25+ transactions with 10+ protocols over the course of many months in a row both pre-Nitro and post Nitro and not be shown to be doing 0 balance wash trades and hops or be associated with any bot networks
undefined says I've done multiple buys on arbitrum of both nfts and token over multiple months, represented and supported arbitrum of twitter etc hit so much criteria and they won't even check my wallet address for the proof that i'm eligible
undefined says we are permissionless, everything is on chain for this airdrop and this particular protocol
undefined says where to buy tokens
undefined says !sybil
undefined says 
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb3Eaa7ba02C1E382Ab5FD4869Def931ff6B71431 ple support @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs  😦 TT.TT
undefined says Thanks for the reply, I looked at that, sybil system is severely flawed if a valid user who didn't even attempt to airdrop farm can be classified in there. completely unfair for a valid user who didn't try anything suspect.
undefined says can i still participate the airdrop?
undefined says please if something goes wrong please help me I have done my assignment but there is no blue check mark please help

undefined says no hope me too no support 😦
undefined says this is the biggest kick in the teeth of all my years in crypto, how can the system be designed to make someone completely valid ineligible without having done anything suspect.
undefined says Servus! @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs may there a list with blocked wallets? Or did the engeneers solve the problems?
undefined says Respected sir, This is a serious issue which I need your help. Both my primary and secondary accounts are eligible for airdrops. However, both of my accounts got compromised around 6 months ago. Whenever I sent payment to those accounts it transferred to hacker's wallet immidiately due to bot running.
 I can validate that those accounts are mine by doing transaction on other chain where I have fund left. I can also do KYC if needed. Please help me. @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum @admin
undefined says how is gas measured for these stylus/wasm contracts?
undefined says Is running a node rewarded?
undefined says No reward
undefined says those specific details will come later on, but we expect Stylus to launch on testnet in the coming months and can share then
undefined says Please help Sir, regarding above issue. @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs

undefined says My eligible wallet for the token airdrop got comprised and has a sweeper connected to it. Can we request for a change of address so we can claim the upcoming airdrop?
undefined says Bumping :)
undefined says All the contract addresses are here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says Sir ar* circulati*n su*ply?
undefined says If you had a qualifying wallet that was hacked, unfortunately there isn’t anything we can do, and we’re very sorry you were a victim to that.
undefined says You can find information about the token allocation and distribution here => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says Are you using an archive nitro node?
undefined says Sir exact circulatio* su*ply not mention please tell me sir circulatio* suply
undefined says Token has not been airdropped yet, so there isn't any circulation supply. It starts on March 23rd.
undefined says Can you help me add Arbitrum tokenomics information to my website Tokentrack? Its unclear what is the vesting schedule for DAO treasury below:

42.78%    4.278 billion    Arbitrum DAO treasury (What is the vesting here ????)

undefined says Arbitrum Airdrop
undefined says arbitrum admins please create a button for delegate because somebody community wallet hacked and we should send tokens to our safe wallet...

like as:hashflow,op
undefined says @roo (will NEVER DM you first) @Bradley Heimz 
 There's a lot of people here who got hacked, and now the hackers are going to get the tokens and instadump them instead of the tokens being distributed to actual community members. Plus many projects already have a known way to deal with this by either delegating tokens of the hacked address to a new one, or batch claiming them, or some other technical solution. It's definitely possible. I know you guys are busy, but helping us is a net positive for Arbitrum.
On-chain activity makes it clear that I was hacked
undefined says As stated yesterday that team is aware of wrongful wallet Uneligible and engineer was working on that issue can you give any new update on that as surely there are 100's of wallet if not thousand that fulfill the Criteria to get airdrop but still have been disqualified from airdrop
undefined says top goon
undefined says I did not get answer, will in near future running nodes be rewarded? 🤔 it should be according to me if you are whitelisted because running a node is not an easy task.. but is there a plan about that?
undefined says it's true, I have also done a good job, ask the team from arbitrun to check if there are any errors, please provide info.  his
undefined says Node had no value for them
undefined says node?
undefined says There are no plans for rewarding running nodes atm.
undefined says decentralization in a nutshell 🤣 hope the team will make something about that 😄
undefined says Is it possible to reply to my tokenomics question above?
undefined says Correct. And no vesting for the DAO treasury
undefined says Hi! What's $ARB's smart contract address?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says So its 100% unlocked at TGE (the 42.78% from treasury?)
undefined says Namoim wallet shows 625 tokens from aidropa. I believe there should be many more. To whom can I apply with this ?
undefined says Or they will be unlocked by not in circulation
undefined says I'm not sure I understand your question. Tokens are already in the DAO treasury wallet.
undefined says Added the vesting, thank you! https://tokentrack.co/tokens/arbitrum
undefined says Will it be tradable?
undefined says Sir real?
undefined says okey i wanna ask
undefined says is the adress
undefined says What do you mean?
undefined says of the token available
undefined says yet or no?
undefined says okey i wanna ask

is the adress
of the token available

yet or no?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says Sir real data?
undefined says You can compare that information with the one published in our docs for verification => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says can we claim
undefined says the tokens
undefined says in the nova
undefined says network maybe
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st i was wondering of way to help people who got hacked
undefined says in the main a.rbitrum network
undefined says wouldn't it be possible for us to claim in the nova network maybe?
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says Please do not tag random members
undefined says i swear i dont know who to talk to anymore
undefined says the support channel is closed for me for literally 5 hourse
undefined says general chat, no ones replies
undefined says im sorry
undefined says Claiming will happen on the Arbitrum One network
undefined says and nothing to do about it right?
undefined says How many wallet airdrop is arbitrum team?
undefined says because i have a flashbot in my Arbitrum network
undefined says No, only claim your tokens when it opens on March 23rd
undefined says 620k
undefined says i wish it was that simple x)
undefined says only if i don't have a robot installed in the main network
undefined says You can see the token distribution here => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says Information not matching because docs not clear lockup period
undefined says the team should look out for people who got hacked by anyways , they shouldnt leave people over just like that
undefined says there are many ways to
undefined says How many airdrop wallet are thir own?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution#vesting-and-lockup-details
undefined says there is a difference between people who lost there private keys and people who have flashbot installed in their wallets
undefined says which means the people who have flashbot in there wallet would never ever be able to claim their tokens
undefined says im so sure that atleast more that 50k people have that problem
undefined says so about 50k tokens will be just stuck in the Eligible checker website forever and ever
undefined says unfair and you guys say there is nothing to do about it?
undefined says there's awlays something to do about anything .
undefined says I'm truly sorry this happened to you. But there isn’t anything we can do in these cases.
undefined says They removed wallets with over 100 transactions, to airdrop wallets with 5-25 transactions (cheat)
I suspect 30-50% of the wallets in this are theirs.
undefined says where are the team developers then?
undefined says Is there a list with blocked wallets? Do the engineers solve the problem?
undefined says Role only 200k wallet, but they no airdrop. because they dont work.
Total only than 1m wallet. while 620k wallet airdrop. but no role wallet.
undefined says I have than more 200 transactions, and full role, 8 bridge, 4 month. no airdrop. haha.
undefined says while have 300k wallet only 1 transactions, removed.
undefined says I'm not sure what you are implying but the team allocation and the community allocation are different. Team can't access/claim any token that is allocated to the community/users of the Arbitrum platform.
undefined says They picked out 300k wallets with only 5-25 transactions to airdrop.
These wallets are very easy to create quickly, in a short time.
undefined says While we can't provide a full list of blocked wallets, you can find information about the process for detecting sybils here => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/sybil-account
undefined says Will it be swapable to eth ? On uniswap and others
undefined says To Eth or other coins
undefined says I already read the text four times since yesterday🙈 also checked the hoplist if there is my wallet. But no reason found out now! Can u check my wallet?
undefined says $ARB is an ERC20 token, so yes, it will be exchangeable in DEXes as long as there's liquidity provided for it.
undefined says Sorry, we can't check individual wallets. I posted a message on #📬︱support  earlier today (it's pinned) with a few points that clarify how the calculation is done. That might help you.
undefined says Okay cool 😎
undefined says I have seen a lot of people showing that they have hundreds of wallets receiving airdrops that are only 5-25 transactions per wallet.

So your standard is to airdrop a lot of cheat wallets, instead of the few multi-transaction wallets you call sybil
undefined says I have set up a node on aws server but rpc cannot connect.
undefined says Are you getting any specific errors we can look at?
undefined says Please, this is a channel for technical questions about the Arbitrum protocol. If there's anything I can help you with, I'll be happy to assist. Otherwise, I'd appreciate if you leave unrelated comments out of it.
undefined says now 29m block crate. I am not add mm my rpc.
undefined says It is inevitable that a longtime user will transfer funds to more than 20 wallets. For some reason.
No one uses a wallet either. Even if it's a cheat, look at the people's dedication and the arbiterum. They also lost money, taking a long time to follow the chain to 200 transactions.
undefined says Bro. I have set up arbitrum node...
undefined says Is your node still syncing?
undefined says 
undefined says Yeah, your node is syncing, you'll have to wait until it is fully synced
undefined says Can I connect after full sync?
undefined says Yeap
undefined says thank you bro
undefined says Sir, my account is eligible for airdrop but it was compromised 6 months ago. I can validate that it's my account and if required any process to do or KYC to confirm, I'm ready. Please help me. @José FP | Offchain Labs  or may be reserve the token for time being and after verification claim option available. There are many people suffer from hack account. Please do some thing. Thank you.
undefined says No it's failing 95% of the time
undefined says It looks like this is just a problem with estimating gas, nothing to do with external libraries
undefined says Why is it failing all the time?
undefined says Also, why is there a limit for one message every 6 hours in the support channel?
undefined says I guess you come here for support if you're a developer
undefined says If you had a qualifying wallet that was hacked, unfortunately there isn’t anything we can do, and we’re very sorry you were a victim to that.
undefined says What are you using to estimate gas?
undefined says this is forge, like I said in my message
undefined says found this while looking for ways to bundle transactions, is the transaction bundle feature still under development?
https://research.arbitrum.io/t/submitting-transaction-bundles/75/2
undefined says or is there a way to submit transactions so that no other transactions happens between them even if they're not in the same block
undefined says Is the transaction failing on chain? Or before being sent?
undefined says I need node rpc address. 
Is there anyone who can help?
undefined says There are public RPCs available, that you can find here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains
However, depending on your use case, you might want to use a third party node provider => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says There hasn't been any noticeable progress about that development, afaik. But we are working on supporting a new RPC request: `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` , to protect bundlers in some edge cases.
undefined says How does L2 gas pricing and timestamp work with delayed force inclusion?

Could the sequencer censor by posting a batch of txns using all nitrogas UpTo the speed limit of 7 million forcing the force inclusion auto redemption to fail? Force inclusion creates a retryable 🎟️ right?
undefined says what are some specific scenarios where using Arbitrum Nova is better than Arbitrum One?. I've read that Arbitrum Nova is powered by AnyTrust Protocol and not the Arbitrum Rollup protocol which is powered by Arbitrum Nitro.
undefined says I'm very sad. I was very confident about the project and very optimistic

undefined says 
undefined says I have a small question if you can mm help, I installed two nodes 6 months before which are still functional, I would like to know if I too can have an airdrop
thanks in advance
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs i would like to report on some findings which are out of scope for immunefi program
undefined says Firstly, there is a 32M gas block limit beyond even the 7M / sec "speed limit" (which simply raises the price of gas, doesn't exhaust it). However, the sequencer itself does not have gas to spend, so there is no way for it to do that. The batches are ultimately posted to L1 by the staked validators, not the sequencer. 

Once a delayed inbox message has passed the ~24 hour window, ANY account can call *forceInclusion* on the delayed inbox to move the message to the core Inbox. Once in the Inbox, the ordering is finalized and any censorship attacks are impossible (without risking a fraud proof challenge)

See: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job for more deets
undefined says Nova transactions can be an order of magnitude or more cheaper than One transactions. So for many gaming and social applications, that sort of pricepoint is ideal. Suppose a game or protocol wants to subsidize gas for users, even at ArbOne's relatively affordable fee rate, you could quickly spend a lot of money for a game or social app that requires many on-chain interactions. Nova/AnyTrust is ideal for these types of use cases
undefined says Is there some documentation on the differences for solidity developers working on Arbitrum. I have a smart contract that isn't working on Arbitrum but works everywhere else. I'm not sure if Arbitrum handles tuples differently or what could be happening.
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs Is it okay that in your Distributor on Arbitrum you have date's `constructor` args with count block from MainNet?
undefined says Right the sequencer can't spend l2 gas but it can include txns that spend l2 gas in the same timestamp as  the force inclusion txn.

The problem is see is that when the l2 gas cost rises unexpectedly (possibly maliciously), all force inclusion redemptions will fail since those txns paid their gas fee at the time of txn creation (24 hours ago) and now l2 gas is more expensive
undefined says So the txns would revert
undefined says My node is also currently syncing and is around 33 million. Is there a more recent snapshot available?
undefined says I’m worried that my node won’t be able to sync in 6 days
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st Because there is no one who can explain to me why if I have transactions in both arbitrum one and nova the system does not catalog me for the airdrop it seems unfair to me if I have been interacting on it for a long time it will be that someone can help me
undefined says Yeah that is outdated, we obviously dropped FTX from the DAC after their meltdown, the others mentioned remain
undefined says no airdrop for running nodes
undefined says ImmuneFi is the right path to go for any reporting. If it's just a minor issue, feel free to open up a Github issue in the appropriate repo
undefined says yes: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbitrum-ethereum-differences and https://developer.offchainlabs.com/solidity-support, there are only a handful of minor differences. We are happy to help you with any errors you may be getting, can you describe in more detail?
undefined says I'm sorry, can you be more specific and point to the line in the code you're concerned with?
undefined says Thank you. Let me look through these docs and report back if I cannot figure it out 🙏
undefined says ```Arg [3] : _claimPeriodStart (uint256): 16890400
Arg [4] : _claimPeriodEnd (uint256): 18208000```

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9#code

This contract code from Arbitrum but but blocks from MainNet. Is that correct?
undefined says as i mentioned it's flagged as out of scope on immunefi, and seems like the contract in question is not in github to open up an issue
undefined says dm me
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs check dm
undefined says friend request sent, ty!
undefined says Not eligible
undefined says so the force inclusion occurs on L1, I think it's important to understand that point; as long as the L2 wallet for the EOA has enough ETH to execute the L2 transaction, it will execute. A force inclusion will be effectively included immediately after the most recent batch to be posted to L1, even if blocks have printed since then (a reorg in that case). So force inclusions are not redeemed in the same way that retryables are
undefined says still, the original message's sender / signer will need enough L2 gas for the tx to execute
undefined says tryna run my arbitrum node...
few questions to make sure I'm getting this right. What VPS specs do I need? And also, when connecting your VPS account to the terminal, do u just use the normal windows terminal, or do u use Putty?
undefined says okay the fun is over with the token, when chainlink nodes?
undefined says how hard is to run a validator?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration
undefined says whatever terminal / OS / VM you use is up to you
undefined says nodes themselves run on Docker, so you'll need Docker
undefined says Chainlink price feeds are already live; tbh I want to see Chainlink Functions and VRF live on our chains. Hopefully soon
undefined says you're free to follow the steps here and have a go at it: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says seems doable, do I get ETH rewards?
undefined says no, no rewards for running a validator
undefined says hey what's the best aws region of running a node?
undefined says or what region is the sequencer deployed at?
undefined says Is it still possible to get an airdrop somewhere?
undefined says Dear Arbitrum team, Thank you for making it possible for those of us who could not afford to pay commissions on the ethereum network to play in the first division. Also for the airdrop!
undefined says How can i choose language channel?
undefined says Hey. I need help . Can i d-m you please ?
undefined says Will Arbitrum Testnet migrate to Sepolia as well any time soon?
undefined says new question. wen token -> wen protocol 3?

so as long as the validatorset is permissioned, we need to check the validators for liveliness. 

I'm having trouble tracking down how rblocks are asserted and where validators are staking in the assertion tree, and later nodes are confirmed.

could someone point me to the relevant contract which I can check liveliness on L1?
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs hey can i ask a question
undefined says Can I claim the airdrop on a different wallet from the eligible one?
undefined says hey! how will I be able to withdraw the funds and send it to my main eth wallet? any step guide?
undefined says I would like to know why I was not chosen with my wallet 0x2fD52b57FDb6Db3e58Eeff800ccc30a827dCffA2 where more than a year ago I applied for the airdrop and I spent approximately 95 usd in gas and other people who did not spend gas were chosen.

I look forward to hearing from you.
undefined says !Sybil
undefined says **Sybil Information**

If you got multiple points but have a lot less tokens then you think, you should’ve gotten that’s probably because your wallet was considered a Sybil.

If your wallet address got no tokens or fulfilled none of the eligibility requirements when you think it should’ve, it’s possible your address was included in the Hop Sybil token list or your address might’ve been part of a cluster of Sybil activity that was identified.

If you want to check the eligibility requirements to make sure you got the correct amount you can use the following link

<https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution>
undefined says Please check out this tutorial
https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial
undefined says cannot
undefined says Only eligible wallets can be used for claiming
undefined says Cannot use other account or wallet address to claim
undefined says Probably not yet, there is no information yet
undefined says Language channel cannot be selected because there are currently no other language channels
undefined says As far as I know, there is currently no other information that has been airdropped, but you can follow the announcement and https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says I did all these steps 2 years ago
undefined says Hope claim can be using burner wallet to claim to save from phising link
undefined says Has there been an announcement on estimated gas costs for L3s from Arbitrum Orbit? Does a L3 use less gas than a L2? Also, does the average transaction time differ between L2 and L3? Are these parameters configurable for the L3?
undefined says I did all the required steps and did not qualify and my gas expense at that time almost 2 years ago was 95 usd and I did not qualify, it is not fair.
undefined says Is there a full published list of "sybil wallets" can't find myself in the hop bounty but I'm interested to see if I'm located somewhere else.
undefined says How about being able to claim from like the Nova betwork or something
undefined says because there is alot of people who have their Arbitrum network compromised with a smart contract
undefined says i believe claiming from arbitrum nova will be fair enough
undefined says I had activity on the Arbitrum wallet until February 6, but Layer3 shows that I don’t even have one transaction. There is clearly some kind of bug here. Please look

I had many transactions 330 days before the snapshot..but still i am not eligible for the airdrop.

KINDLY Recheck my address and please support me 

My address - 0x94c6C3af0Db80Bd49843af79B58729bB3C9303E0

undefined says what is the average block time of Arbitrum One?
undefined says There is a problem with my running node

Describe the bug
Running into the same issue as #1410, namely node will not start with err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory", after downloading the snapshot.

From what I gather from #1410 this is the issue with the hosted snapshot, wondering if there is a way to get the genesis db snapshot and start the node?

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run docker command from the docs with 
`docker run -d  -v /root/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum --log-opt max-size=10m  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://xxx:6666 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar"`

/home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar Has been downloaded from https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar [660G]

Expected behavior
Node starts up and starts syncing

Can someone explain how to solve it? thanks
undefined says any estimate on this? node currently takes about 1tb+

undefined says think just change the init url

`--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"`
undefined says because you're suppling a file directory and it expects url to wget the file
undefined says Thank you for your answer.
When I first used this `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"`, I found that the created block was very slow. After 2 hours, the block only increased by 1 day

The `l2Block` hash in the log output is different from the `l2BlockHash`. Is there a problem?

undefined says u seem to know stuff
where can I check the traffic/speed of different arbitrum nodes?
I'm tryna pick a new node, so it goes as smooth as possible, and doesn't crash.
So a node with the least amount of users is the choice right?
It's too late for me to start my own sadly. So I'm tryna find the best public one that can handle the traffic
undefined says there's a few options on chainlist, is it as simple as picking one with the latest block height and lowest latency?
undefined says Idk what your usecase is but the public endpoints should be fine if you're not trying anything funny
undefined says If you're gonna spam then pay for endpoint
undefined says for the clam (I can't say it in this channel lol)
undefined says i after the a

As you can see, effectiveGasPrice, gasUsed, and gasUsedForL1 are all 0 but there is a tx fee as per arbiscan. Am I misunderstanding how to calculate the tx fee?

undefined says Excuse me, but only who used the bridge will get the drop? Those who made ART for support the project from the very beginning, get nothing?

undefined says Yo lo hice y no me lo han dado, yo creo que las cosas no las hacen bien
undefined says how does `tx.gasprice` work in context of nitro?
undefined says I hope great project like Arbitrum will be generous to his early followers. Anyone can use the bridge (abuse the system). But it takes several weeks to draw a sticker pack.
undefined says Yes
undefined says Why don't I have the right to brand tokens? I have transactions and use the bridge of the arbitrum 0x5F66FCEd72C75FcdA02864e81255586b754DED3c
undefined says Guys is there an actual DB snapshot for mainnet? @Slipstream @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says Cause I have only `l2Block=22,924,943` from `71,497,242`
undefined says How much time node is syncing ? i want to install node
undefined says I had a lot of transactions on the network but not including airdop. Please check

undefined says ????????????????????????????????????????????
undefined says 
undefined says i spent over 100 usd on that airdrop and i was not chosen it is not fair and my wallet arbitrum one was left with 5.22 usd so it was not pennies .
for me there was a mistake in choosing the chosen ones.
undefined says I need also an actual snapshot of DB for my node. Sharing one would be nice.
undefined says This is the latest snapshot we have for a nitro node: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
( cc @Ilya | Rekt Whale 🐳  )
undefined says Unfortunately it seems it is too old to catch up the actual blocks until token distribution :/
undefined says I have problem with this 
I do more 14 TX in netwok  this 2 point 

First TX before 136 day this 1 point 

Bridge to arbitrum one and arbitrum nove this 2 point 

But my address not eligible 

0x03B82AE2620e993ECe760a1084dd39F6613A7128
undefined says I don't understand why I got banned. this is my main account and i have only one account. I was playing beacon game on this network and I bought and sold nft on it. I didn't do anything else, I think it's wrong
I've been using the same wallet for years and have never had a problem anywhere. this is my main wallet and my only wallet.
NFT poweruser Blacklist  ??  @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says If you were not eligible, they’re verifying the eligibility again, I have more than enough transactions but wasn’t eligible 
Let’s hope they make it fair cos it’s not
undefined says bumping this- also I confirmed that by accessing the classic node directly I get the expected pre nitro feeStats. But still open question why nitro nukes the gas cost in the RPC response 🤨
undefined says Hacker gone my airdrop 😭😭😭
undefined says hmm small question, but does arbitrum fraud proof verify calldata against submitted DA data?
undefined says are you posting a .csv with the merkle proofs in github?
undefined says yup, it will: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L542
undefined says wait but the code that you sent only includes the check for the inbox size; I was wondering if let's say I am submitting a fault proof for tx #1123 and attach my proof data will it be verified against the data posted as part of the DA or no?
undefined says @onlineixm you need help on your hacked wallet I built a bot pm me if you need help
undefined says I was trying to post the question here but it kept getting blocked: https://research.arbitrum.io/t/l3s-l4-and-etc-tokens/9170
undefined says Yeah, this is too old (approx. 21M block instead 71M for now)
undefined says @onlineixm
undefined says It also on the same function, if you look following code, you will see this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L573
undefined says We currently don’t have a snapshot after this state.
undefined says Sorry, if your wallet private key is leaked, you need to use another secure wallet. But for wallets that leak private keys, the arbitrum team and community can't help you do anything else

I think what you can do is to claim the airdrop at the first time, and then transfer to a safe wallet in time
undefined says The bot is faster than anyone
undefined says The private key of the wallet is leaked, and there is nothing we can do about it. I hope you understand that this is beyond our capabilities
undefined says What you need to do may not disclose the private key in the process of using the wallet in the future to protect the security of the wallet
undefined says team has done their best to control the bots, but no one can 100% guarantee that there won't be any bots
undefined says What blocks you?
undefined says but this account isnt used anywhere? or it's planned to be used in the future for fault proofs
undefined says What do you mean by this account? And why not used?
undefined says I was wondering if Challenge process references call data posted on chain to validate data submitted by one of the fault proof participants
undefined says so when I look at addSequencerL2BatchImpl, all of the data is just emitted as logs, but is not actually used in fault proof process, unless I'm missing something
undefined says Guys, Help <
Is there somewhere you can download the full Arbitrum node in a single archive?
undefined says The bot lol. Whatever in my message was triggering the message to be hidden or not posted.
undefined says That data if we store as state it would cost too many gas (20 k for only 32bytes), but if we only set it as calldata, it would be much cheaper (16 per byte). And we hash that data so rollups contract can still verify it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Bridge.sol#L100
undefined says You can follow this guide to set up your node: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Hmm, maybe you avoid say like h i or h e y?
undefined says hmm, but it seems that data is only verified in OneStepProverHostIo.sol, otherwise, other step calls are verified without dbl checking the call data
undefined says can anyone help with this? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @gzeon | Offchain Labs
undefined says Before osp, it only compare their state is same or not.
undefined says so does it mean that theoretically sequencer can submit not 100% correct calldata and fault proof would not work in some scenarios?
undefined says The node will skip those wrong calldata, and if some node not choose to skip, they will have a different state, then they will interact to find where the different state is, then they will find one of those node execute a wrong calldata.
undefined says but is it enforceable on a smart contract level? as in it's 100% certain that node can prove that they are executing correct data
undefined says the tx.gasPrice will return what ethereum mainnet return, which is the actual gas price you spend.
undefined says Incorrect calldata will cause the evm revert that tx, it is also a part of opcode execution.
undefined says https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/sybil-detection/issues/3
undefined says is it hardcoded to 0.1 gwei?
undefined says Not all of the node is here
undefined says Nope, it will also increase when tx increase, and it will be affected by l1 gas price. The 0.1 gas is the minimum gas price.
undefined says What kinda node you want to run?
undefined says Arbitrum One Nitro
undefined says Hm. Well, I posted the link of the question I made. I just posted on the forums so I could link it instead.
undefined says Hmm, it just showed this on that page. (With chain id 42161)
undefined says Hey guys, I'm trying to setup an arbitrum node.

I ran this command: "docker run a68523cc2cb4 --init.url=<url> --l1.url=<alchemy-free-rpc> --l2.chain-id=42161"

And it seems to have successfully downloaded the init database, and decompressed it, but afterward I kept seeing what looks like errors messages from Alchemy, the L1 RPC provider I use, saying that I was running into throughput limits. I am using their free tier, which allows 150 requests/second. 

Should I ignore the errors and hope it syncs, upgrade to a paid tier on alchemy, or get my own L1 node?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs help?
undefined says Anyone know how to get sync status from RPC? `eth_syncing` is not working.
undefined says Hmm, do you use your alchemy rpc in other apps? I remember the free tier should be enough
undefined says Are you running classic node? You can also see your log, it will show your current block height.
undefined says how to know is synced or not if I just read the current block height?
undefined says Nope. Just one. Going to try it again, so I can send you the full error messages.
undefined says what is min system req to run a node
undefined says my system is 20core cpu, 20gb ram, 300gb ssd
undefined says Yup, you can use that way, are you running classic node right?
undefined says Hmm, 300gb is not enough, you need more than 1.5t
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration
undefined says hey I've redownloaded nitro.tar and started the node twice but after the extraction phase, I run the node without the `init.url` flag and I get a bunch of these errors, before shutdown:
```
WARN [03-20|08:33:30.460] error reading inbox                      err="not found"
```
As you can see, the message is not very helpful, what could I change?
undefined says before that, everything look fine, l1 connects
```INFO [03-20|08:33:28.058] connected to l1 chain                    l1url=http://127.0.0.1:8549 l1chainid=1```
undefined says there's a more detailed message before shutdown
```
ERROR[03-20|08:33:59.663] shut down due to fatal error             err="error starting node: error starting inbox reader: failed to read init message"
```
undefined says okay and how long it will take to sync with current block
undefined says i reckon that's for an archive node, do I have the option to run a "full" node instead?
undefined says ok so apparently it was because local eth node was pruned
wondering whether an archive node is necessary only at startup or a pruned node will be sufficient
undefined says what's the block number on that one?
undefined says I setup node from this page: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node, is it a classic node?
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs hey, are there any recent new snapshots? i mean newer than block 40kk
undefined says @roo
undefined says Does your l1 node finish syncing?
undefined says 4-7 days perhaps.
undefined says The default way to start is full mode, only you add `--node.caching.archive` would then be Archie node.
undefined says 2022 December if I remember correctly.
undefined says It’s nitro node, then it should support eth_sycning, any errors return when you call it?
undefined says No, only nitro-recent.tar is the most recent.
undefined says Assuming you use nitro-recent and an NVME SSD, do you think you could feasibly do it in <  3 days?
undefined says Is there a possibility that a transaction will be executed successfully on L2 but failed on L1? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says How can I clear the node domain I have installed? I need a code for this. Because I don't have enough ssd space. 

I have another question. I will create a new node, updated LATEST BLOCK
71746263 what is the total size of this data. Or is there a place where we can learn?
undefined says Excuse me, I started the node and saw that the log L1Blcok is the latest block of '16868515'. However, the L2Block and the block browser display are different. Is this normal
`INFO [03-20|11:13:55.387] created block                            l2Block=49,546,000 l2BlockHash=a85c01..e3f0d0 l1Block=16,868,515 l1Timestamp=2023-03-20T11:13:55+0000`
undefined says how can I understand the arbitrum full node is fully synced?
undefined says I've been syncing here for 3 days, and there seems to be a problem. As shown in the log above, calling to obtain the balance now reports an error
undefined says Are you using this document? https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node
undefined says Yes, it could
undefined says I don’t think so, if it doesn’t be confirmed on l1 due to gas price too low, we will wait and re-try.
undefined says Any airdrop ?
undefined says The current database: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node#minimum-hardware-configuration , we currently don’t support clear manually, but it should be supported in the future version.
undefined says It say this
undefined says What is the version of your node? And what is your start command?
undefined says `docker run -d  -v /root/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum --log-opt max-size=10m  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://xxxx:6666 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar"`
undefined says Follow the instructions on the document, and it's unclear what went wrong
undefined says docker image version `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec`
undefined says I am using this https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Hey guys, trying to get a classic archive node working. I downloaded https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar - untarred it successfully into "db" inside the directory that I supply in the start command
undefined says This is my start command:
undefined says ```sudo docker run --rm -it -v /home/data/arbitrum-mainnet:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url=<L1_URL> --node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000 --node.rpc.tracing.enable
```
undefined says (I do supply a valid L1 URL)
undefined says When running, it just executes for a few mins and then completes silently with no further logs:
undefined says 
undefined says ``` {"level":"info","component":"arb-node","chainaddress":"c12ba48c781f6e392b49db2e25cd0c28cd77531a","chainid":"a4b1","type":"forwarder","fromBlock":12525700,"time":"2023-03-20T12:39:07Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-rpc-node/cmd/arb-node/arb-node.go:236","message":"Launching arbitrum node"} ```
undefined says Did you use the interface to query the balance and return the correct ?
undefined says I didn't, it just printed that on screen after running the docker command to init the node
undefined says My node reports an error when querying the balance. Using a public node to query the balance is normal
undefined says Hey, I've been encountering a couple of errors while trying to bridge an ERC20 custom token using the Arbitrum bridge. The custom token contract can be found here: https://arbiscan.io/token/0xa0459edcad5aac14dc32775d22ff7bd33027cac7, and I'm attempting to bridge tokens from this address: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x77d327b28978e4d6A46fB91BbAA46e3110ED818E.

The thing is, that from time to time I'm having problems, but I just tried bridging and It worked! 😄

Nevertheless, Here are the errors was facing:

"Error: missing revert data in call exception; Transaction reverted without a reason string"
"Uncaught (in promise) Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit"

Im working with both custom arb-ts and ethers.js implementation and https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ client.

Could you help me understand how to resolve these errors in the future, or provide guidance on what I might be doing wrong? Any help would be much appreciated.
undefined says Guys, does anyone have a more recent snapshot than the 21M block from the team?
undefined says I understand this I can give some head up good you got it
undefined says What's the right command for running an Arbitrum node? L1 Node is ready on my server.
undefined says 
undefined says After running the command, how long does it take to wait for sync complete?
undefined says Where can I get some help about full node troubleshoting?
undefined says Do you know which address changes its balance for the transaction fees in a setL1BaseFee transaction?
undefined says the nitro-recent file is from 40M
undefined says guys
undefined says can someone help me
undefined says which nitro-recent.tar file should i delete? there is two


one on docker diff one on docker merged

/var/lib/docker/overlay2/9df386a4817c5a040a6c479c6ee8c95109473a7acff29f74ccecae5c71e07f5e/diff/tmp

undefined says i need more free storage
undefined says 0xeb716c538aa9726c8eb2f119ff4690aa93b76955
undefined says I didn't see that. But it doesn't matter much since the current height is 71.8M
undefined says Do you have a synchronized node?
undefined says Well, my VPS is doing about ~8000 blocks/min. At that rate, if you start with 21M block height, it will take you ~105 hours to sync.
undefined says While 40M, will only take you about ~64 hours.
undefined says And nope. I'm trying to sync too.
undefined says @thejoulethief can you delete 40m tar file after you start creating blocks?
undefined says Sorry, I wouldn't know, never synced a node before
undefined says but whenever I tried stopping the node, it wanted to start from the beginning again with the init argument
undefined says So I wouldn't recommend it if you can avoid it
undefined says yes
undefined says when the blocks start to flow
undefined says you can erase .tar
undefined says i am currently trying to setup a local node, but now i wonder how could the L2 take 1.5tb? not even mainnet takes that much and Arbitrum this far have a lot less total Transactions. what am i missing?
undefined says :arbichief:
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs hey do you have technical knowledge?
undefined says Hey, seems like a gas estimation issue. You need to provide more gas. 
Do you use arb-ts? I think you mean SDK right?
undefined says Do you want it for full node or archival?
undefined says Please find the command here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says It depends on your pc config
undefined says Please check https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
And https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
If you couldn’t find the issue drop your q here
undefined says Node size is now around 540 GB. But the growth rate is ~3 GB/day. So you need to have enough space to handle the node in future
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs 
I have a sync running node
What should I do to copy this node from one host to another
So basically how to make nitro.tar with 70M block
undefined says You need to move your node’s db directory to your new machine so it won’t take too long to sync
undefined says I moved it, but now I donno how to use "docker run"
undefined says I'm getting this error
undefined says ERROR[03-20|18:33:02.039] error initializing database              err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
undefined says Full node
undefined says Greetings @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs, can you help me with this? Not sure what's the bottleneck here..
undefined says I have a friend with an airdrop eligible wallet, that sadly, has been compromised. Luckily, the attaker allows small amounts of eth to remain on the compromised wallet, so I was thinking of creating a little script that waits for the first block of the claim, calls the claim function of the token distributor contract, and transfer said tokens to a safe wallet.

Do you have any better ideas?
undefined says Hey goes does arbitrum allow bundled txs?
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs hey mate
undefined says i'm creating blocks
undefined says currently made 7 million blocks after downloading 40 million tar file
undefined says but my storage is not increasing
undefined says its still 61% full
undefined says is arbitrum node purgeing files?
undefined says or something is wrong
undefined says hey guys, icant claim my tokens(not airdrop) on L1 after bridging back from L2 and the 7 days wait. after clicking claim it says "Can't claim this withdrawal yet". what to do?
undefined says on official arbitrum bridge
undefined says I need your help to solve a problem.

I bridged ETH on Arbitrum One, made 26 transactions before the snapshot, used the network for 3 months as can be seen https://arbiscan.io/address/0x512F59F9Ef11C432a48793bFF17D23C659459F27.
 
According to the information available I am therefore eligible, however when I logged in to see if I was eligible, to my surprise I am not.

I went to Dune (https://dune.com/blockworks_research/arb-airdrop), where you can check eligible addresses and I see that my address appears with an allocation of 875 tokens.

Can you tell me why I am being told that I am not eligible on arbitrum.foundation?

I specify that I connected with the correct account, there is no error on this side
undefined says Rt
undefined says Check with contract
undefined says You are eligible to claim 875 bro
undefined says 
undefined says This is what I also noticed on Dune but when I connect to arbitrum.foundation I have a message that I am not eligible.
undefined says Anyone got a solution for compromised wallets then please share with us.
undefined says I have a bot that can help
undefined says Mr/mrs muffin, can we stake our tokens? @eli_defi | Arbitrum
undefined says I sent a dm to you and others in support, because no one is responding
undefined says Please enable delegate
undefined says Please😭😭
undefined says Hi! Is anyone from the developer team able to chat?
undefined says had a couple questions around sequencer decentralization, thanks!
undefined says Yo!
undefined says is there a snapshot we can use that is different from the default nitro.tar that will allow us to sync faster than starting from block 22m?
undefined says dm me on twitter @Waltjs
undefined says @ waltjsmith
undefined says Any one  please help to solve hacked wallet ( bot transfer)
undefined says I'm working on it
undefined says Does anyone knows possible issues why my arbitrum node is giving me error connecting to L1?
undefined says @Saulman   help me bro please
undefined says DM
undefined says This is the error I'm getting while I'm starting the node...I have a fully synced Ethereum node which I connect to in local. I tried to run the node both with the command line and with the docker-compose.yml
undefined says checked a few minutes ago
undefined says 
undefined says 0xcc577C130c019529FF1e721F9BEeA24a7DC1402D

this account has compromised nearly 3,000 wallet addresses and is set to claim about 3 million tokens from the airdrop, please team do something about this and the victims
undefined says 0xC4517D59F6b8B1FA3f5a9605649897765F4aC035

I did not receive an airdrop even though I made a transaction on the network.
undefined says You need to init. See the commands here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says 0xa47B6bd4Da97421BD15DdF73D35dED2F0815cEA6

Check plz
I didn't receive the airdrop.
undefined says For full node you can use https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
This is the newest snapshot we have
undefined says Do you mean batch txs? Yes we support json batch txs
But flashbots bundles is not active on Arbitrum
undefined says Could ask it in #📬︱support
undefined says You can ask your questions here or in #🔬︱research channel
undefined says Yeah you can use https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says Are you sure you’re not running anything else on this port?
undefined says The website with the application for the airdrop shows a block of the e t h network. Does this mean that a r b Airdrop will be released on the e t h network and not on the A r b i t r u m network?

And how fast are the blocks executed on the A r b i t r u m network?
undefined says Any solution for hacked wallet
undefined says Where?
undefined says why i can't read contract?
undefined says Can You helpme ?
undefined says arbitrum node rewards when ?
undefined says I am running a Nitro RPC node, I sync it from scratch (toke 2 days) and now is getting the latest blocks but I noticed a leg in the logs, I got created block log for the block 71,969,733 and the another created block log for the block 71,969,737, so it kind skipped 3 blocks?.  Is it just a logging issue or it really skipped some blocks and the EVM state will be outdated for around 1s, after 733 until the 737 block?
undefined says yeah I'm sure, the server is brand new and I'm just running Ethereum and Arbitrum. By the way I managed to start sync the node but using an ethereum RPC public. How is this possible? Is there anything that I need to do ethereum node side?
undefined says Do I maybe need to use the --rpc flag in my ethereum node? @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs
undefined says Please any solution My account has compromised by the same wallet please need a solution i write several mails and no one answer me.
undefined says What do you expect they could do mate? We're in DEFI. The only solution is to write a script faster than the scammer. I'm doing that for other guys, so if you want, you can DM me
undefined says Nope, you need claim it on arbitrum one.
undefined says No reward
undefined says Hey, it’s ok, the others block has already been synced.
undefined says Please any solutions for the comunity affect  bye the hacker stolen My founds ando also create a Smart contract
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs could you please help me with the node issue? Also if you know the answer, is there any difference in terms of sync speed between syncing with a public rpc L1 and a local ethereum node?
undefined says so the team will do nothing about the hacker who got thousnds of eligible wallets of victims?
undefined says You might need this: https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/docker-network-example/ , 127.0.0.1 cannot visit others container’s port, or you can also add —host to your container.
undefined says wow, thank you..I was losing my mind
undefined says Will steal when i claim
undefined says It’s really hard to handle this because we also can’t verify that address is your address.
undefined says again? They CAN'T do anything. It's not that they don't want to
undefined says you know what's going on lately?
undefined says Who says you're not the scammer and you're trying to block the aidrop for the legitimate owner? Once you lose the key, you lose the ownership..or at least you share it
undefined says you seem like you don't know what's going on?
undefined says What do You need to know  i have all the proofs
undefined says It’s hard to kyc an address
undefined says I know what's going on..there's a scammer who stole a lot of wallets. I'm helping a couple guys to take the airdrop anyway. But still in defi you can't know for sure who's the owner of what
undefined says so basically  two adresses will steal about millions of arbitrum tokens and the team realllly has nothing to do about it?
undefined says So stop complaining and start finding a solution yourself. I just told you one
undefined says please atleast make sense
undefined says its not about me only mr Karen
undefined says im talking about the project in genral
undefined says one single person will have about millions of arbitrum tokens
undefined says what do you think will happen?
undefined says WTF you don't know the basics man. Just stop it's not easy as you're saying
undefined says it's not mate , just check the first time you fund your wallet from an exchange and give a prove that's it , keep making excuses
undefined says it's not mate , just check the first time you fund your wallet from an exchange and give a prove that's it , keep making excuses 2
undefined says anything else?
undefined says or if it was sponsored from another wallet then show the prove that you own the other wallet
undefined says keep making excuses
undefined says 🤡
undefined says there is always something you can do .
undefined says to revoke a contract you need to connect from your wallet, right? I try to do it but I don't have the eth because every time I try to deposit they take it out, what more proof is it how I'm connected if it's not my wallet if you want to see all the transactions and how do they take out my eth every time I deposit I'll leave you the wallet
undefined says Awesome thanks

I have been looking into shared sequencer sets

wondering if Arbitrum has covered this at all or is considering it
undefined says 
undefined says if you have a sweeper bot in your wallet you cant revoke sh0it cuz the eth is gone automatically to the hacker's wallet mate
undefined says you're right, now the arbitrum team is going to KYC 3000+ wallets just because you've lost your key...coooome on
undefined says Also wondering abt grants
undefined says wrong
undefined says a big project would probably do it with no problem , you are confusing yourself mate
undefined says ye flashbots right? never means you are safe
undefined says nah
undefined says As you can see, this is the contract that they created for me to get my arbs out of the airdrop. It is not difficult to realize that there are 3000 people with the same problems attacked by the same hacker.
undefined says lightn me sir
undefined says I did it so many times in bnb chain where flashbots doesn't even exist
undefined says i found out about the bnb one , but i didn't find nothing related to arbitrum network
undefined says then you must pay me, better do not lolz
undefined says help the community you can't turn a blind eye to us the project is successful and now they are abandoning us this is how they pay the community
undefined says bruh if you helped me i would definitely pay you duh but the question here is
undefined says can i trust you
undefined says that's the problem
undefined says i got like 1000 of people trying to help/Scam me more
undefined says Sure you can't trust the scammer xD Anyway I'm a known community member in Pancakeswap TG group..you can join there and ask 🙂
undefined says imagine the project itself knows that a hacker got 3000+++wallets and are like( well you know we got nothing to do  he can get millions of our tokens whatever )
undefined says But still, I have to finish the script and sync the node so...not sure if I can help atm
undefined says help me , i ll pay you
undefined says a man to man
undefined says I can't imagine bro that's the reality. what is the difference then they are the same or worse than a traditional bank
undefined says and there is nothing you can do bud , x)
undefined says Question about gas fees that are shown on arbiscan: what determines the L1 fee and is the L2 fee always dependent on the funtion used (so that same function is always the same L2 amount)
undefined says l1 fee depends on your calldata size which need to be included in l1 and l1 gas price. The l2 gas used is only associated with the op code.
undefined says Thank u ser
undefined says It didn't help much unfortunately 🥲
undefined says I already use the flag network host
undefined says Is your geth running within docker or just on your host?
undefined says No it's running on the host..that's the problem
undefined says you're saying I should stop it and run with docker?
undefined says I hate these dockers ç_ç
undefined says Ok, so you can see what your local network ip is and change 127.0.0.1 to that network ip.
undefined says You can use ifconfig to see it.(if you are using Linux )
undefined says But that would mean to open the ports right? I can't do that
undefined says It seems so weird that 2 node on the same machine can't communicate each other just because of the container 😐
undefined says You can just add `—host` to your docker start command.
undefined says I already have --network host if you mean that
undefined says Oh, you mean --network="host" doesn’t work?
undefined says nope...also just tried using the IP and still connection refused
undefined says Can you connect to your l1 node directly?
undefined says like how exactly? Until now I just attached to the javascript console
undefined says If you have a command line test to try the connection, I can try it
undefined says But I guess that's not the problem, cause the beacon chain is also connected (using prysm)
undefined says I mean, send rpc request from your host to your l1 node directly like this: https://www.quicknode.com/docs/ethereum/eth_blockNumber
undefined says I just did it xD and that's the suprise
undefined says 
undefined says Ah, if so, might something wrong with your node, you should check your l1 node’s running status.
undefined says Yeah, maybe the flags I used to run it. Gonna check it now, thanks
undefined says I think I get it...I used a config.toml file and I thought that having all parameters there I shouldn't use the flags like --http 😐 I guess I was wrong lol
undefined says Yesss working now, thank you a lot 🙂
undefined says I see. But what is taking up so much data? The state surely can't be .5 tb already?
undefined says There is not only state tree but also tx tree and receipt tree and block headers.
undefined says Do KYC to stop bots..
undefined says If we have metamask histroy of txs since wallet is created it is known that we did it
undefined says How much fee will take to claim
undefined says Who can I get help with airdrop?
undefined says Anything possible in crypto 🚀🚀
undefined says 443 days ago, I made 9 trips in the arbitrum, but it seems that I did not receive airdrops.
undefined says 
undefined says guys what dedicated server i can use for full node? i mean can u give some site link or somthing ?
undefined says You did the transaction more than 1 year ago..🤦
undefined says I am finding it hard to get AGOR eth for the arbitrum goerli testnet, can anyone point me to the right direction.
undefined says This link has all you need to run a node: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Please try this faucet here: https://goerlifaucet.com/ and bridge to arb-goerli
undefined says hey any rewards for finding bugs in the contract 


`0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9`
undefined says is there a way to specify --init.url to not download to /tmp before unpacking as i run out of space in tmp?
undefined says feel free to send your finding here: https://immunefi.com/bounty/arbitrum/, we will reward it.
undefined says You can download it first and move it to wherever you want then use `init.url` to that dir.
undefined says I used the bridge to transfer ethereum on your network, I also did a swap, but the airdrop is not included in my terms, why?  please check it.  0x0a143cd465479dFb3559b08913ee86b013372df3
undefined says Can I  transfer my airdrop token to my other wallet ????
undefined says Why you have double slash prefix before file? I'm trying to set this field to precise url of snapshot at my server and it's just didn't work, said that there is "no such file or directory" (I checked path 100 times)
undefined says sir，I found that there is a gap between the score and the number of corresponding tokens described in the rules. What is the problem? For example, I can only get 1125 points for 10 points, but in the rules, I can get 6,750 points. Is there any problem with the data, please answer it, thank you
undefined says @roo
undefined says I couldn't solve it from this link
I moved my DB to another host
and now I need to initialize my container from that DB
to do that may I use -> --init.url="file:/root/data/db"
or what should I state instead of init
undefined says @Arbitrum Support 

Can you help me? Trying to run a Nitro node. Downloaded a latest snapshot from here https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar

Trying to run a node by passing --init-url="file:/mnt/.../nitro-recent.tar" 

And it is just saying that it cannot find the file but it is certainly there. Is it related to wrong docker usage, or what? Please help
undefined says did you mount the file?
undefined says I am trying to use local file as well
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Note the file name is your docker’s file name, you should use -v to mount that file first.
undefined says Please check our new docs, the point after nitro upgrade will be half: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says It happens to be my tar was corrupted. So I deleted my post.
undefined says If you already have one db, you need mount that db to /home/user/.arbitrum
undefined says Mount that file to your docker, and that dir should be your docker path.
undefined says Hey, Have got an issue, I am running my node using docker, I stopped docker and restarted it again and the node started re-syncing afresh, is there a way I could resume the node sync with its previous progress.
undefined says Did you mount your dir last time? What is your last time start command.
undefined says 
undefined says I am trying to paste my configuration but the bot flags me. Yes is did mount my dir 

```
volumes:
            - '/arbitrum/arbitrum-node/:/arbitrum/.arbitrum'
```
undefined says I have a problem, on arbiscan and Dune my address is eligible for 875 tokens, yet when I log on to arbitrum.foundation I am told that I am not eligible?
undefined says i see, but isn't the only thing a node need to decide if a tx is valid or not the state tree? since ORs are a 1/N trust assumption i think it is VERY important that running a node that has the ability to challenge the sequencer is as easy as possible.
am i missing something?
undefined says I did the whole airdrop thing and spent about $90 in fees and transfers why not subscribe
0x2539E5428b3F92aA068dDc58B08eE4848b701DFc
undefined says Refresh
undefined says 21年做过的没有资格
undefined says Is there docs on what is included in tx.gasprice ? Evidently doesn't include the L1 fees. Is this the same for gas left? 

Is there a way for caculating gas use on chain? Thanks
undefined says I am running the node in a service, but have mounted the dir in my configuration as shown above
undefined says Trying to run a node but when running the initial command
```
docker run --rm -it  -v /data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.12-alpha.7-5834021 --l1.url RPCURL --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
```

It throws this error: `CRIT [03-21|12:22:02.988] couldn't create jwt secret               err="open /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/jwtsecret: no such file or directory" fileName=/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/jwtsecret`
Any idea?
undefined says it didn't work
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs do you know what's the time to sync average? Cause I'm using a powerful server and it's syncing like sooo slow (something like 1 day timestamp in 5+ minutes). Also it doesn't seem to store data on the host but only on docker. So I guess if I stop the docker it'll start from scratch
undefined says Contract address?
undefined says Contract address pls?
undefined says The mount point from the node should be `/home/user/.arbitrum` (the second part of the volume param)
undefined says Your address may have been flagged by the sybil detection algo, not sure if the blacklist is public
undefined says Using that path I get "Fatal configuration error: unable to create chain directory: mkdir /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1: permission denied"
undefined says tx.gasprice returns the gas price bid for the transaction.
Gas usage is different than its price. You can get the gas left on the block by calling gasleft()
undefined says Ok that's how I'm doing it, but the tx.gasprice is lower than the actual usage. Is there a way to account for the total gas billed?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Could you please help me solve this? I'm having issue to sync and also it doesn't store data on the host, so if I stop the docker and start it again, it starts from scratch
undefined says `docker run --network host --rm -it  -v  /home/arbitrum-node:/home/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url=http://localhost:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug,txpool --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=* --ws.api=net,web3,eth,debug,txpool --init.url="file:///home/.arbitrum/snapdata/nitro.tar"`
undefined says Second part of the -v param should be `/home/user/.arbitrum` otherwise it won't keep track of the synced data.
If it is giving you permission issues, check the first part of that param, `/home/arbitrum-node` . Does that directory exists and can docker write on it?
undefined says ok I chmod 777 the entire folder and now it works. Anyway what abot slow issue sync? With this pace I'm gonna take a week to sync...while I have synced the entire Ethereum network in half a day
undefined says gas price and gas usage is different though.
The final fees paid are => gas price * gas usage 

If you are asking for the effective gas used in a transaction, you have "gasUsed" in the transaction receipt
undefined says It does take some time to sync. Are you using an SSD drive?
undefined says Ok nice it's also finally writing data on host
undefined says yeah SSD data center in raid0. Can't do better than this
undefined says Check the permissions for /data/arbitrum . Does it exist and can docker write on it?
undefined says Is ETH a banned word?
undefined says ok not sure why my message was flagged
undefined says Maybe using "h i" or "h e y" or something similar ?
undefined says And your specs are similar to the recommended ones, right? https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
Otherwise, it just takes a while to fully sync for now.
undefined says my specs are way higher than the reccomended ones
undefined says Is there a guide on the expected changes in opcode behavior from ETH?
undefined says Not sure, I typed it out twice with two different ways of saying it and it didn't like either.. ha
undefined says Ah, are you using the latest snapshot?
https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar

Is not very very recent, but it does help.
@Saulman
undefined says I have 128 GB RAM, Ryzen 5950X, ssd nvme raid 0 config..I mean
undefined says Yeah, you are definitely above the min reqs 😅
undefined says I downloaded from here https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar
undefined says Now it's syncing...you think that downloading that tar and restart it can be useful? idk
undefined says Why eligibility API has isSmartwallet check but no eligibility for smart wallet users?
undefined says If you just started syncing, yes.
undefined says Mmm, there are several sources for differences, depending on what exactly you are looking for.
From more general to more specific:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/geth
https://developer.arbitrum.io/proving/wavm-custom-opcodes
undefined says When I finish download it, I just stop the docker and restart it passing that tar instead right? Is there any conflict with the previous data synced until now?
undefined says Oh nice, more than 9 hours to download this tar 🥲
undefined says Is there problem with 'isSmatwallet' check? @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says Also, do I need it to pass in the --init.url flag right?
undefined says Yeah, if you use that flag it will start syncing from there
undefined says I think it's faster to download it first, though
undefined says That's what I'm doing
undefined says 6 hours now, getting better
undefined says But still the sync time for the node is way too slow. How is this possible? I can manage to sync any other blockchain in half a day, and this one it takes days
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs can you please answer my questions, i'm on behalf of smart wallet company using your network.
undefined says Give me a minute, please
undefined says Since March 1st, I've noticed an extremely high ldb file count within nitro/l2chaindata/ directory.  Prior to that date, my node was creating 20-30 files (2MB each) per day and since March 1st, it went to 55K files per day. What settings should I check or what would cause a huge increase in ldb file creation volume?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Any solution for hacked wallet ( bot transfer,)
undefined says This does not include a portion on gasleft(). Offchain should add a note that only L2 gas appears to be returned from the gasleft() function.
undefined says What's the issue you're finding?
undefined says Well, you eligibility API contains isSmartwallet check but there is no eligiblity for airdrop to our smart wallet users. Is your API working fine?
undefined says Few smart wallet companies are pursuing the answer.
undefined says Yeap, API is working fine
undefined says Why is there no eligibility for a  smart wallet users. Can you confirm smart wallet are eligible for airdrop?
undefined says Yes, all wallets have been taking into consideration.
undefined says team looking for any solution regarding hacked wallet ?
undefined says I would have to look more in depth into this, but if you started running your node around that date, it might also be related to the node saving the state of the latest blocks.
undefined says can ı change my l1url for my l2 node?
undefined says Hey, Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to recover the hacked account. We're really sorry about the situation though unfortunately it is out of our hands at this point.
undefined says Yes, you can use  any standard layer 1 node RPC endpoint that you run yourself or from a node provider for `--l1.url`
undefined says Is there any doc for this. My node is running rn btw
undefined says Oh in this case I think you need to gracefully shutdown your node and restart it with the new `--l1.url`
undefined says oh ok thx
undefined says How to add approval / transfer token?
undefined says i want to get my tokens on 23.03 through my node. how to do it
undefined says Can I see the IP of those using my node?
undefined says actually it looks like that is deducted from gasleft() before the function is called and since there is no tx.gaslimit you don't know how much was used
undefined says the command should be like this?
> docker run --mount type=bind,source=/path_of_My_Db,target=/home/user/.arbitrum docker_image
undefined says Maybe the team can give me the answer to this question?
What guarantees does a client have over their transaction's finality in Arbitrum, and how is this finality equivalent to an ordinary Ethereum transaction?
undefined says My non archive node is at 1.6TB -- should resyncing from scratch in theory bring it back down to 1.2TB?
undefined says Please, provide an avenue for us to prove ownership of the account and let us change it.

Please 🥲😞
undefined says It has been running since September.  any other thoughts? Is 1.3TB the correct amount of storage needed to run a node?
undefined says Is mine wrong or not? :arbifrog:
undefined says I did a bridging from ethereum  to arbitrum of USDC and I'm noticing there is also ETH in my wallet, any idea why I also got ETH in my arbitrum wallet when bridging USDC?
undefined says I have other nodes running just under 400GB
undefined says Could it be related to --payload options?
undefined says I'm writing to inquire about the existence of a bug bounty program at your organization. I have discovered a potential security vulnerability in your domain, and I would like to submit a report outlining the vulnerability. If your company is currently operating a bug bounty program, I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with the contact information of your security team so, that I can submit my report and correspond with them regarding this.
undefined says Hey, you cannot transfer the token until the claim day but you can approve third parties to transfer your tokens (like other ERC20 tokens). If you have further questions on how to do this, please post in #📬︱support
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs hey
undefined says do i have enough storage left?
undefined says Please post in #📬︱support
undefined says By default, the RPC interface is only reachable on the localhost of your computer. Have you made it remotely accessible to public addresses?
undefined says There are different types of finality you can rely on depending on your use-case. Once receiving sorting a transactions the Sequencer will publish a message through its real-time feed confirming that it has processed the transaction. This counts as a **soft finality of the transaction**, meaning that the result of that transaction will not change from there on, as long as the Sequencer is trustworthy.
For a **hard finality** you would wait for the Sequencer to post the batch on L1, although that may take a few minutes (in contrast with the soft finality, which is almost instant). Most dApps use the soft finality which is instant by relying on the Sequencer feed for keeping track of finalisation.
You can read more about it here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#sequencing-followed-by-deterministic-execution
undefined says Roughly yes. You'd minimum of 1.2TB SSD (for a non-archival node), But the minimum storage requirements will change over time as the Nitro chain grows. It is recommended to use more than the minimum requirements to run a robust full node
undefined says If you're talking about the pruning, that's what we'll add in the next nitro release
The pruned database will be even smaller but yeah a fresh sync is smaller than continuously running I think
undefined says Please ask in #📬︱support
undefined says Could you send me the tx hash for that transfer you've done?
(you could send me a dm if feels more comfortable!)
undefined says I have gave it to my friends and I wonder can I see their IP addresses
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @Mahsa | Offchain Labs  any thoughts?
undefined says Sent you a friend request
undefined says What I don't understand is that I have other nitro nodes that are sitting happily at 400GB for months. How can that be? I'm pointing this out because maybe there is a bug or something that changes it from a lite to an archive node? My node was running for months then it decided to grow 4x.
undefined says Trying to run a whitelisted defensive validator on local dev node, following docs: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-validator#running-whitelisted-defensive-validator
I run the command: 
```docker run --rm -it  -v /Users/fram3/docker/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url=https://127.0.0.1:8545 --l2.chain-id=412346 --node.validator.enable --
node.validator.strategy=Defensive --l1.wallet.password="SOME SECURE PASSWORD"
```
and i get the error:
```WARN [03-21|16:42:18.574] error connecting to L1   err="Post\"https://127.0.0.1:8545\": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8545: connect:connection refused"
```
I checked that L1 is running, it is launched when starting the local dev node. So what problem could be?
undefined says Gm(x) guys https://twitter.com/app0d14l/status/1638214580567527433?s=46&t=mr1atPWiGzgqhZh4l17xbA

undefined says Hey
undefined says Can someone explain me what is the airdrop ?
undefined says how dapps can check which wallet is eligible for airdrop claim ?
undefined says @3s_drep_fi  and myself just published on Arbitrum research forum the second part of our Challenging Period Reimagined series, as promised.

Our intent is, primarily, to generate a healthy discussion in order to improve optimistic rollups 🙂

Feel free to discuss on the forum or to talk to us directly here in discord

Nice day to everyone! 🙌
undefined says Hey, for the web related issues the best bet would be to issue a PR against the relevant repo and then someone from our team can review.
undefined says I'd check again if those nodes are correctly synced. The nitro full node is def bigger than 400gb now
undefined says We have completed the model for Dynamic Challenging periods by selecting a sequencer and establishing a complete incentive virtuous circle. This model benefits the entire ecosystem, which is why we believe it can be successfully implemented to further accelerate the adoption of Optimistic Rollups.
undefined says This usually happens when your node is still initializing and refuses the connections
undefined says Thank you for this. This one helped https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas#an-example-of-how-to-apply-this-formula-in-your-code. I also submitted a PR for the docs to update the `gasleft()` info. https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-docs/pull/157
undefined says The team will review the PR soon ser!
undefined says Is there any more docs on how this contract works internally? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-os/blob/06b31d21b18b8364c4e97fdabbcf5843326a2345/contracts/arbos/builtin/ArbGasInfo.sol It is kind of magic if you're just looking at it.
undefined says The implementation is here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.go
undefined says I see and I'm assuming this is basically a system contract, i.e. there's not an external party responsible for updating these values. 

Is it auto pulling the calldata?  `// get L1 gas fees paid by the current transaction (txBaseFeeWei, calldataFeeWei)` since those two values are not explicitly passed.
undefined says Well it's a precompile and I don't see any external trxs to update state so I'd say the first is a yes. 

The 2nd I can call it externally in browser where msg.data would not be known so not sure what it's actually doing based on the docs and the implementation provided.
undefined says Peer count on my node effect sync time?
undefined says or not
undefined says exactly, think of it like tx.origin where it's accessing global tx state
undefined says the precompiles have access to a bit more state than the EVM, and this is an example. We provide access to that extra state via methods like `getCurrentTxL1GasFees`
undefined says Amazing. Now if they would just add a tx.gaslimit I could almost definitively calculate how much on chain gas was used instead of having to use a gas buffer to account for changes in total gas used and the initial function call.
undefined says Hey there,

We had some issues recently with gas estimation on Arbitrum Goerli...

I have a flow where eth_estimateGas gets called twice:

1. The first time with just to, from (data and value are both 0), which returns a gas value
2. The second time it's the identical request but it includes the gas value

It looks like the second request is erroring with:
gas required exceeds allowance (81624)


This was a noop (0 value sent to self) in case that matters. Should I be providing a higher figure on a call than what's returned from eth_estimateGas?
undefined says Please guys is arbitrum doing any presale or airdrop currently.
undefined says 
undefined says No this is fake. Please be careful when scammers are trying to bait you with fake “early” claim links and phishing governance applications.
undefined says nitro node does not need peers, it just needs access to a single L1 node and the feed from the sequencer
undefined says Some rpc providers have a cap on the gas param per request in the eth_estimateGas call. Which one are you using?
undefined says Thanks 🙏 guys
undefined says Becareful mate ⚠️
undefined says In arbiscan I can't open the contract tab when I click nothing happens the page doesn't change how to fix it?
undefined says This was on Infura
undefined says And the gas figure that was return in call #1 and included in call #2 was lower than I would have thought it would be: 0x13ed8

Was wondering if maybe this was not an issue of the validation part failing (the second call) but gas being estimate too low the first time? Unsure either way though.
undefined says Any downside to just doubling that estimation to use in the gas limit? It is really important for us that the noop goes through successfully. Or is there some static gasLimit we could include on such transactions that is guaranteed not to be rejected by the sequencer?
undefined says I see, I dont see any downside in adding a buffer to that estimated amount so that you could ensure the tx will go through
undefined says I would like to know why is the rate limit amount from our own private rpc node  is still unknown ? can't you just tell us how many is it ?
also, is there still no docs about the --node.tx-pre-checker-strictness ?
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs Can I ask you why the contract for the airdrop says it will start at block "16890400" while the chain is at block 72M+ ? Is that referring to Ethereum block?
undefined says I don't get how a smart contract deployed on Arbitrum is getting blocks from Ethereum?  `block.number` shouldn't return the current block of Arbitrum chain?
undefined says What address? And why? lol
undefined says Yeah, it does, but in this case it always refusing connection and terminate with: ```Fatal configuration error: too many errors trying to connect to L1: Post "http://127.0.0.1:8545": dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8545: connect: connection refused```
node is active (i can send transactions, deploying contracts..). 
I also can send rpc requests like: 
```curl http://127.0.0.0.1:8545 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```
And i get the results: 
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x1f95a"}
```
Don't know what i'm doing wrong
undefined says Apparently I had to remove all data to start syncing from that snapshot (it ignored it with the data already there). Hope that I did the right thing 😅
undefined says Hey I'm having an issue where I'm getting unexpected ETH from an arbitrum deposit, ethereum -> arbitrum. I'm bridging USDC from ethereum to arbitrum.

Here’s the deposit tx to arbitrum, it’s for USDC, I see some internal transactions  for the wallet that give it ETH, however even those still do not fully account for all the ETH that is now in my arbitrum wallet.  my wallet still has more ETH then it should, any ideas why and where this eth could be coming from?
The ETH balance before the USDC deposit was 0.01226665197517782
undefined says What do you mean rectify?
undefined says When adding --network host flag i get instead:
```
Fatal configuration error: Unknown chain with L1: 1337, L2: 412346.  Change L1, update L2 chain id, or provide --persistent.chain
```
undefined says Could you explain more what you mean?
undefined says No it hasn't
undefined says Connect it where
undefined says @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs does a DAO mean the team stop pushing updates and innovations for arbitrum?
undefined says whats max calldata size one can send nitro txn with?
undefined says @pengman24 DO NOT PM HIM he is not a team member and could be a scammer
undefined says Do not approve anything with your wallet either unless you are aware of what you are approving
undefined says Yea that’s right bro delete the message and stop trying to scam people
undefined says From what I know, all messages sent from L1 to L2 through a delay box alias the msg.sender. So, how can I correctly operate on L1 to call a contract on L2 using the same account?
undefined says Yup I assumed so
undefined says I don't know what is sybil
undefined says I'm eligible to 875 tokens but here's what I got when I log on arbitrum
undefined says Hard refresh

undefined says Like i get you can not take resposibility for people messing up their opsec, but refusing to be helpful with technical info on how to even try to get ahead of the issue around corrupted wallets (which seem to be hundreds at this point) just makes me reconsider even launching any productive venture in this ecosystem fr
undefined says wat about EOA?
undefined says How can i increase the ram cache for nitro ? (as we usually do with some other node with --cache xxxxx ) .
i'm syncing a node, and syncing process is pretty slow, a 3-4 hours process  for 1 day of syncing. i got huge Overpowered server dedicated to arbitrum only for now,  but i realized it's using only 5 GB ram .
undefined says Offchain Labs is still hard at work developing software for Arbitrum, but it’ll be up to the community to vote to approve any changes we, or other people, propose
undefined says wat do you mean pay by my L2 alias address, i think dnt own the alias  in anyway
undefined says could u help me to understand about how alias works when we send msg from L1 to L2, the case is, if the sequence do some bad, so how could i send txn from L1 if the msg.sender has been aliased @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs
undefined says Explained in the docs
undefined says I am running an Arbitrum node locally on my PC with the docker image. It works, but I keep having issues where the ethers.js websocket connection I have to the node stops working so I have to reconnect. Is there a default time where the Arbitrum node disconnects from a websocket after inactivity or something? My program makes a request to the node -> sleeps x mintues -> makes a new request. And after sleeping I often find that my connection no longer works and needs to be reestablished. I dont have this issue with other local nodes such as Geth.
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging
undefined says It’s referring to l1 block
undefined says You need add —network host when you start docker or use local IP address to connect to your geth.
undefined says https://twitter.com/jairogvpro/status/1638349479534383106?t=mHsNADHwRPQePfjgMaZNtw&s=19
undefined says This is because refund, you may pay over l2 gas fee on l1 so it will refund you here.
undefined says Do you want to run arb1 node right? Your l1 must be ethereum mainnet, you need change your l1 chainid and rerun it.
undefined says This way won’t alias your address: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg
undefined says Do you grant the permission? https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#note-on-permissions
undefined says how can i know how much l1 gas use for my transaction ? I dont know why something it very low 100-200k but something 1-4m gas.
undefined says No, this will be responded with "cant help, not our business" instead of actual consideration to at very least help out on ideas to dodge/attempt to frontrun this.

Not sure how this isnt worth an answer but whatever.

Edit: ill export some tx data from the explorer and start mapping this doink out maybe its just not obvious what scale this has

undefined says GM! Why do some blocks have gas limit > 32M(the current upper bound of block gas limit), like block 72312192 and block 72300650 had gas limit > 50M
undefined says Are there any chain data snapshots for arbitrum available?
undefined says to reduce sync time
undefined says I have server in aws. Sync process finished.
But I can't add rpc with public ip. I opened http ports. Same with https. What path should I follow?
undefined says sure I granted
undefined says 32m is for computational gas, which is the l2 part.
undefined says Hmm, if so, Your database might be crushed
undefined says This is December 2022’s snapshot: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says You might right, I'll start from fresh db, thank you

undefined says Can you access via local ip in your server?
undefined says I'm having a lot of trouble trying to import files from nitro into my own project. I'm trying to import the `github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/broadcaster` module. At first I was getting an issue with something down the import chain wanting file files from `solgen/go`, which weren't there. I figured out this was a submodule, so did initialized all the submodules and pointed the go.mod from my project into a local version of nitro. However, now I get a few other import errors:
undefined says `../../nitro/arbos/util/tracing.go:46:17: evm.Depth undefined (type *vm.EVM has no field or method Depth)` for example
undefined says Is there a canonical way to nitro files into other projects that I need to be aware of?
undefined says how is ? I give firewall my ip and anyware ip open http and allowtrafic not connect.
undefined says If you try to build the module, you can see this https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile, it has how to build those.
undefined says So do you open the related node ports? Or just open 80 (http) and 443 (https) ?
undefined says Yeh I've been working my way through the Dockerfile, but as with these things is an endless slog through arcane errors
undefined says I'm not sure if it builds properly on an M1 macbook? Getting some errors now related to x86_64 vs. arm-64
undefined says yes. 8547 and 8548
undefined says putty'say system requte restart. How is stop node ? I can restart server.
undefined says docker stop --time=300 $(docker ps -aq)
undefined says I look there is a testnet for arbitrum one.  Then does the Arbitrum Nova really not exist?
undefined says Do you checkout your the latest master?
undefined says yes
undefined says Arbitrum nova and arbitrum one share the same testnet.
undefined says `a4c1d6121e780b0c4daa9eade6c1a9d7ae244cb6`
undefined says Ah ok
undefined says Couldn’t the 39 day wait time lead to arbitrum technology lead to arbitrum falling behind other L2s?
undefined says how can i stop gracefully my arbitrum node ? i am using services, and when i do a systemctl stop nitro, i always have an unclean shutdown
undefined says i am running an arbitrum full archival node ( nitro + classic ) and geth. Without problems for the last weeks. after a system crash, arbitrum is no longer progressing.
`nitro[2052]: INFO [03-21|13:01:49.130] received error response from L1 RPC      request="{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1188658,"method":"eth_getLogs","params":[{"address":["0x8315177ab297ba92a06054ce80a67ed4dbd7ed3a"],"fromBlock":"0x10117b9","toBlock":"0x10117ba","topics":[["0x5e3c1311ea442664e8b1611bfabef659120ea7a0a2cfc0667700bebc69cbffe1"]]}]}" response="{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1188658,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"failed to get logs for block #16848826 (0x8c385a..26c15f)"}}" err="failed to get logs for block #16848826 (0x8c385a..26c15f)"`

undefined says Do you get any logs after shutting down your node?
undefined says Token is not on the market yet, beware of scams. Claim starts on March 23rd. You can find the contracts here => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says It should be ready. Make sure you don't have any pending txs in your account before the withdrawal. Otherwise, they might help you better in #📬︱support
undefined says @Blob | Safuu  how to raise PR request
undefined says If it is a one-off transaction, it is preferred to use a regular eth deposit and transfer it afterwards. If not, there's a method in the SDK that you can use to perform that operation or just check how it is done => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/assetBridger/ethBridger.ts#L231

undefined says Do you know which address pays the transaction fees  in a setL1BaseFee transaction?
undefined says I have seen some step increase in response time when sending tx to the sequencer over the last week:

A jump from 30ms to 75ms at 2023-03-16 00:00
then increased further from 75ms to 150ms on 2023-03-20 04:00 
and again at 2023-03-20 13:00 from 150ms to 180ms

Was this intentional on your side or a side effect? If the latter, would you be able to look into it for me?

undefined says I want optimize l1 gas use, but i dont know how arbitrum calculate l1 gas. I optimize l2 gas is good but l1 gas too high
undefined says You’d better use this repo: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum
undefined says This is how l1 gas computed: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing
undefined says Maybe you send too many tx at a short period, or you run too many node with the same ip
undefined says You need docker pull that image first.
undefined says ？
undefined says ？
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/batch_poster.go#L577 This should be to sign seqMsg and then serialize it. Will this affect the original data of seqMsg? If it affects, does the client provide a unsign @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says By the way guys, you need to do something about this sync time...every chain sync in less than a day...arbitrum 3+ days that's insane..and that if you start from the most recent snapshot lol
undefined says how can i get L1 blocknumber on arbitrum
undefined says What do you mean by affecting?
undefined says Just call block.number
undefined says That is, will the original data be disrupted? For example, seqMsg is [1,2,3], and then after signature and serialization, it becomes [1,4,2,5,3]; If there is no disruption, it is [4,1,2,3,5], only splicing at the head or tail of the original seqMsg
undefined says Oh, it won’t disrupt the order of tx, and what you see should be anytrust tech, you can find more here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/batch_poster.go So is this for anytrust tech? Not for arbitrum rollup tech.
undefined says Or is it judged to be anytrust or rollup according to the situation of `daWriter`, if `daWriter` is not empty, it is anytrust; Otherwise, it is rollup.
undefined says Nope, the daWriter is das writer, and das is used by anytrust tech, anytrust and nitro share the same codebase.
undefined says When initializing the configuration, if the `BatchPoster` is configured with DAS-related configuration, it is applicable to anytrust; otherwise, it is applicable to rollup.
undefined says yup
undefined says hey guys 🙂 hoping to get some info on this 

sounds like it helps users get the airdrop tomorrow quicker somehow? also just want to confirm it's safe to add to wallet
undefined says In batch_poster.go

`data, err := b.encodeAddBatch(new(big.Int).SetUint64(batchPosition.NextSeqNum), batchPosition.MessageCount, b.building.msgCount, sequencerMsg, b.building.segments.delayedMsg)`

data indicates that L1 Batch is published to L1 in calldata form.

So is there a way to decompress the corresponding data? Or the method of decompressing seqMsg in the corresponding data.
undefined says guys is there any way to speed up the sync process? I'm back 1 month and I need the node synced before the airdrop start
undefined says Why do you need to get it quicker? The difference, if anyone, would be in ms 😅  If it's for dumping faster, I don't think that's gonna help
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Could you please answer me about this? I'm quite desperate..2 days of sync and still 1 month back
undefined says We need 4-7 days to sync because you need read msg from l1 and re-execute them.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbcompress/compress_cgo.go#L19
undefined says How does arbitrum MaxFeePerGas works? Any arbitrum devs / maxxis can enlightnen me?
undefined says No, I mean, get the calldata data and decode it. such as https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbstate/inbox.go#L307
undefined says I don’t think we provide such a tool, but you can see how we process it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbstate/inbox.go#L379 and restruct that function so you can use it.
undefined says Thank you
undefined says We now only have base fee as description: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas , but later we will support extra priority fee later: https://offchain.medium.com/time-boost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy-for-arbitrum-5b3066382d62
undefined says How can a transaction be sped up theoretically?
undefined says Is it purely fifo? So the only way is to send transaction nearest to the sequence node? (As in ping)
undefined says Priority gas fee or otherwise doesn’t work?
undefined says Currently only fifo.
undefined says So no possibility of frontrunning, MeV except by sequencer operators ? Right?
undefined says When I use getTransactionCount to get nonce via my PRC node, it always returns 0; it will return the correct value when I use a third-party PRC node; anyone knows why? Thanks!
undefined says 0x2c51e2cB219240C915850B0AF0e37c747c862063
undefined says No mev on arbitrum itself, but if you use an evil node, it may order your tx and then send those tx to our sequencer.

undefined says You can check your rpc is arb1 or not.
undefined says Im running an arbitrum nitro node and I would like to increase the logging
undefined says any idea how one would do that ?
undefined says I am especially interested in seeing what's going on when sending a transaction to my node
undefined says The auction ends in 10 minutes, can I use block.timestamp?
undefined says I followed the official tutorial to run the arb1 node. But it seems not the arb1 network like you said. The `webRpcUrl` i use is `"http://myServerIP:8547"`.
undefined says Yup, you can add `--log-level=5`
undefined says thanks you very much, will try !
undefined says Could you send eth_blockNumber to your l2 node?
undefined says Yup, I think so, the block.timestamp updates by our sequencer local time.
undefined says 
undefined says thanks a lot
undefined says Which snapshot do you use? And what is your start command?
undefined says The start command:
```
docker run --rm -it  -v /root/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.addr=0.0.0.0
```
 I have tried `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"`, which failed, then I used `--init.empty`, I deleted `--init.empty` when I re-run the start command.
undefined says Oh, you need add —init.url, your state db is not right, maybe you should resync it.
undefined says OK. i will try this flag and resync the state data, thanks a lot!
undefined says I want to deploy Arbitrum archive node. AFAIK two nodes (classic and nitro) are needed to do so. Are there any approximation to their total weigh?
undefined says Does anyone know the pool fee of Arbitrum pairs on uniswap?
undefined says FYI, you only need a classic node if you plan on getting information before block 22207818.
You can find the requirements for running a Nitro node here : https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
For a nitro archive node, you would need at least 2 TB of space.
For a classic node, you would need around 700 GB of space.
undefined says Does Arbitrum Nitro supports parity tracing?
undefined says Nope.
Classic supports parity
Nitro supports debug style calls
undefined says L2就是个笑话，巨大的崩
undefined says Please fix the web
undefined says Can someone help me understand how one can prove inside the L1 what the state (state_root) of Arbitrum is for a given L2 block height. Maybe it is impossible to do via smart contracts? Im looking to feed the results of eth_getProof for a given storage slot inside L1 verification smart contract, thus proving that certain slot had certain value at this height of the L2. The only thing that has to do with state roots that I found is the GlobalState but it has to do with RBlocks. Is there an equivalent for `eth_getProof` for RBlocks - something that can give me the Merkle Tree branch for a given storage slot based on the state_root posted inside the RBlock?
Some context: I am working on https://ethresear.ch/t/wisp-zk-based-cross-rollup-communication-protocol/15059/5 and ideally we would like to integrate the Cross Rollup Communication protocol with Arbitrum. For that we need to prove inside the destination rollup that the L1 knows what the state of Arbitrum is and that certain storage slot is part of it. Hence the question. 
thanks 🙏

undefined says I have a question about the suitability of Arbitrum (or rollups in general) for instant payments. Let's assume I'm selling a real-world item to someone and they send me a payment on Arbitrum. As the recipient of the payment, if I'm happy with trusting the Arbitrum system and the sequencer, is it enough for me to see the transaction in a block produced by the sequencer to consider it final (ie. to hand over the item)? I guess there's nothing the user can do at this point to revert the transaction on L2 (and I'm trusting the rest of the system anyway). Is there still a way I could not get the money (for example by the user "double spending" by triggering an exit on L1, which will be executed before the L2 block gets finalised)? Would be great if anybody could give me some more insight on this. I've read a lot about finality related to L2 transactions, but it's mostly from the perspective of the sender of the transaction. (Please point me to the correct channel if this is not the right one for questions like this!)
undefined says i need some help, i accidentally sent token to its contract. This is that transaction https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xf1c199e24119acca944f993cf7e9b62449972e3a435a5a82b57d998942cbf77f I dont think that it can go back to me but i just want to try..
undefined says If the Sequencer behaves correctly, there's nothing that the user would be able to do after the Sequencer has processed the transaction.
The Sequencer orders transactions, so once a transaction is "ordered" (i.e., processed by the Sequencer and placed in the Inbox), it will be executed before any other transaction that comes afterwards.
So if the user tries to double spend, the second transaction would revert because the first payment takes precedence.
You can read more about it here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle
undefined says Thank you! And the "exit on L1 before the L2 block gets finalised" is also not feasible?
undefined says No. To exit to L1, they will need another L2 transaction that is going to sit after the payment. Also, after that tx, they need to wait for ~7 days to claim on L1: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging
undefined says I see. That's cool, so can it be said that Arbitrum can indeed be used for instant payments? Is there anything that speaks against it (as long as the sequencer is trusted)?
undefined says Not that I can think of
undefined says Alright, very nice, thanks a lot!
undefined says i sent my tokens to your contract address. 2250 tokens  @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st  @roo
undefined says How did you send your tokens there?
undefined says just copied the address of your contract and not the exchange
undefined says Copy the contract address and transfer it. Can I get it back?
undefined says 0xb6D430BFfaA3aEe2De7A9fE77327cdFCE1Fb7076 MY ADDRESS
undefined says How did this happen?
undefined says I don't know how I did it, I probably didn't copy the address of the exchange
undefined says Lovely. So due to the network being broken, I lost my airdrop to the hackers
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs  my address
undefined says is anyone else having issues with their airdrop amounts? mine isn’t registering a point for bridging funds onto nova
undefined says If the team is interested to track or look at this wallet, I can see it's hacked many addresses
undefined says Sorry, unfortunately there's nothing we can do in that case
undefined says never? maybe I could even wait a week when the scammers settle down, prove that this is my wallet? or do nothing?
undefined says hey ser do you think you can help me out?
undefined says No, sorry. It is not possible to send tokens from the token contract.
undefined says 
undefined says sir help me
undefined says Hello! I have made a serious mistake. I have successfully claimed my tokens (625 ARB). Once I had my tokens in Metamask, and when I wanted to withdraw them, I mistakenly sent the tokens back to the distributor wallet (by mistakenly pasting the withdrawal address). Is there a way to recover the tokens? That amount got me out of an economic bind in the short term. I am desolate.
undefined says I cant post here the tx
undefined says but please someone contact me by DM (sorry for my english im spanish)
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Do you speak spanish?
undefined says it says claimed but they show 0 in my wallet? can someone help - i see them on arbiscan but MM shows 0 with the proper contract
undefined says Sorry. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do if the tokens are sent back to the token contract or the distributor.
undefined says sosrry
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says im getting this too
undefined says Is there no way to claim them again, or to send them manually? Does that mean that I have lost my airdrop? I would like to show you the tx
undefined says it says tokens are in my wallet i can see but it says 0 somehting is wrong:
undefined says trying to figur this out too
undefined says 
undefined says it shows my tokens when i go to bridge arbitrum but thats it
undefined says its very strange
undefined says can someone help us here?
undefined says @swimmom sir help
undefined says same bridge shows i have them
undefined says scammers everywhere
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs I had over 250,000$ bridged onto Arbitrum One but only received 7250 airdrop and my panel says I did not qualify at all for even 10,000$ bridge amount, is there a bug? If anyone else has that issue please upvote so this gets noticed, as at the moment it show as I never bridged anything when determining my air drop.
undefined says Guys earlier my account was eligible for the airdrop (when I had checked a few days ago) but now my account isn't eligible anymore? Can someone help?
It's my only official account, so it can't be disqualified due to anything sybil related.
undefined says Same issues lol but I figured it out Dm mate
undefined says caps
undefined says cappers
undefined says just explain here mate
undefined says this is why i didnt want to join arbitrum discord its filled with scammers
undefined says Is there another RPC I can use? I'm getting this error when attempting to send the token to another wallet: 
Transaction decoding is not available for chainId 42161
undefined says Ok
undefined says cause others are having the problem too
undefined says Please use this channel only to ask questions about the Arbitrum protocol. For other queries (claiming, bridging, etc.), please use the #📬︱support channel.
Thanks.
undefined says yes what can we do ? can we bridge to eth?
undefined says Got it. Do you have a contact at support I can notify? For some reason my question is being blocked also.
undefined says its every 30 minutes - why are my tokens showing on the bridge and not on my MM
undefined says First, i sent 4000 token to my address on kucoin exchange to make sure that it was true. The first trans was okay. Then i sent the rest of token (2250 token) but this time i very was careless. When i sent it, I immediately realized it was wrong. Everything happened too fast. I couldn’t do anymore except finding some help here
undefined says Please use this channel only to ask questions about the Arbitrum protocol. For other queries (claiming, bridging, etc.), please use the #📬︱support  channel.
Thanks.
undefined says Is my problem possible to be solved sir? May i ask it in support channel?
undefined says Why are tokens not poisoned from the Metamask anywhere what's the matter ???
undefined says When will they fix it approximately ?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain LabsI would like to ask my wallet token disappeared for a while, but reappeared after a while, what is the situation?
undefined says can you check dm?
undefined says omfg it is IMPOSSIBLE to receive support here
undefined says @Ldd_TripleH have you seen your tokens yet?
undefined says @Ecbert have you been able to claim yet?
undefined says **GUYS IF YOU CLAIMED & ARBISCAN SHOWS SUCCESSFULTX /ARBISCAN SHOWS TOKENS IN YOUR WALLET, BUT IMPORT STILL SHOWS 0 IN METAMASK, JUST WAIT -- MINE FINALLY POPPED UP 90 MINS AFTER CLAIMING**
undefined says My wallet has been compromised and I am looking for a way to send private transactions. I see that flash bots isn’t supported on Arbitrum, is there an alternative I can use?
undefined says how i can submit a fraud proof running a defensive validator in local dev node? Maybe calling ChallengeManager.sol?
undefined says @rtop I sent you a fr
undefined says When pump again 15$😭
undefined says @pankaj1234567 how you seen your tokens yet
undefined says Please help
undefined says Have you resync on mainet api
undefined says @phongcoi have you seen your tokens yet?
undefined says maybe someone can explain to me why my token is transfer to arbitrum foundation
undefined says i have an issue with some stuck transactions that doesn show on the arbiscan and now i cannot do anything
tried to send my tokens to other wallets - didnt work
tried to swap some tokens didnt work
everything is pending and queued and those transactions doesn't show on arbiscan
could you please help me with this?
undefined says need help
undefined says Had this been resolved
undefined says Referred to this channel by an admin as place to discuss choice of validator:
so, are the Galxe, Camelot DAO, and Plutus DAO validators legit assoc with the real entities?
undefined says 0xd491435f1388b7d3646bb7154b95eeb9aea3fd4a hacker
undefined says hey guys, I managed to claim some tokens but everything was buggy at the same time during the drop. My token would appear and disappear but i did know i've claimed it. during the hectic hours i was trying to swap it to L2 eth and may have accidentally lost it there. would there be a solution to this or if you could help me look into it at all? @eli_defi | Arbitrum @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st
undefined says This is what happens to my token .. I have to wait till yesterday but it was resolved today .
undefined says what would i have to do the get it back @MariaDarwin cos it was a lot of token if i do end up losing it. and like there’s a transaction saying it’s been sent to an address that i don’t even recognise or remember sending to. maybe could be the 3rd bridging address idk
undefined says You can wait still hold the mod could reach you . 

Just be care ful of people  dm you.. 

You can send me request.
undefined says Yep just sent u a req, i’ll wait for mods as well
undefined says Is it possible to send a state changing transaction to my watchtower validator or do I need to have an active/staked validator to submit my own transactions to?
undefined says This is what I see on mine
undefined says Another wallet
undefined says does anyone know the answer to what I asked above? Can you send state changing transactions to a watchtower validator?
undefined says how to clear cache in metamask pls
undefined says Is this real. ?
undefined says reset accout only but no fix the problem
undefined says yah, after sync with mobile , can i reset cache on mobile then claim airdrop ?
undefined says thank you very much
undefined says Similar problem
undefined says did you scroll down to the bottom tho?
undefined says Am setting up new wallet
undefined says yo i have issue @eli_defi | Arbitrum
undefined says Please help people who send tokens to arbitrum token smart contract sir
undefined says I did but it. Says claim and delegate. I just want to claim
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum pls give arbitrum users totally to appreciate our community
undefined says anything like that will need to go through a delegate and pass through the governance process
undefined says is there anything we can do if our airdrop amount has been calculated incorrectly?
undefined says The drop is over guys?
undefined says Not yet
undefined says no, airdrop is fixed, contracts already set
undefined says you have up to 6 months to claim
undefined says but I didn't register
undefined says i have 6 points showing in the claim, but i should have 10. my allocation in the claim is equal to 4 points even though it shows 6. is there really nothing that can be done? that’s over half my airdrop…
undefined says Can someone support to check my wallet has stolen
undefined says Someone and by how claimed my token and send out my wallet
undefined says is there any one who can help me because i am having problems with elegibility in the website
undefined says Which wallet are you using?
undefined says metamask. i am using my wallet. it says i am not eligible by mistake
undefined says Did you check if you qualify?? Cos if you are not qualified if will say you are not eligible
undefined says How do we delegate tokens if we claimed from the contract earlier instead of the site?
undefined says Ah never mind just tell me how to get a support ticket lol
undefined says how do i do that?
undefined says Are you using MM?
undefined says no trust
undefined says Okay. Go to setting and press wallet connect
undefined says k
undefined says Let me know when you’ve done that
undefined says done
undefined says What came up?
undefined says pretty sure its connected- discord being weird wont let me send/reply to msg when i want
undefined says Yes same here. Maybe I should call you if they allow that too lol
undefined says u mean through discord, dont think i can no mic i dont think
undefined says im old, gotta go to bed, will try again tomorrow...this really shouldnt be so difficult 😦 ty for your help tho @okoky
undefined says Send me your mail address, I will contact you there since discord is messing up @☠Jekyll.eth
undefined says Fix it now so that you will be free tomorrow
undefined says 🤣 nope too paranoid for that, sorry everyone is a scammer til proven otherwise...thx again for your help tho
undefined says Yeah 🤣🤣… we have to be careful
undefined says 
undefined says I think I will have to explain here then
undefined says It was hacked Please help me. If you look at the wallet address, it looks like other people have been victimized
undefined says anyone here familiar with running their own rpc node that I could bounce some questions off of?
undefined says Even if it’s hacked you can retrieve yoir token back
undefined says Have you try to substantiate your wallet
undefined says is everything good with nova sequencer? I'm getting this error
```

undefined says 0x7EfEcAfc1AF268EF662f110733C8359A8CE04AD9
undefined says I have question about gas limit, how mush is enough to send transaction?
undefined says Does it resume now?
undefined says The gas limit various from each tx, you should call eth_estimateGas for your tx before you send it.
undefined says nope, still seeing this error message.
undefined says Weird, I can connect it from my end.
undefined says hey is there an escape hatch if none of the permissioned validators make any assertions? if they are all offline for example.

once protocol 3 is here i'm less worried about the trust assumptions of liveliness. . . but if all the permissioned validators are offline, no new L2-> L1 messages can be processed. so funds could be locked in the bridge on L1, just not stolen in this manner
undefined says Could you shutdown your node and wait one minute then re-connect?
undefined says Nope, validator must make assertion to insect the proof to the bridge. This is the reason why we are continuing to expand our validator size.
undefined says i tried, but still getting the same error 😦
```

undefined says the spam filter is heightened due to increased spam, @shotaro feel free to dm any filtered message lol
undefined says When the support channel back open? I have some issue
undefined says regarding this
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/5e9f4228e6418b114a5aea0aa7f2f0cc161b67c0/contracts/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol#L34-L63
if validators are offline more than 7 days, the whitelist can be disabled
undefined says 
undefined says What issues?
undefined says How long does it take to sync archive classic+nitro nodes?
undefined says my wallet  was stolen  ? can i challenge  ?
undefined says 
undefined says wish more had been done about sybil farmers
undefined says Why some people's tokens sent back to arbitrum foundation wallet ?  Any have reasoning
undefined says you see big accs on debank doing this blatantly... they hijacked the distribution aim of it... wish something is retroactively done.
undefined says Seems if your ip over a cloudflare determined “threat score” or something else judged as spam, so it cause this, you can wait for some times and retry.
undefined says how can i send a signed eoa transaction from L1?
undefined says Classic node we have snapshot (https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar), and it may take 4-7 days to sync the nitro node.
undefined says We have a tutorial related to this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg
undefined says so its just calling sendL2Message with signedTx type message and encoded signed tx data?
undefined says Yup
undefined says How does ordering of txs go when sequencing? Direct sequencer txs first or delayed inbox txs first? and how does it read the delayed inbox txs? if current eth block number is N when constructing block Y, does it read `N - X` ethereum block's delayed inbox txs?
undefined says Co ask
undefined says You can find those information here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#inboxes-fast-and-slow
undefined says > A well-behaved Sequencer will typically release delayed messages after about ten minutes, for reasons explained below.
Specifically what does "after about ten minutes" look like in the actual implementation?
undefined says It’s depends on network, each time sequencer send batch it will read some delayed inbox message and include them: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L382
undefined says Can anyone point me to docs for how to sync an archive Arbitrum node?
undefined says What kind of node you want to sync using archive mode?
undefined says A node which contains the entire state trie and can respond to RPC calls in historic blocks
undefined says If it is nitro node, you can just add `--node.caching.archive`, if you want to sync classic node, you can run with `--node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000`
undefined says If so, you should run both type of node
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says Thank you! 🙂
undefined says You can see docs here, but you need add `--node.rpc.classic-redirect=<classic node RPC>` to your nitro node.
undefined says Here is how to run a classic node: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node
undefined says Tokens allocations from DAO projects needs to be claimed or will be airdropped directly to the treasury contract?
undefined says Is there a grant program on arbitrum?
undefined says Hey everyone! I was running archive arbitrum node. When i restared the node, it is stuck at "latest l1 block is old" and it isnt creating any new block. Before restart it was creating blocks! Please help! What could be the reason? Thanks!
undefined says How can i post my question here? It says its blocked content. And I really don't know why...
undefined says Attaching my question because I can't post ("blocked content" error)
undefined says I don't see a way to check
undefined says 8PRNNFEGVDKUH5WJ 0xa211c6f681a3f06ed0130dfb305602f54c26726f
undefined says Is your L1 node syncing correctly?
undefined says Some words get filtered out by the bot: h i, g m , h e l l o and similar words
undefined says tx.gasprice will be the price bid you sent with the transaction. If you want to see the actual price used, you can get the transaction receipt and read the field `effectiveGasPrice`
undefined says Can some admin please let me post my issue? It is getting blocked but doesn't say why...
undefined says I removed the greetings stuff... And got slow mode punished ...
undefined says Some words are getting filtered out. I'm going to ask about the current configuration.
undefined says In the meantime, can you send an image with the question? (Sorry about that)
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says What does a validator do to submit a fraud proof? How does the challenge start?
undefined says Can you send the docker run command you're using to run the node?
undefined says You can find information on how fraud proof works in these sources:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/assertion-tree
https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#resolving-disputes-using-interactive-fraud-proofs
undefined says 
undefined says Alright bot is in "war mode" still since yesterday. Sorry about that. You can send the command on DM too if you want.
undefined says Now I got warned for posting a link 🙈  So next pic it is...
undefined says Have you restarted your node since this happened?
undefined says Thanks, i've already read these sources, i want to understand how the mechanism works technically. I suppose the validator calls the methods that are present in the contract ChallengeManager.sol, correct?
undefined says Not since that screenshot. But it happened yesterday as well. So I updated to the 2.0.11 image but problem did stay.
undefined says Does arbitrum team hire interns in China?  @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Are re-orgs/unwinds are possible? If so, is db transactional?
undefined says Let me take a closer look into this and I'll get back to you
undefined says Thank you so much
undefined says L2 reorgs are possible but very unlikely to happen. L1 reorgs might happen, but the only consequence will be that certain L1->L2 message might be missing, that's why the Sequencer will always for L1 to be finalized before relaying the message to L2.
undefined says Is Metamask the only wallet failing? Have you tried sending other txs through the node?
undefined says do you know tommy18?
undefined says Is that a user?
undefined says he told me
undefined says he told me he is support team for this discord
undefined says Can you tag the user, please? Or send its ID
undefined says tommy18
undefined says @Tommy
undefined says Thanks for reporting. That user is not from the team.
undefined says It's been banned.
undefined says And what about db transactionality? Is next scenario possible?:
1) Data fetching started (like logs or something else)
2) Some data fetched
3) Reorg occurred and data changed
4) More data fetched
5) Finally we have "mixed" data with re-orged and true information
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I tried several transactions via MetaMask; all of them failed (MM keeps the tx pending, so I have to reset MM in order to use it again).
Transactions via Frame worked.
The `Gas estimation capped by limited funds` warning appears in any case.
undefined says I found a problem with metamask standard rpc, the infura url doesn’t work, json rpc failure, looks like you need API key to perform the call function now, you need to manually put “ ht tp s:// arb1 “dot” arbitrum “dot” io/rpc” “tell mr meeseeks to stop censoring arbitrum url links pls, this goes in your network setting. This is a serious problem for functionality, most ppl don’t know what this is Br Henrik
undefined says Are MM or other wallets working with Nitro w/o any issues on your end?
undefined says It’s a link to arbitrum rpc smart ass ❤️ also I want to be better at golf, can you help me 🥹
undefined says At least it doesn't instant ban you for using inappropriate language 😂
undefined says True true 🤣
undefined says Reorgs are very unlikely to occur. It hasn't happened yet, iirc.
Your scenario would be theoretically possible, although unlikely.
If you're trying to be absolutely sure you won't have mixed data, you can always wait until the tx has fully finalized on L1 => https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle#3-sequencer-posts-transaction-in-a-batch-on-chain

Also, if you share more information on the problem you're trying to solve, we might be able to better help you.
undefined says We haven't received any other issue similar to yours, afaik.
One question, do you have predetermined gas params set on Metamask?
undefined says I tried with proposed defaults as well as manual settings. Both didn't work.
undefined says Not sure anyways it's the gas as the warning gets issued as well when using Frame. But with Frame the tx gets processed, with MM it doesn't.
undefined says What is the correct channel to ask this?
undefined says , I just deployed a contract to mainnet but I get this error whenever I try to verify contract

Error! Unable to verify source code
Exception err_code_1 Occured: ERROR - Unable to connect to the remote server

@Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs
undefined says Any help ? @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says asking arbiscan
undefined says Alright thanks so much , I’ll be waiting, cause have been in this for over 3 hours
undefined says Can I go ahead now ?
undefined says anyone else seeing RPC issues on when using MM?
undefined says tried various ones but none seem to fixing the issue
undefined says 
undefined says Hey frens, is there a snapshot for Nova? And would the flow be same as in the docs only need to put 42170 as l2 chain id?
undefined says Like 75% of the time I try to deploy onto arbitrum goerli nowadays it is an awful experience
undefined says I am having RPC issues with my forge scripts and I am using QuickNode
undefined says this is for developers
undefined says Can you please fix this? It is a huge blocker for my entire team that we can not deploy onto your test network
undefined says This is the problem
undefined says @Innbuld fixed
undefined says Still broken for me
undefined says 
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs why my message is blocked ?
undefined says i probably wrote a blacklisted word. but don't know which one. it's a very standard message
undefined says For what I see, this warning appears when an estimation is requested including a gas price (which might be Metamask and Frame sending a gas price to the node). What throws me off is Metamask not sending the signed transaction to the node after this warning. Have you tried sending a tx directly through the node without using Metamask or Frame? (If not, it's ok, I just want to know if the problem comes from Metamask)
undefined says There is no snapshot for Nova. It doesn't need a genesis snapshot because it has always used the same stack.
undefined says "H i", "g m", "h e l l o" and other greetings are blacklisted
undefined says No, I haven't. Where can I find the command to do so (or do you have one at hand I can give try)?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Do you have any comment on why your testnet constantly fails for me? And other developers as well. There are times when it does and times when it doesnt. When it does it is impossible to interact with the chain. Why is this happening? Do you even notice any of my messages in here?
undefined says Don't worry about it. If you use another RPC, Metamask works correctly?
undefined says 
undefined says lol I have been warned for posting the issue in the forge repo. I'm really not sure what you mean by don't worry about it. This is a big blocker for my entire team, so it isn't really possible to not worry about it.
undefined says My colleague is looking into it and I see he already wrote to you on GH
undefined says Well that would have been good to know instead of "don't worry about it" after a few days of silence
undefined says That message was a reply for the user above you, ser 🙂
undefined says Well I suppose I'm just a little bit frustrated after days of being ignored about it. I just tried another RPC and no, same problem
undefined says Yes, with other RPCs Metamask works.
undefined says i d m e d you
undefined says Is there a protocol for locking liquidity on arbitrum?
undefined says Btw, is your node fully synced?
undefined says Check out hedgey finance. Can't post links in here...
undefined says Please help
undefined says Looks like they do time locked token distribution and escrow but not specifically liq lock
undefined says Is your wallet bringing this or what?
undefined says Correct. Similar to team finance, but available on Arbitrum.
undefined says will the sequencer at some point be permisionless and decentralized? will the token be used for this in the future? what are the plans regarding it?
undefined says I can't ask my question, i don't know why.
undefined says A rb  CA 
Anyone?
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st @roo  what are the workd we can not use ? i try to ask a question and i am always blocked. i konw the H e l l o etc.. but please check my message
undefined says What's objectionable about this?
undefined says who have the answer to this ?
undefined says No idea why such message is not allowed 😄 ?
undefined says is there any way to unwind blocks or something like that? What can I do if my node is stuck after "feed connected"!
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Can you help me with one question? I was running my own RPC node for Arbitrum and since it requires L1 RPC to run, I was using public RPC Eth. During high load in the blockchain I was getting the error "429 Too Many Requests: {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":429,\"message\":\"Public RPC Rate Limit Hit, limit will reset in 60 seconds\"}"
I would like to understand if this error is coming from an increased load on the Sequencer or from the L1 RPC ?
undefined says I get this error on Testnet and no idea how to debug it. Any suggestions?

`creation of TestToken errored: Returned error: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":"[ethjs-query] while formatting outputs from RPC '{\"value\":{\"code\":-32603,\"data\":{\"message\":\"Internal Server Error\"}}}'","id":4932855208417590}`
undefined says Disconnect and connect wallet again.
undefined says Tried, same error 😦
undefined says scammer do not
undefined says Do not ask for help from anyone that’s not part of the team @bat
undefined says I need your help sir
undefined says You did send back to Arbitrum CA right ?
I think the team is already in talk with stakeholders involved
undefined says i bought it on binance and i wanted to send it to aveai wallet... but i was wrong, because i entered the address contract... which should be the wallet address , does that mean my coins can't go back to my wallet?
undefined says I do doubt if you can get it back
undefined says Oke thank.. verry sad for beginner 🥹

undefined says I'm having difficulty finding ARG and WETH token contracts on the Goerli Testnet. 
Anyone happen to know their contract address on there?
undefined says Are you saying my own L1 RPC won't help?
undefined says Quick question here please. I have some Arbitrum Ethereum in my wallet. Can it still be used for gas fee on Arbitrum or I need to convert it to the new Arbitrum token to pay fees?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Yes
undefined says Yes
undefined says Any further information how/when new validators are onboarded?
undefined says What's your issues
undefined says No issue,but interested in being a Arbitrum Validator
undefined says How did you solve it?

undefined says i posted that in #general but it went under in no time ... anyhow .. i would be really sweet ... ... if we could split the delegations ... in my case i would like to delegate some to a trusted 3rd party delegator but remain some voting power to myself ...
undefined says For the tokens allocations from DAO projects, do we need to submit a treasury address?
undefined says The error message you're encountering suggests that the initialization mode is not specified, and the expected chain data is not found in the expected directory. Follow this directory i’m about to send
undefined says 
undefined says Make sure you have properly installed Arbitrum and its dependencies. You can follow the official installation guide provided by the Arbitrum team: developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/installation (add the https at the beginning)
undefined says Initialize the node with the appropriate parameters. You should use the --init flag along with other required arguments. A common command for initializing an Arbitrum node is:

arbitrum-node --init.from=CONFIG_PATH --init.token=YOUR_TOKEN --init.blocktime=BLOCK_TIME --init.sequencer-lifecycle=SEQUENCER_LIFECYCLE --init.rpcport=8547
undefined says Replace CONFIG_PATH with the path to the config JSON file, YOUR_TOKEN with your (Ether  priv key), BLOCK_TIME with the desired block time (in seconds), and SEQUENCER_LIFECYCLE with the sequencer lifecycle (e.g., 'alwaysSequencer').
undefined says @Love SafePal
undefined says After initializing the node, start the Arbitrum node by running the following command:

arbitrum-node --datadir DATA_DIR_PATH
undefined says Replace DATA_DIR_PATH with the path to the directory where
undefined says Please send me the directory in pvt
undefined says Okay sir
undefined says i have devoted a lot to the mainnet operation, now you tell me it's only because of your automated bots that scans no accounts and excludes me from the airdrop, i need a clear explanation about that, I'll accept it, but I need transparency
undefined says I've tried deploying uniV2 contracts on arbitrum goerli testnet using hardhat but I permanently get a failure at estimating gas transaction. It worked pretty well on all the other networks I tested. I was wondering if that's a common issue or if arbitrum-goerli was somehow different? Thanks a lo
undefined says Hey guys,
Just have some questions about the validators.
As I see in the documentation, only whitelisted wallets can become a validator.

Why would they do it? Do they generate some kind of revenue? Can people stake in them?

About L3 chains, how would the validators work? >1 validator for each L3? Or the L2 validators will work for every L3 too?

Thanks in advance
undefined says validators are generally players that are invested a lot on the chain, so they want to know instantly that the chain is posting the right status, and they will react in case the sequencer or the batch poster goes rogue for example. They are probably a money losing business: there hasn't been a single challenge. If there happens to be an invalid assertion, then they will get some revenue, as they will get half the stake of the loosing party in the challenge game.
undefined says Hey, the gas usage on arbitrum not only include execution but also the amount to post the calldata to l1, you can see how it works here: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says Just add `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"` to your start command.
undefined says You can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L71 , if the return > 0, it won’t rollback (unless l1 rollback)
undefined says What's error with my node sir? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs

undefined says Can you check your disk usage?
undefined says Perhaps this reason.

undefined says How will the sequencer be affected by the validators? Will each one have its own?
undefined says i'm still seeing HTTP 403s when accessing nova feed sequencer.

This is from a pod inside our cluster. I tried to curl that endpoint and I'm seeing some cloudflare challenges. I don't think the client can handle this resulting to the errors above. Is there any way around this?
undefined says how to swap using uniswap v3  on arbitrum using nodejs
undefined says The same as ethereum mainnet, you could see how to interact with them through their docs.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs how can i bypass the cloudflare challenge on the arbitrum sequencer feed?
undefined says How many nodes are you running, do you do anything’s on it?
undefined says thx bro, I will try later
undefined says i'm running 2 nodes, we are not doing anything yet since we are waiting for it to sync
undefined says Maybe not, but if you give me your IP address I can provide you the reason why you got block, you can dm me this.
undefined says 
undefined says Hey guys, do you plan to instrument arbitrum node to integrate streamingfast firehose? This would drastically improve data availability
undefined says Understood, thank you so much
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I have a question related to transaction 0xf9c421f79ef3fee7a04523fb8568c86ea62f56a281f31b69e8f8564727321b5f which was minted 3 days ago and seems to be in an Arbitrum Classic block, whereas it should be an Arbitrum One block. How is this possible?
undefined says Any idea why you think it is a classic tx?
undefined says Hmm, I thought so since Arbiscan shows Advanced tx info, and this tab was only present for Classic blocks when last I checked. It seems that the interface has changed.
undefined says Ah yup, arbiscan now also support nitro’s `advanced info` tag.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs is there a more recent snap-shot for Arbitrum one? This one "nitro-recent.tar" has ~44m blocks but it's taking so long to get to head of chain ~75m
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  I have a question about rate limit. I'm running my own nitro node, and the parameters are like this: 
        - --l1.url=xxxxx/<API KEY>
        - --l2.chain-id=42161
        - --http.addr=0.0.0.0
        - --ws.addr=0.0.0.0
        - --http.vhosts=*
        - --http.corsdomain=*
Q1:  the error "arb1-sequencer rate limit hit" is because the sequencer was busy, and I can do nothing with it, right?
Q2: the error: "Public RPC Rate Limit Hit, limit will reset in 60 seconds" means  the l1.url  is busy, right?
undefined says Both of them are l2 things, I am confirming the rate limit with our sre team, will revert to you.
undefined says you need to tell your team to subscribe to Twitter Verified cause Arbitrum account is shadow banned on Twitter and if you search Arbitrum you only see spam accounts!
undefined says How can I prune my node? Its at 1.2TB already...
undefined says Arbitrum twitter account is https://twitter.com/arbitrum, it should not banned, also thanks for your suggestion.
undefined says We should have manually prune in the next version.
undefined says Last night I just made a terrible error and transferred 1.5 ETH to the USDC Arbitrum contract address on mainnet in two transactions. I'm not sure if I can post links but txns below: 

0x64562b8cbd70df8019bffc6644ceaa48f2b32ad5dca4376ca356b30815803569
0x362c766a924771514dd9663a410e3a80d05c495a5466dac9ac6ec6eacb871806

Sorry I wasn't paying attention and normally am much better! Been a tough few weeks. So stupid :/ 

Is anyone from Offchain Labs able to help? Is there a better channel to post this in?
undefined says Sorry, we can’t rollback the tx.
undefined says Argh shame, thanks for at least clarifying so i can move on. It's a lot of money for me
undefined says Is it because you can't access the contract?
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks in advance!
undefined says Anyone any idea why gas prices on Arbitrum Goerli are outrageaus atm.... 600 gwei lol...
undefined says our test setup is breaking because we can't get our hands on enough goEth to keep it alive 😦
undefined says Has mainnet been upgraded to version 2.0.12?
undefined says the same question
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs do you know if there is any more recent nitro tar? latest i found has 44m blocks only
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says i want to fetch data information for arbitrum nova

is enough to run a node as in the documentation from arbitrum io -> run a node tutorial?

because is not clear for me what is the difference betwee arbitrum one and arbitrum nova
apparently you have pools in both sides likes two blockchains and that is confusing for me

Waiting for an answer
thanks
undefined says thanks! please check your inbox regarding this
undefined says do arbitrum nodes support some kind of prunning? Im running out of storage
undefined says my node reached 1.6 TB in size for the data directory, is this normal or is there something wrong? this looks like way too much for me
undefined says my node grew +100Gigs over the weekend, too weird
undefined says Administrator, when I receive the airdrop coin, there is an error. If there is no success, I will show that I have finished it. How can I solve it? Thanks
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Hey team, i'm working on calculating ETH balance for Arbitrum address. May I know why this address received 100 ETH via internal_tx about 100 days ago and it has an ETH balance of 0? he didn't send to anyone. 0x32439338e10c64c015a8920cd4b5ce59e9ee7c96
undefined says 
undefined says I didn’t get the airdrop coin, please help me solve it, thank you
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st I didn’t get the airdrop coin, please help me solve it, thank you
undefined says Are you eligible?
undefined says what is wrong with Arbitrum? over the weekend my data directory increased 100 Gigs of space. Just to verify I am not running an archival node I did a balance get at block 7M and received a "missing trie node" , so my config is not archival node. How it is possible that the data directory is growing so fast? This looks like a mistake somewhere in the data storage functionality.
undefined says related question is I used nitro-recent.tar and it only has 44m blocks, and after 48 hours it only reached 46m is that normal speed (30 GB ram + 16 CPU)? also is there a more recent snapshot?
undefined says Hi:)
undefined says @aram.eth I'am also interested in a more recent snapshot @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says How can i speed up the sync?
undefined says Same question, I wonder if it's hardware resource constraint (like RAM) or network, or it's just how slow it is, therefore a more recent snapshot should be helpful!
undefined says more recent snapshot 🙏
undefined says how can i get eth on testenet? 0,1 eth isnt enough for anything😖
undefined says Sorry you mean L2 gas price is reached 600 gwei or Goerli itself?
undefined says yes it reached 600 gwei on l2 (Arbitrum Goerli, not the goerli testnet)
undefined says 
undefined says 0x3a61348a92dd3945b45ff507c8c524aaa98ee4ac946d091a330aafa63289ea10 --> tx hash example on goerli arbitrum
undefined says Will take a look at it. Thanks for the report. Usually it shouldn’t get to this numbers unless there’s a huge demand. 
Note that on Arb goerli gas price change is much faster than Arbitrum one itself because of our config there
undefined says This is the latest snapshot we have rn
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs would you please upload a newer one?
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs I would like to know if Arbitrum is planning to instrument their node to integrate streamingfast firehose. Who is the most suitable person to ping to discuss that matter ?
undefined says Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One are two different chains. If you just want to gather data from Nova, you need to set parameters discussed here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#required-parameter
To be:
L1: Ethereum L1 RPC
L2 chain ID: 42170
undefined says Not for now. But we’re working on supporting pruning in near future
undefined says There should a new snapshot soon. We’re working on a solid plan to have regular snapshot updates
undefined says Does anyone have a node I can temporarily use for some testing? My node had troubles and I have to resync. Let me know
undefined says You’re running Archival node right?
undefined says Where can trade and  add LP on Go3rli testnet?

undefined says I can't receive my tokens via airdrop. Removing and adding a network, browser, operating system does not help. There are enough funds to pay for gas.  Help solve this problem. How to fix the problem?
undefined says Where can i make lp? didnt undetstand your answer
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st Asked to write about this problem in your channel
undefined says when the sequencer be decentralized? Is there any timeline for this?
undefined says pls allow my previous message @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs .

automod its not working properly.
undefined says im not sure if this is the right spot. I developed a 2D side scroller/top-down RPG and now im trying to amke a website and learn how to inject web3 (wallet connecting to website) I know nothing about web3 dev websites. Anyone got any recommendations where to start and or github examples I could study and self teach?
undefined says I have solidity experience with developing tokens for some small projects so im not a complete amature but nonetheless eager to get on with web development and learn more
undefined says no, I am not running archival node, if I call eth_getBalance() I am getting "missing trie node" error , this can't happen with archival node
undefined says Hey, I would like to run an archival node.

As I know, I should run both classic and nitro, right?

How can I run these together? I think I saw the document before, but I can't seem to find it now.
undefined says What errors you get?
undefined says There is no tl for this.
undefined says It seems you should have run your node for a long time. We will have manually prune enable in the next version that will help you reduce the storage usage.
undefined says You should run both nitro and classic archive node: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node , run nitro archive node (`--node.caching.archive`), run classic archive node (`--node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000`), also you need add `--node.rpc.classic-redirect=<classic node RPC>` to your nitro node so it can redirect request to classic node.
undefined says You can also do it through ui: https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap
undefined says I see. If I want to run both in the same server, I should customize the port right?
undefined says I’m having trouble getting the full list of my transactions from arbiscan. It's showing 1,383 transactions but when I go to look at the last page, I get an error "There are no matching entries." Then when I download a full csv export, it only shows 824 records.
undefined says Yup
undefined says How about directly use their api to download?

undefined says It sounds like db corruption, do you still have your tar file? Could you untar it again?
undefined says yes
undefined says Wen is support opening tickets? They picked my weak wallet and not my one with more points

Pretty lame or will they fix this? Only a couple hundred bucks different but that’s a lot to me right now
undefined says Can you help me with an issue I have?
undefined says Check your dms, sir.
undefined says my poster raise error "DataPoster failed to send transaction    err="exceeds block gas limit" ", how can i fix it?
undefined says I have faced this issue before as well
undefined says One potential solution is to increase the gas limit for your transaction. 
Or
Use a Different DataPoster
undefined says Different DataPoster?  What are differences?
undefined says 
undefined says cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit

In the brouser console writes:
MetaMask - RPC Error: Internal JSON-RPC error.

message: "Internal JSON-RPC error."
undefined says Using a different node to attempt your transaction
undefined says you may need to manually adjust the gas limit for your transaction in order to ensure that it has enough resources to execute properly.
undefined says can i deploy two poster?
undefined says Yes sure, , you will need to ensure that both posters are properly designed and coded in order to avoid any issues during deployment.
undefined says How do I do it in the metamask in step 1 where I just sign the transaction?
undefined says At the bottom of the transaction window, you will see a dropdown menu labeled "Gas Fee."

Select the "Advanced" option from the dropdown menu.

This will reveal more options, including the "Gas Limit." Use the slider or input field to adjust the gas limit for the transaction
undefined says Your tx will revert due to `ERC20Votes: invalid nonce`, I guess your browsers cache not update causes this, could you clean your browser cache and try again?
undefined says What nodes you are running? Are you running local devnet?
undefined says i deploy nitro on testnet
undefined says i deploy nitro on testnet
undefined says Hey, when did classic change to nitro? Which block height?
undefined says Hey all!
My node won't start anymore as of this morning...
`ERROR[03-28|08:47:45.131] error creating blocks                    err="leveldb: not found"`
Any idea what might be causing this? I just got done watching the paint dry for 4 days as this thing synced, only to wake up to this.
This is in a docker container, running image `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec`
undefined says Nitro upgraded 2.0.12
I'm not sure if it works, but try upgrade.
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/1088918653765955784
undefined says Thanks for pointing me to the update! I'm still getting the error though I'm afraid.
undefined says Check for bugs or issues with the Nitro Node image or version:
undefined says Check if the leveldb database file exists: You can do this by checking the path specified in your Docker run command or compose file. If the file does not exist, you may need to restore it from a backup or re-sync the node from scratch.

This are the few ideas 💡 I have on this mate @lockesmith
undefined says Is that a specific file, or the whole db? I can see that the db exists. I just got done re-syncing the node from scratch, it finished last night and immediately went to this. As per @Jiwon | All That Node | DSRV's suggestion I just upgraded from `v2.0.11-8e786ec` to `v2.0.12-65d4e7a` so I think it's safe to say that it's not an issue with the image.
undefined says `error creating blocks                    err="leveldb: not found"`

Usually this error message appears when the data corrupted in my experience. You can wait the message of the foundation person. But I would recommend to sync again.(It always work faster for me.) It is hard to find out why or which data corrupted for ldb.
undefined says Check file permissions: Make sure that the database directory has the correct permissions for the Docker container to read and write to it. If the permissions are not set correctly, this could also cause syncing issues.

This is another method to trouble shoot the issue
undefined says Would you happen to know if there's a more recent snapshot than the one in the docs? That's the one I used and it took much longer to sync than expected. I'd really hate to go through that again only to find out that it's got bad data.
undefined says First nitro block was 22207818
undefined says Can you send the command you used to run the node? It looks like something happened to the DB, but let's first verify that the command is correct.
undefined says (Thanks mastermind and Jiwon for your help 🙂 )
undefined says The latest snapshot is https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar (it's a bit old already, but more recent than the genesis one)
undefined says 
undefined says The bot won't let me post my run command... Is there another method other than pasting it in chat?
undefined says Oh, right. You can paste an image or you can send me a DM (I'll reply back in this chat anyway)
undefined says Hey
Is there a seperate discord for nova?l
undefined says Then `arbitrum_avm_block_height` of classic node won't increase by 22207818, will it?
undefined says Fr req sent
undefined says It won’t, you should run nitro node to continue sync.
undefined says Same here.
undefined says Just send me the message, it should let you do that
undefined says It does not
undefined says Wdym, are you using this guide: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node ?
undefined says Alright, a couple of questions:
- Does `/data/arbitrum`  exist and can docker write in it?
- Is your L1 node running correctly and synced?
- Has the L2 node been running ok until today? And was it in sync?
undefined says yes
undefined says - the directory exists and docker can write
- it is running and synced
- L2 just finished syncing over night, I woke up to this state
undefined says Thanks. Did it shutdown after an error? If so, do you get the exact same error after running it again? (Btw, you don't need the --init flag if the node is synced)
In any case, please send some more lines of log if possible to see if there's any underlying issue that could have caused the db corruption.
undefined says the batch transaction's estimateGas is 30,049,744. how can i decr it?
undefined says It didn't shut down, but I did also wake up to an L1 failure. I honestly attributed it to the L2 as it worked before the sync finished and is still working now. But I didn't think to note what that error was. I may have to go through the process again to reproduce that... You said the snapshot in my run command is the most recent?
undefined says This one is more recent => https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar
undefined says That will at least make this process more painless lol

Sent the full run log
undefined says It looks like some corruption happened, judging by the `input/output error`  message. Best you can do is retry syncing, yeap.
It's interesting that an L1 failure might have caused this, though.
If resyncing from that snapshot works, please let us know 🙂
undefined says I'll try a sync from that snapshot. I'll also make an effort to see which comes first if it happens again and collect more data if needed. Thanks for your effort!
undefined says There is no way to set the amount of gas for payment
undefined says I even restored my wallet on my mobile device, but that didn't help either. Then I restored it to another wallet, that didn't help either.
undefined says Maybe I was accidentally included in some kind of black list of addresses that cannot be accessed by this contract?
undefined says It actually starts here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupUserLogic.sol#L279 . And that function calls the ChallengeManager.
There's another source with very good information here (that section and the one below) => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro#the-rollup-chain
undefined says If I understand the rollup protocol correctly RBlocks are posted to L1. Is there an RBlock explorer or something like that?
undefined says Wiped my data and tried to rebuild using image `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.12-65d4e7a` but ran into this error: `couldn't create jwt secret               err="open /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/jwtsecret: no such file or directory" fileName=/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/jwtsecret` I rolled back to `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec` and it started up without issue. Any insight on what I'm missing from my run command for that?

Also, my L1 crashed again, so I think it's more likely that came first in this whole mess. It was giving an io error and it looks like something happened and caused my disk to throw and error and set to read-only. I'm guessing that issue is the root culprit in all of this.
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs which block height? i already have a node in sync process i need to know if i will speed up or not with that one please
undefined says Fr req and msg sent
undefined says Thanks for reporting about the L1 crash.
About the error on 2.0.12, the only thing I can think of is whether the right permissions are set. Other than that, I'm not sure what could cause that error in .12 and not in .11 .
Were maybe some leftovers from the previous instance of the node? Or did you remove the whole volume?
undefined says 44M iirc (from December)
undefined says thanks! I started yesterday with the 22M one!
undefined says how long should we expect to fully sync? is it expected like ~14 days? that's how long it looks to be taking (on 30GB + 16 CPUs + SSD)
undefined says 
undefined says from 44M snapshot i think that ~4 days,  at last that's what I'm seeing in my node monitoring while syncing
undefined says I have the volume mapped to a directory, I just erased the whole dir when I started over, nothing residual that I saw.
undefined says hmm I see, for me it's doing like almost "one/two L1 blocks per second" which is best case 8-9 days... it's normal then fine, but was wondering how others are experiencing, thanks for sharing 🙂
undefined says That was my exact experience. 4 days syncing only to have my disks unmount and seemingly corrupt my L2 and now I'm starting over. My head hurts 😵‍💫
undefined says 
undefined says initializing everything with `v2.0.11-8e786ec` to generate the jwt file then stopping the service then starting again with `v2.0.12-65d4e7a` looks to have worked. I'm not sure if it's a bug, or it requires a new flag with the new version.

undefined says Hey guys, I thought Arbitrum tx sequencing was FCFS, so basically no frontrunning was possible, but I just saw this on an pair (0x97bca422ec0ee4851f2110ea743c1cd0a14835a1). 

How is this possible ? Not sure if it's a sandwich attack though, it doesn't seem profitable, but I wonder what that is then
undefined says is there some tutorial on how to create my own snapshots? just compress the nitro data folder?
undefined says how do i lower gas fees to launch my token?
undefined says 
undefined says any help with that transaction pending for 3 days
undefined says yes nothing
undefined says Hey, yes Arbitrum processes the txs in a FCFS manner so front-running is technically infeasible. 
Screenshot does not sound alarming (in terms of frontrunning attacks eg sandwich attack) to me
undefined says Can you dm me your address so that I can look into this?
undefined says Hey, yes the snapshot is just a copy of the database of the nitro node, basically nothing more than just making a backup of the correct directory
undefined says same problem here, did you get some help ?
undefined says Can you dm me your address so that I could take a look?
undefined says Im having the same issue. Ill send as well
undefined says Yeah I think their indexer also has some problems too, so not alarming
undefined says This should be fixed now folks :arbiblobblue:
undefined says 🥰🥰🥰
undefined says Hey my txn says 2745 days remaining… i kno others have this issue to for transferring funds back to mainnet, any help?
undefined says Hey this issue is now solved, can you refresh and see if it sill remains the same?
undefined says where can i read about how to stake ARB$?
undefined says Hey all, 

At DAOhaus we use a Gnosis API for getting gas estimates for our executing multicall transactions once a proposal has passed. While this seems to work well on other chains, we're noticing some trouble when trying to execute on Arbitrum. 

Is there a clean way to estimate gas of multicall actions on Arbitrum (perhaps a propietary API)? 

Or if not, what are other devs doing to handle multicall gas estimations here?
undefined says Is anyone else currently having issues with the Arbiscan API? It stopped working for me about 2 hours or so ago
undefined says yep same glad its not jsut me, my key stopped working
undefined says thx for confirming
undefined says I'm getting this problem again
undefined says 
undefined says Yeah I changed RPCs and my forge scripts are constantly erroring out
undefined says still the same
undefined says Still experiencing this problem.

The RPC is not the problem, it is something about your network. Forge scripts do not have this problem with any other network.
undefined says Looks like support didn't help because I didn't make a  basic script that interacts in any way with two smart contracts? guys cmon.
undefined says Yeah my api key still says it’s invalid
undefined says I am facing similar issues
undefined says There is an issue with Aritrum RPC endpoints. This is not isolated to a specific node provider. I've been getting `HttpProviderError` trying to connect to various RPC endpoints. Other users reporting similar issues, seems there's a problem
undefined says Oh good, glad to see others' API Keys are saying invalid as well.
undefined says So all of a sudden API keys on Alchemy, Infura, Ankr expired all at the same time... That makes a lot of sense.
undefined says Oh snap, must be tied to block height or something.
undefined says The Arbiscan API seems to be back
undefined says G
undefined says The gas usage will be different at different time, this is because l2 will charge the gas used to post calldata on l1, but l1 gas price is changing, so the total amount gas on l2 will change too: https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/gas-faqs#q-gas-changes
undefined says Does it fail due to gas reasons?
undefined says Could you provide more detail about this errors?
undefined says I untar db.tar again and use the comman like `docker run --rm -it  -v /Volumes/WorkSpace/arbitrum/mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url=geth.url --node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream --node.rpc.nitroexport.enable --node.cache.allow-slow-lookup --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000 --node.rpc.enable-l1-calls --node.rpc.tracing.enable
`,but it's still wrong with error
undefined says What is the error reason this time?
undefined says getValueImpl error: failed loaded core machine register with hash 49179297511802694777863000768740565314490999448160535564554585931321880138081: NotFound:
undefined says 
undefined says May I ask why you add `--node.rpc.nitroexport.enable=true` ?
undefined says I need to Exporting Data from a Classic Arbitrum Node
undefined says Ok. Did you untar the snapshot on top of your existing db? This is the reason may cause it. Merging together the files of two dbs results in a corrupted db.
undefined says but I untar it init a empty dir
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs By the way, is there a file index.json on the network I can download? Thanks
undefined says We don’t provide this, but `--init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"`
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I need to start nitro at An earlier block before 22207817
undefined says Oh, that would be impossible because before 22207817 the inbox format is different from post-nitro, so your nitro node can’t handle those tx from classic inbox.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Can I friend you for a specific technical question？
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  sorry for bothering you again, is there any feedback from your team? I'm wondering why I got rate limited since I was not using any 3rd-party public RPC.
undefined says Accepted
undefined says Sorry, still no response, I just pined again.
undefined says :oldarbitrum:
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs  any words on the high gas prices on Arbitrum Goerli? It seems it's again very high (34 gwei atm)
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs how can i get l1 used gas for this transaction on solidity ?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L102
undefined says Has anyone come up with a solution to `couldn't create jwt secret               err="open /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/jwtsecret: no such file or directory" fileName=/home/user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/jwtsecret` while creating a fresh instance using `v2.0.12-65d4e7a`?
undefined says Where can I find the state roots that arbitrum posts to L1?
undefined says Hey
undefined says Is there any option for a golang sdk for Arbitrum? I was using the standard geth implementation but I'm having some issues when using against Arbitrum.
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/
undefined says they're posted to the Outbox on L1: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0B9857ae2D4A3DBe74ffE1d7DF045bb7F96E4840
undefined says I accidentally sent all my Ether to this address on Ether eum. It is the same address as the ARB c ontrac t address on Abritrum. Is it possible to retrieve my funds? This is all i have. Or was.
undefined says 0x91 2CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e4 9E6548
undefined says Came here looking for this error message...
undefined says Hey guys, my Twitter acc was hacked by the bots from this server, can someone knows what i can do to get it back?
undefined says If someone replied to my earlier messages i was unable to see them before i got booted for some reason.
undefined says Arbitrum deployer may _possibly_ be able to deploy a contract to this address on eth to recover the funds. It's the ARB token address, just the wrong chain.
undefined says if you're having issues with a Twitter acct, you'll have to go through Twitter support
undefined says Chris, are you able to reply to my earlier messages please? Quite distraught, really sorry to be a bother.
undefined says you from /r/ethfinance?
undefined says During the ARB token claim it seemed like the network was under a ton of stress that it couldn’t handle. Will this be an issue in the future or is it fixable?
undefined says Yes, thank you for your reply there i just saw it. How to proceed? Thank you thank you thank you for your time and effort. I'm sorry if I've stressed you and the team in any way.
undefined says the network itself was fine but RPC nodes did go down from the 10x peak traffic and a lot of users experienced degraded usage; I think all RPC operators are improving their infrastructure for future growth including us (but also our 3rd party providers)
undefined says I dmed you
undefined says I ended up running the docker command with `v2.0.11-8e786ec` waiting a few seconds for it to create the necessary files, then stopping and running it with `v2.0.12-65d4e7a` and that appears to have worked.
undefined says I just checked, not really seeing a state root, where can I find the outbox contract on GitHub?
undefined says Thank you. Was the sequencer down aswell, would a transaction been succesful if it was done using a private self hosted node?
undefined says no, we were posting blocks the entire time and that's on chain and verifiable on L1
undefined says more deets here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging#protocol-flow and you can view source on Etherscan or under the contracts folder in our nitro repo:  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro
undefined says er meant to tag @Web3 Philosopher on that last reply
undefined says the inbox contract is what you'd check to confirm blocks were being processed on L2 (during the token drop)
undefined says Cool thx
undefined says Does anyone know if ledger live works with arbitrum
undefined says does anyone else think that the arbitrum goerli testnet gas is high ?
undefined says seems to clock in at 6gwei, when mainnet seems to be at 0.1gwei am I missing something here what's the 17.6 data mean in the gas tracker 🤔
undefined says is there a gas tracker for arbitrum goerli
undefined says Howdy everyone, I have one question, I hope I am posting in the correct channel, I found this address 0x4FDA2C9d09403a76BDa445fFdfAf6dE5971732b0 with more than 1,000 ETH transaction out without received any ETH, I have checked with different explorers, I thought it was a explorer bug, but I always get the txs, what am I missing?
undefined says You can see this at arbiscan directly: https://goerli.arbiscan.io , yup, currently many users test on goerli and send a lot of tx to make the gas higher.
undefined says Hey, those are deposit tx: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3ec92c9d09403a76bda445ffdfaf6de59717219f#deposittxs , and that address you see is aliased address: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
undefined says I didn't know that Arbitrum has address aliasing, thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, will be nice if the explorer could handle it and show those deposits in the aliased address.
undefined says 
undefined says Hey, I updated the version of nitro node in the docs.

It seems not updated due to verification. I already signed twice via docusign.

Could you check it please?

I can't post the link. It's in arbitrum-docs repo, issue #191.
undefined says Oh,, I requested yesterday. And it has been updated! Forget it.

I'll just close the issue.
undefined says Appreciate this ser, I can see that L2 blockhashes are posted to L1, my only issue now, is that it's stored in a mapping which uses "roots" as it's keys.

Is there a mapping for L2 blocknumber to L2 blockhash?
undefined says you can use eth_getBlockByHash on a arbitrum node
undefined says The explore shows this is a system tx.
undefined says Yeah I could but It doesn't make sense to scan the entire mapping looking for a specific block.

Is there no where in the nitro code that stores blocknumber => blockhash/stateroot?
undefined says there is also eth_getBlockByNumber
undefined says So thing is, I'm trying to obtain state proofs of arbitrum's blocks on Ethereum. 

But my state proofs need to have the blocknumber included as well.
undefined says ya I am not quite sure which part you are blocked on
undefined says Lemme rephrase the question, say I wanted to challenge arbitrum's blocks on L1 and I only had the blocknumber, which transaction do I make?
undefined says this is not how our fraud proof works, you cannot challenge a block, you have to challenge the end state of the assertion
undefined says I see, so there's absolutely no metadata about l2blocknumber => l2blockhash on L1?
undefined says basically yes, apart from numBlock (total number of block contained in a assertion) is part of the assertion input, but only stored as a hash along with some other thing
undefined says which chain should I hold ARB to be eligible for voting? ETH or ARB chain?
undefined says you can only delegate on Arb One
undefined says I have started arbitrum testnet full node with --node.rpc.tx-fee-cap 2 , how can I check that it is applied to binary or not? please guide me with it, thanks
undefined says Hey! That flag sets the cap on transaction fee (in ether) that can be sent via the RPC APIs. What are you trying to accomplish?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs  I want to check that the transaction fee cap has been applied or not?
undefined says Actually our transaction has been initiated by a Rust client and hence it would be difficult
What we are trying is setting the tx fee cap higher for the node itself
We used a flag mentioned in the documentation. But how can I confirm that it has been set successfully.?
undefined says You can try to send a tx with a price high enough that it would go over that cap, for example (you should get an error if the cap is working)
undefined says sure will do that
undefined says 👍
undefined says 
undefined says May I ask how to check the status of cross-chain messages? For example, I send a createRetryableTicket transaction in L1, and I want to monitor the status of L2
L1Transaction Goerli txHash:0xa04c0124a97a1aa352ca910efbacb327b293bb8aa26b9319b401ac311170458e
I need to listen for the status between L1 and L2
undefined says You can use the SDK for that. Here's an example of how it is done when sending a token from L1 to L2. Notice that after getting the receipt, you have the method `waitForL2` available => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/token-deposit/scripts/exec.js#L91-L102

Also, if you're looking to send ETH to a different address on L2, there's a specific method for that in the SDK => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/assetBridger/ethBridger.ts#L231
undefined says I made an arbitrum deposit tx, the tx hash on the ethereum side is:0x5d2244d3764c326a032a3a809c424f48914bad07bb87fd61282b33a34aebf812

It has been over an hour but the funds have still not been received on the arbitrum side, any idea why?
undefined says Open a support ticket
undefined says Hey, I can see your tx failed to auto-redeem on l2  (might be due to not enough gas provided), you can manually redeem it here (also this can be used to find the status of any l1-l2 tx):
https://retryable-tx-panel-nitro.arbitrum.io/tx/0x5d2244d3764c326a032a3a809c424f48914bad07bb87fd61282b33a34aebf812
undefined says In Nova, where the Data Availability committee runs with Reddit etc, do those participants get compensated? Is there any documentation on how the DAC works?
undefined says I send many USDT transfer transactions
But sometimes I encounter the problem
"max fee per gas less than block base fee, maxFeePerGas: 100000000 baseFee: 11783220000"}"
undefined says 
undefined says i will send you a message @Mahsa | Offchain Labs the bot is capping me, i cant post
undefined says what are you trying to post? summarize it diff
undefined says Is there any JS code sample to process token swap allowances in Arbitrum ?
undefined says my web3js code which I used for BSC , does not work: TypeError: contractAddress.methods.allowance is not a function
undefined says Did you try refresh it ?
undefined says Hey, this mainly because our base price is increasing fast and when your tx gets relayed to sequencer, the price  has already increased, I would suggest you to set a little higher gasPrice when send your tx. (It will cost the same if you set higher)
undefined says 
undefined says What would be the best way to test the L2 -> L1 flow (`sendTxToL1`) described in the docs (l2-to-l1-messages-lifecycle) via something like a Foundry test, if possible? Or if not possible to do in Foundry, is there a some testnet version of arbitrum that doesn't have the 7d wait period?
undefined says Hey, i'm trying to fork Arbitrum on a specific block using hardhat. but the block.number inside my forked chain is equivalent to L2 block number, instead of supposed L1 block number . is there any way to work around this ?
undefined says Anyone have a clue? Still wondering about this
undefined says Hey, you could use our testnet (arbgoerli)  where the wait period for the L2-L1 msgs is way less than 7 days (~20 blocks).
Info about this chain can be found here:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains
undefined says Sweet thanks! That's 20 mainnet blocks I assume? 4 minutes isn't to bad for a one-off though a bit much for a Foundry unit test 😅 

Has anyone tested this path in Foundry? Maybe something like forking to anvil, or just through mocking?
undefined says Yup. I'm not aware of that. 
But you might want to  take a look at https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/abf3d6b86fcffb5114180318c40824137442786d/test/testhelper.ts#L91
which is how we mock l2-l1 message in our token-bridge-contract repo, within a single hardhat fork
undefined says The is quite expected as  there isn't real hardhat forking support for Arb yet. It just treats it like a generic EVM chain.
undefined says 
undefined says When will this change go live?
undefined says Can I get some help plz? I believe I bridged 0.39 eth into ARB on Oct 03, 2021 - but I can not figure out on ARBISCAN what happened to that eth. I have very little eth on Arb network and no txn history going back to eth main net... @Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says Do you still have the Txn mate?
undefined says Which wallet do you use
undefined says Can you sent the tx hash
undefined says What bridge did you use
undefined says 0x5a675eef1355263b2672d4a1a3573a9919956ff5fcbcee57036a67789e72a764
undefined says I dont recall what bridge I used...
undefined says It is weird why it finally consume the same, but I should set higher.
undefined says I see your token sent back to l1 154 days ago: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x8e539fa55067452089e5c3d9a286aea381eca37641250c0061953940a4f18693
undefined says Can you confirm that mate and tell me
undefined says I'm not receive airdrop
undefined says 
undefined says Thanks 🙏
undefined says Which wallet is affected mate?
undefined says 
undefined says I just discovered that the issue was fixed on the 'foundry' about 18 hours ago! 👀
undefined says 
undefined says I'm trying to calculate the exact gas amount consumed for a transaction using the transaction receipt. I'm assuming some combination of gasUsed, gasUsedForL1, cumulativeGasUsed, and effectiveGasPrice should produce the right result, but can't seem to quite get there. Using the following random transaction as an example:

0xf1b4855aa312996e03e9df92834b9a24cf88c974abca95f8c68b16c47e0967b4

Question #1: What is the actual gas consumed by the user? Arbiscan shows 0.00013701261096, but that is already different from what I get by querying an archive node to get the wallet's balance difference before and after the txn, which is 0.000137012610968697. Is the Arbiscan UI is just truncating the last four digits?

Question #2: Assuming the right number is 0.000137012610968697, how do we get that number based on the fields in the txn receipt? gasUsed: 0.000000000000483171, cumulativeGasUsed: 0.000000000000040651, effectiveGasPrice: 0.000000000283569607, gasUsedForL1: 0.000000000000442520. Based on the docs, I thought it would be ((gasUsed x effectiveGasPrice) + gasUsedForL1), but that doesn't equal the expected number. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
undefined says From the transactionReceipt, you would calculate the tx fees with gasUsed * effectiveGasPrice, but it's going to give you the same result that appears in Arbiscan.
undefined says It does not. gasUsed * effectiveGasPrice =  0.000137012610583797 which is close, but not correct.  I presume there needs to be additional compensation due to L1 gas fees, but the txn receipt does not seem to contain the right number. I'm assuming this is related to the recent changes of removing `feeStats` from the receipt.
undefined says Oh, you're right. Let me take a closer look into this, as this is a classic block. I see that Arbiscan data matches the txReceipt for newer blocks (Nitro).
Actually it all boils down to how Arbiscan calculate the "Transaction Fee" field for classic blocks, as it does not match "gas usage * gas price paid"
undefined says Hey guys, may I ask

**What is the Uniswap Router address for Arbitrum One?**
undefined says WHY UNISWAP ROUTER CONTRACT IS NOT VERIFIED ON ARB GOERLI?
undefined says 
undefined says on restarting my classic container it started syncing from scratch even though all the data exists in `/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet/db`
undefined says what could it be? how can i fix this?
undefined says has messed up the last checkpoint saved smh
undefined says Has there been documentation released on the requirements to run a sequencer? If so, where could I read up on that?
undefined says how recent is this?
undefined says Hy
undefined says Hy, I have any doubts about Arbitrum.
Sequencers, block validators and verifiers are 3 different players?
undefined says probably scammers.... i wanted to report predy protocoll... i deposited about 300 usdc one year ago... now the "admin" of their discord send me a link where i need to use my private key or seed phrase to get my funds back... predy is still on arbi HP but there are several red flags... like the admins account on discord is created march 2023 and so on
undefined says Is your usdc gone now?
undefined says how long does it take to sync a rpc node? I am at block `22,263,889`
undefined says 
undefined says even with the snapshot at snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar the arbitrum-classic node starts syncing right from start:
```
Previous checkpoint,  total gas used: 0, L1 block: 0, L2 block: 0, log count: 0, messages count: 0, timestamp: Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970
```
undefined says i dont know... nobody tells me there what to do
undefined says https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-5-decrease-censorship-delay-from-24-hours-to-4-hours/13047

I am officially proposing to decrease the force inclusion delay from 24 hours to 4 hours.

Please leave comments on the governance forum
undefined says nvm u mean the sequencer window not the withdrawal delay
undefined says by all means, if there is more precise language, I can update the proposal. I will admit, all of the repetition of "censorship" is partly for rhetorical effect. This is a governance can of worms after all. Few if any of the large token voters even know the protocol variable naming.

I know some of the security council are here. I greatly welcome a sanity check on the governance forum.
undefined says interesting proposal, hope this gets more attention once the initial AIPs get settled
undefined says if i need to receive arbitrum  blocks on my private arb node  as fast as possible, is it better better to have my own eth node for L1 on same server ?
undefined says I am testing arbitrum in local. The problem is that when I command 'test-node.bash --init', the sequencer gets an error like * 'node' has invalid keys: validator. How can we solve this?
undefined says Your l1 node can make you sync faster, but when you catch the latest state, you will subscribe to sequencer feed
undefined says Did you edit that bash file?
undefined says I've never edited it. I just set a new image to be built as a bash file on the sequencer of docker-compose.yaml.
undefined says Oh, how about not to set it, just use the default one and try again.
undefined says When I tried to run the example in nitro, I was prompted that I had no `precompilesgen`. I could get it by running the main method of file `gen.go` in directory `solgen`, right?
undefined says hey everyone I have proof I bridged over $50k but it did not count for the ARB airdrop. How does the protocol work for the airdop?
undefined says Pics aboe show example 20 ETH bridged but did not qualify as over $50k assets bridged
undefined says We have explained this here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/#precompiles
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution
undefined says This tx has stuck in the bridge: 
https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe4fb95f91721e645dd97eeb5621faa826a874d40ce8c3ba33050e6e9bc938cc9
undefined says @roo Sorry for tag, I cannot message in support. Can you please check why this bridge tx has not gone through?
undefined says You can visit https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/tx/0xe4fb95f91721e645dd97eeb5621faa826a874d40ce8c3ba33050e6e9bc938cc9 to redeem it, your first try failed due to some reasons. (Most case is gas not enough)
undefined says Does this represent the total number of L2 blocks contained in this Batch？
undefined says GM! I have a Solidity project deployed on ETH mainnet and I am thinking of deploying it also on Arbitrum. Is there a technical team that could help understand whether Arbitrum is similar to Ethereum enough for such deployment?
undefined says has arbitrum nova a public testnet?
undefined says gm! web3 (Frontend) & blockchain dev here, and freshly new Arbinaut as well. Glad to be among you 🫡
undefined says What's the current focus of the community on the arbitrum chain? (i.e. which kinds of protocols, what challenges are currently faced ..)
I'd love to contribute!
undefined says Hey team,

Does debug rpc call requires a full or archive node? Just to enable it.
undefined says Or will I be able to use the debug calls in full node.
undefined says Anyone pls?
undefined says Any update on this txn fee calculation issue?
undefined says My arbitrum balance is now showing 0 arbitrum, two days ago I swapped 100 ARB to Eth. How do I fix this?
undefined says Did you added the correct token to your wallet.
undefined says did you add the correct ARB token address to your wallet
undefined says Hey it's almost similar. There are some small differences you can find here:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences
https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support
https://developer.arbitrum.io/time
undefined says No,
You can use Goerli testnet. Because Nova uses Nitro stack and almost all the things (except the DA part) is similar. So for testings it's almost the same
undefined says Was the swapping successful ? @mallemol
undefined says Yes ofcourse
undefined says Hey depends on wht you wanna do. You can use debug_traceTransaction on full node. But if you want to have debug_traceCall, you need archival.
It's very similar to Ethereum,
undefined says Yes however it was just a part of my Total arbitrum
undefined says Can you ask the question on #📬︱support ?
undefined says He didn’t knew the answer and had sended me to this chat.
undefined says Oh sorry! could you send me your address? you can send it either here or you can DM me if you want it to be private
undefined says 0x8f28E547CB5a5BE5dd821F139fBE202F62D432d7
undefined says do you know if a timestamp based application would work accurate?
undefined says Yeah for longer terms, similar to Ethereum. You can read it here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/time#ethereum-block-numbers-within-arbitrum
undefined says Also note that each time our sequencer receives a tx, the timestamp will be updated by sequencer in the block.
undefined says Hey guys! I'm Biaf from Idle

I would like to talk with someone from the team to explore our contracts deployment on Arbitrium. 

Who's the best contact to discuss this? Thanks
undefined says No,
It’s number of txs included in this batch
Some L2 blocks may contain more than one tx
undefined says Drop an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Looking into it
undefined says You don’t have ARB on your wallet currently. You can see all transfers happened in you wallet here:

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8f28E547CB5a5BE5dd821F139fBE202F62D432d7#tokentxns
undefined says Sorry this is incorrect. You’re right!
It’s number of L1 incoming messages which indicates number of L2 blocks for post-nitro era
undefined says What issue do you have?
undefined says 
undefined says After restoring it to a batch of tx by decoding the `calldata` data in `L1 Submission Tx`. My understanding is: this should not be the number of tx contained in this batch, but the number of Message contained in this batch (Message is a one-to-one relationship with L2 Block, that is, a Message contains txs contained in the corresponding L2 Block). For example, if the `MessageCount` is 14974634, it means that the Message with serial number 14974634 contains txs in L2 Block with block number 14974634.
undefined says Then `prevMessageCount` refers to the starting sequence number of the Messages contained in this batch, and `newMessageCount` refers to the starting sequence number of the Messages contained in the next batch.

Of course, txs does not contain `system transactions`.
undefined says Oh yeah exactly. Sorry I corrected it above, you missed this one I think https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1092588052603478198
undefined says Aha, I didn't see this message before and ignored it.
undefined says Can you tell me the contract addresses officially operated by Arbitrum in Aribitrum One chain?
For example, a bridge that converts Ethereum from L1 to L2.
undefined says I'm looking at smart contracts to extract ERC20 transfer histories.
undefined says Here is the addresses: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses
undefined says Hey thank you for the input. 
So debug_tracecallmany would also require a archive node then right?
undefined says hello! When will the orbit be released?
undefined says We are still getting HTTP 403 when accessing the Nova feed sequencer.

```
INFO [03-27|02:24:45.931] connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed
WARN [03-27|02:24:45.956] failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://nova.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 403"
```

What are some possible workarounds aside from changing IP address? 🙏
undefined says How about running an arbitrum relayer on other host and your node connect to that one?
undefined says Yup, you need run archive node
undefined says our team is developing DEX, which requires a lot of tx at Arbitrum. The tx fee is still insufficient to test on Arbitrum testnet. So I want to test an arbitrum node where tx fees are free on local. Is there a way?
undefined says Hey!
It looks like there were some rounding issues in Classic RPCs, so for classic txns "gas used * price paid" will not exactly equal "txn fees".
undefined says Have you checked Arbitrum's docs on how to run a local node for development?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node
undefined says In the past is there arbitrum network suspend history timeline?
undefined says Hey, there have been sequencer downtimes in the past (it's less likely now) but no reorg happened. As long as the sequencer posted all the accepted transactions already, there's no risk of reorg.
undefined says Hello! How can I get Eth on testnet?
undefined says Hey! You can either acquire funds directly on an Arbitrum chain, or get funds on a chain's underlying L1 and bridge it across.  Please see this for how you can get testnet Ether:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/getting-started-users#get-some-native-currency
undefined says How is it possible to acquire testnet faucet tokens directly from arbitrum?
undefined says We have a twitter faucet. It's the second option in that link I sent (nitro goerli rollup)
undefined says There it is possible to get only a few. We are testing our smart contracts, we need more. Is it possible to distribute more?
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says No ser, we don't do that unfortunately.
undefined says No way to get extra testnet faucet coins?
undefined says How we can we arrange testnet without coins?
undefined says Well, you can get Goerli Eth and bridge it to ArbGoerli.
undefined says Any idea if/when there will be an API endpoint for getting holder list for ERC-20 token?
undefined says Hey team, I'm trying to determine how to programmatically interact with the bridge in some simple ways. For example:

1. If I want to send WETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum, I think this is the appropriate method: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/libraries/gateway/ITokenGateway.sol#L43 . But then what is the calldata argument supposed to be?
2. If I want to send raw ETH from Ethereum to Arbitrum, I see some possible methods in the deprecated repo, but nothing in the new one. My best guess maybe is this one? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/abf3d6b86fcffb5114180318c40824137442786d/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/IL1GatewayRouter.sol#L48... but again, still no idea what some of these arguments are.

Thanks 🙏
undefined says you just need to call `deposit` on the bridge contract. Here's a TS example, trying to find a SOL example for you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/token-deposit/scripts/exec.js#L82
undefined says Thanks, yah I was looking a bit at the TS stuff there. Ideally, I need an example of the direct contract binding (we're a Rust shop). I could probably trace through the TS, but was trying to read the solidity.
undefined says also for simple ETH deposit, you can use `depositETH` on the Inbox: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#eth-deposits; it's also worth reading up on retryable tickets if you're sending from a contract to deposit funds on L2. This allows you to add gas on L2 if need be to complete transaction (also allows you to send any arbitrary RPC command to L2 from L1)
undefined says see Greeter tutorial for example of retryable ticket: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/greeter/contracts/ethereum/GreeterL1.sol
(use bridge for ERC20s)
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#bridging-erc20-tokens
undefined says 
undefined says Right, I looked at all this too. The problem is it doesn't actually describe the arguments to the function & also doesn't point to a specific repo/correct version of the contracts. 

I think this is the right repo? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts

If so, I see the `outboundTransfer` method cited in the docs in `ITokenGateway`

But actually the docs say to prefer `IL1GatewayRouter`... but this isn't implemented in some cases? Not clear how to programmatically tell which method I'm supposed to use here.

And then in either case, I haven't found any documentation at all describing what/how to do with the call data argument in either method/contract.
undefined says For WETH you can also call on the L1GatewayRouter directly, example tx: 0x5cb2c1e12beb0ae0fddbae94968183dac581e15a55d0ac066040a2716712c68b
undefined says https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5cb2c1e12beb0ae0fddbae94968183dac581e15a55d0ac066040a2716712c68b
undefined says input from above: 
```

undefined says 
undefined says Jesus I keep getting blocked by the mod bots for trying to post links & examples here.

Will try again -- where does the calldata argument come from in the tx example you just sent?
undefined says sorry about the link ban, yeah super annoying. I think we should at least WL etherscan / arbiscan, etc and we may relax that ban at some point, but I think during the token drop the scams got too crazy to moderate for a bit there
undefined says it's under `Input Data` on etherscan (you may have to expand tx to see all details)
undefined says Sure, I get it. Annoying, but better than the alternative. Maybe WL Github too if you get around to making those changes.

Right, yes I see the actual value being sent. My question is where does that get serialized / how do I know how to set it myself? Because all the methods you've sent to call require it.
undefined says ```Storage: Minimum 2TB SSD (make sure it is extendable)```

Is it time to update the storage data reference provided on the website for an archive node running both Arbitrum One Classic and Arbitrum One?
undefined says Like this method:

```
function outboundTransferCustomRefund(
        address _token,
        address _refundTo,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _maxGas,
        uint256 _gasPriceBid,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external payable returns (bytes memory);
```

requires me to know what to pass for `_data`.
undefined says had the same experience so  I can confirm its a bug
undefined says What is the address for Uni-v3 NonFungiblePositionManager?   In their doc, it says 0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88, but on arbiscan for goerli, this is just a EOA.  When I manually mint a LP through their UI, it's interacting with 0x622e4726a167799826d1E1D150b076A7725f5D81.    Does anyone know if there's a proxy address for this?
undefined says Yes, we have a new version that fixes that bug => v2.0.13-174496c
cc: @lockesmith
undefined says Yeap, that's the one => https://github.com/Uniswap/interface/pull/5457
undefined says how to bridge arb from arbitrum one to arbitrum nova as there is no liquidity of arb at nova through multichain.org?
undefined says you can `abi.encode(maxSubmissionCost, new bytes(0))` to generate `_data` where `maxSubmissionCost` is max cost in wei for submitting the transaction, it is a `uint256`
undefined says @kayolord you can see a TS example of generating the inner data here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/assetBridger/erc20Bridger.ts#L532 (above solidity should perform the same)
undefined says I'm trying to run Arbitrum nitro node but I keep getting these errors in docker log:

My L1 ETH node definitely synced up and running good. I'm using newest docker image. Could somebody advise what could be wrong?
undefined says is it archive the l1 node?
undefined says That error "failed to get logs for block #16550471 (0xfae132..a332e3)" is coming directly from your L1 node. Idk what L1 node you're using, but either it doesn't have that historical state, it's still syncing it, or there's some sort of a bug.
undefined says 
undefined says but why? god
undefined says `error reading inbox                      err="abi: attempting to unmarshall an empty string while arguments are expected"`
undefined says that's an issue with your L1 node. Is it synced?
undefined says I am using ankr
undefined says Good evening.
How long does it take to go from NOVA to Arbitrum Eth?
it's been seven days.
Graff branding is not active.

I read this tutorial 

and did everything as written.

the network is correct, I have ETH for gas.


Tried with another browser and cleared cookies.
the result has not changed.

undefined says and I understood.
what about my question? my problem?
undefined says Ask in #📬︱support but I'd try refreshing or waiting a bit longer
undefined says already asked.
they sent here.
well looking forward to tomorrow.
just a have 1 withdrawal ready to claime, but  is not active/
undefined says Do you switch your network to l1 mainnet?
undefined says yes.
L1 - this is arbitrum ONE.
but why does the bridge tell me to switch.
although I am in L1.
i tried another browser and another computer - same thing
undefined says No, l1 means ethereum mainnet
undefined says You should switch to ethereum mainnet and claim it.
undefined says O,
Apparently I did not fully understand everything, or did not get enough sleep yesterday.
Thank you.
although I tried yesterday on the ETH mainnet.
thanks:arbiblobblue: 
and sorry
undefined says I just read the arbitrum bridge token doc and I have a question:
If we want to issue our token on arbitrum natively(which means mintable on arbitrum), then we must use a special gateway?
undefined says no, if it's a native token, there's no necessity to do anything other than deploy an ERC20...one caveat though: if you want people to be able to exit to L1 via "a reverse gateway" through our official bridge, then you can deploy an L2 gateway for that purpose and register it with our bridge. That's totally optional and it can technically be done at any time, but you'll want to retain the ability to prove your ownership of the ERC20 on L2 (ie set the owner to a multisig you control)
undefined says Thanks!
Yes, we want the token can be bridge to L1. When you say `then you can deploy an L2 gateway for that purpose and register it with our bridge.` do you mean something like the L2 Dai Gateway or L2 Livepeer Gateway list in the doc?
undefined says We have reverse custom gateway code may help you: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/commit/abf3d6b86fcffb5114180318c40824137442786d#diff-5a1862a8505a7e9f1bd91084cc5230f7f05a0b5bf4f167a8959e70e488dbbed0
undefined says And it was implemented for our arb token: https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbcE8aA77782F13D4202a230d978F361B011dB27 and https://arbiscan.io/address/0xCaD7828a19b363A2B44717AFB1786B5196974D8E
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says I follow the PR to make my reverse L1, L2 token. Is there official reverse gateway on goerli and arbitrum-goerli so that I can make some test?
undefined says hey, can someone from the team clarify the following:
In the case of L2 -> L1 messages, when is the merkle tree of messages posted on L1? Is it posted / available in L1 several minutes after the L2 initiation transaction (not being finalized) OR the merkle tree of the messages gets posted **only after** it gets complete finalization (1 week)?
Thank you
undefined says Yup, you can find all information here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses#token-bridging
undefined says The send root will post to l1 when validator make the assetion, and after 7 days, if no one challenge this assertion or this validator win all the challenges, the send root will moved to bridge contract so anyone can execute it.
undefined says And currently validator will make assertions every hours.
undefined says Thank you @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs . So in theory after several minutes - at most an hour the data availability of the L2 -> L1 message will be encoded and posted on L1 by the sequencer and dApps that are willing to use it "optimistically" and not wait for finality can derive a merkle inclusion proof that the message is there. However if a dApp wants to use the in-built by Arbitrum way of transferring data, he must wait finality (7 days)?
undefined says this is as easy to debug as adding fmt.Printf() statements to core/state_transition.go:Process() inside the `for` loop and compare the original block with your own processing function.
undefined says I am getting this error on an Arbitrum node I'm trying to sync: error creating blocks                    err="missing trie node f4df8bae6ce69bf9a909fc43d97ad331aa61007feabb322eb26261a65451aaab (owner eb93f41485f2d423fa139a74a5c3ea6a2c1ee1d6b6e025e8dd3e74a9d5719021) (path 01020e03) <nil>"
undefined says How do I fix it?
undefined says try restarting the node and checking your internet connection to ensure that all necessary data is being transmitted correctly.
undefined says Hello! I have problem that why im sending transaction via my own node or via sequencer link dierectly it takes like 200-300 ms to get hash. I have 4-5 ms ping to sequencer from my server, so it must take way lower time. Is any way to reduce it?
undefined says Hi! #📬︱support sent me here and told me to tag one of you.

I'm spinning up a Classic node from the snapshots provided by the Arb team. After the node starts up, I see logs about the node initializing. However, the RPC endpoint is still unreachable after ~7 hours. I've confirmed networking is setup properly and even hopped into the container to confirm that nothing was being served on the http RPC port.

I saw previous messages from  @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  that this could take a few hours. How long does a Classic node typically take to initialize from snapshots before the RPC endpoint is served? And is there a way to tell if it's making progress? Thanks for the help team!
undefined says It’s up to your disk latency, but sense you have waited 7 hours, it should start very soon.
undefined says No, sequencer post the calldata every minutes currently. What I said is rblock, this is used for fraud proof and proposed by validators, the send root also included in rblock. The batch sequencer posts only include tx and don’t include any state. And for l2 to l1 messages, yup it needs 7 days to confirm.
undefined says I made my L1, and L2 token and use them to pass the reverseCustomGateway.e2e.ts(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/test/reverseCustomGateway.e2e.ts) test.
Now I want to test in goerli and arb-goerli, but I don't know how to get the params for registerTokenOnL2. So I use AdminErc20Bridger.registerCustomToken from arb-sdk to help me get the params but it shows errors as the image.
I am not sure the AdminErc20Bridger.registerCustomToken is the right way to get the registerTokenOnL2 params or not, can you give me some hint?
undefined says Yes, the problem has been solved. It is geth's own problem.
undefined says Thanks for getting back to me @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs! It's been another 12 hours since I sent that message (19 hr total), and it's still not up. Any ideas on where to debug next?

undefined says Anyone know if Arbiscan's API works? I keep getting 403's 'Forbidden' calling it with simple balance queries. I'm using the same code with other chain explorers and it works fine there. Also double-checked my API key is correct.
undefined says message the admin
undefined says The admin of arbiscan? Not sure how to do that. They don't have a discord afaik. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for help on this
undefined says you probably need a different API key for Arbiscan: https://docs.arbiscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics can't just use Etherscan key for it
undefined says please help me .... how to claim in L1 .. already 12 days passes ... waiting from you
undefined says I used arbiscan api keys. Tried two of them
undefined says i got this error when publish and verify my contract: ```Error! Unable to verify source code
Exception err_code_1 Occured: ERROR - Unable to connect to the remote server```
undefined says What are the voting conditions on snapshot?
undefined says https://link.medium.com/054brtHBQyb
undefined says is there any google/excel sheet publicly available containing all eligible addresses for the ARB airdrop?
undefined says You have to get your data from ARB snapshot
undefined says what's the url to get gas fee in arbitrum? something like this in eth https://ethgasstation.info/api/ethgasAPI.json
undefined says any support here to answer my question?
undefined says Wdym?
undefined says I am not sure there are any google/excel sheet for your purpose
but in general, for this work, you have to get eligible addresses from snapshot.
undefined says where can i find the snapshot
undefined says You have to install full node
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Could please help me look into my case? Thanks a lot.
1) Currently, I am running a L1 mainnet full node, the port 8545 is proper working as:
/home/ubuntu# curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8545 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "id":1}'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0x1039a78"}
2) I am also properly running a L2 Arb full node via the quick node RPC, with the settings:
docker run -d -v ~/data/arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url="<Quick node RPC>" --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro-recent.tar" --ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*
3) However, When I replace the quick node RPC in 2) by my L1 API l1.url="http://0.0.0.0:8545", the initialization is stopped at: 
INFO [04-09|20:56:09.357] received error response from L1 RPC      request="{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"eth_chainId\"}" response=nil err="Post \"http://0.0.0.0:8545\": dial tcp 0.0.0.0:8545: connect: connection refused"
Version: v2.0.11-8e786ec, time: 2023-02-07T11:11:46-06:00

Fatal configuration error: too many errors trying to connect to L1: Post "http://0.0.0.0:8545": dial tcp 0.0.0.0:8545: connect: connection refused
undefined says Replace `-p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548` with `--network host`. This will let the nitro node connect to other services on your computer by putting it in the same network namespace as everything else.
undefined says It works! that is fantastic. Thank you Lee
undefined says Please help! (If I made a mistake in the chat, I apologize and redirect). Sent 100 USDT to Binance on the Arbitrum One network. It turned out that input from the Arbitrum network is not yet possible. The funds are stuck. The Binance team has tentatively estimated a 100 BUSD refund fee (after investigation). Can the Arbitrum team help me? Thank you in advance! TxID 0x1cb8169e6af43b029a4f6fcacbef099a4a7a6376fa2d0a5af6aeab66313f3d69
undefined says My metamask had been hacked is there any way you guys can retrieve my Arbitrum?
undefined says Does anyone know how to do an ETH bridging from ethereum to arbitrum, where we send the resulting ETH on the arbitrum side to a different address then the sender on the ethereum side? I know we need to create a retryable ticket, but not sure what the params should be
undefined says I need help. I transferred from Arbitrum Cocoin exchange to my wallet, but since last night, it still hasn't been credited to my account.
undefined says Hey, to be able to send ETH to a different address using this `createRetryableTicket` method, would I need to deploy a contract or could I do this directly from `ethers.js` in javascript?
undefined says We have sdk for this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/assetBridger/ethBridger.ts#L230
undefined says Nice! I think this is what I need, was this recently added?
undefined says It was added on feb
undefined says What about now? Can you your node serve rpc request?
undefined says Could you see your system log and b check if it is OOM?
undefined says We have a tutorial show how to register custom gateway, you can see it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Thanks. I figure out that the ARB token is using forceOnlyReverseGateway instead of reverseGateway, that's why SDK can't estimate gas since the registerTokenOnL2 will revert. After I deploy my own reverseGateway it works. Very appreciate your help!
undefined says 👋 i need your help
undefined says when withdrawing usdt from baybit to my blockchain wallet, I chose the wrong network.
undefined says and now usdt stuck in the Arbitrum network
undefined says i found wallet witch on
undefined says help me please get my usdt to my wallet or send  back to baybit
undefined says Hey, do you still control your wallet?
If yes, your funds are not lost, they are sitting in your wallet on the Arbitrum network (according to what you've mentioned).
See this tutorial to learn how to use the Arbitrum bridge to transfer your funds to L1:
https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/
undefined says Is there an easy way to read L1 state from Arbitrum ? Specifically, I'd like to check that a specific user has a specific NFT minted on Eth, and do something with that info on Arbitrum.
In the docs I only see cross messaging but that forces user to submit a tx first on L1, and was wondering if there would any better ways (given I only want to read).
undefined says Arbitrum (L2) and Ethereum (L1) are two different networks. ‏You can't reach out from L2 to read from L1 state.  You need to use our cross chain messaing where the L1 calls up to L2 to pass the information (as you said)
There might be some oracle tools that can provide this info too.
undefined says I know these are two different networks 🙂 But i was wondering if Arbitrum already provided some functionalities for this use case (Arbitrum RPC could offer this functionality natively and have a precompile onchain or stg).

All right - thank you !
undefined says Hey if I need to run archive node, do I need l1 archive node? Or full node will work too?
Sorry new to L2 protocols.
undefined says In respect to this. 
As I am spinning erigon archive node since it is only available in erigon ethereum node. So erigon archive is mandatory I suppose?
undefined says You don’t need to run archive l1 node.
undefined says Hey, what are the current hardforks and EIPS implemented in Arbitrum? I coduln't find this information easily. Ideally I would need a release history / changelog of when they were implemented. Thanks.
undefined says Is it possible to run a node without docker?
undefined says I found the wollet witch my money on but i dint control it
undefined says Anyone knows of a reputable token mint factory for Arbitrum?
undefined says Quick question on bridging: if users have already sent our token through default standard bridging, but we plan to deploy on Arbitrum later and use the L1CustomGateway Contract to link contracts, how do we consolidate with/switch from the default contract (deployed automatically by default bridging)? Hope that makes sense.
undefined says the protocol isn't simply a fork of Ethereum. Arbitrum is a layer 2 on top of Ethereum. We do use a fork of Geth for the EVM, but that is just for executing Solidity, it doesn't play any role in consensus. We use layer 1 smart contracts to guarantee the state of layer 2
undefined says not supported at this time
undefined says Thank you
undefined says token mint factory? what's a mainnet example you're interested in?
undefined says is your L1 ERC20 contract upgradeable? or can you make arbitrary calls from the contract?
undefined says L1 is upgradeable.
undefined says Thanks. I get that. I'm currently working on reprocessing history of Arbitrum within EthereumJS. As an example I did that for Optimism which had minor EIPs differences and they almost corresponded 1-to-1. I guess Arbitrum does not really translate that easily. Do you have an overview somewhere detailing the differences with respect to standard geth? I'm mainly interested in opcodes and gas calculation differences.
undefined says I'm only interested in the execution side and not on consensus at this time.
undefined says when you say EIP differences, do you mean the JSON-RPC methods and their responses? 

in that case, see: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences
undefined says (those are different concepts by the way, although some EIPs do result in additional methods added)
undefined says Arbitrum nitro's EVM is at the point of the L1 merge. At some point there will be an upgrade to Arbitrum networks to Shanghai's EVM semantics adding PUSH0 and such.
undefined says also see: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/geth#miscellaneous-geth-changes
undefined says Hello! Anyone have any Goerli Arbitrum ETH for testing purposes? Need at least 0.5 AGOR. Currently building a protocol/dapp on Arbitrum but need to test everything and having a hard time finding AGOR - any chance someone here can help us out?
undefined says You should reach out to support instead @rоо (wіll ΝЕVЕR DМ уоu fіrѕt)
undefined says encountering constant failures when trying to deploy contracts onto arbitrum goerli with a forge script
undefined says Hey, I would like to run an archival node of Goerli. Is it same to run both classic and nitro as One?

Which block hieght does change from classic to nitro?
undefined says `See this if you want to run an archive node for Nitro Goerli Rollup Testnet or Arbitrum Nova.`

'**this**' links to https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node.mdx -> here...
undefined says If you want to run goerli arbitrum archive node, you should just run nitro. Goerli doesn’t contain classic state.
undefined says Same flag when I run the archival node of One nitro, right?
undefined says Yup, just need to change the l1 url to goerli and l2 chainid to 421613
undefined says What errors did you get?
undefined says How big is the storage needed?
undefined says 2 TB for Arb1, I am not sure about goerli and I believe it should much less than this.
undefined says Arb's official bridge has a problem that can't be claimed
undefined says Is it ok?
undefined says Try clean the cache and re-claim or check your network is on l1 or not.
undefined says it's been 2 weeks nothing happened, I've canceled 1 week ago but nothing happen
undefined says attach
undefined says Is time boost already in effect? 
If not, any approximate eta?
undefined says Is this your tx? https://etherscan.io/tx/0x03094263b98ffac4bac816be720140ee0223f26f3b23cca724b30a732f41fcf6
I see it was created 30 minutes ago (and it might take a bit of time to execute because gas is a bit low)
undefined says yes sir that is , sorry i see i've sending eth to my friend i've canceled it
undefined says It's not implemented yet. You can see the active discussion here: https://research.arbitrum.io/t/time-boost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy-proposal/8173/31
undefined says Would it be correct to say that once the L1CustomGateway link is created, bridge will begin using the new contract and stop using the automatically deployed one? Surely this would "orphan" any tokens bridged before linking?
undefined says 📷Hey friend from arbitrum!  I hope this message finds you well. I stumbled upon your community and was blown away by how awesome it is! I wanted to share with you a cool project that I believe could make your community even better.  We've created a social platform called OpenCord that's perfect for DAOs.

We're really excited about this project and would love to chat with you more about it. You can find us at https://opencord.xyz.  Looking forward to hearing back from you soon!
undefined says Is it possible to get L2 block info from feed relay? I see that I only get L1 Message that contains L1 Block info and L2 messages.
undefined says I see there's a function in `arbos` pkg named `ProduceBlock`, could that be answer to my problem?
undefined says іпрв
undefined says Yes, and yes. The old token will still exist on L2, although no new tokens will be minted when bridging from L1.
undefined says (Based on your previous messages, I assume you are building an indexer. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)
If you are running a node, it will read the messages automatically from the Sequencer feed and get you the information you need.
undefined says is it possible to estimate txn fees in solidity? I understand that arbitrum's model is different and I have to account for L1 fees as well but I dont see a way to get this in solidity.
in L1 chains I could just use gasleft() and tx.gasprice, but here that'd just be enough to estimate the L2 fees.
undefined says L1 gas is intrinsic, meaning that is charged before execution. So you can use gasleft() only for the gas left in L2.
undefined says so there is no way to get L1 gas?
undefined says When you are executing the transaction, the L1 gas has already been deducted. Can you give me a bit more of context of the problem you're trying to solve? We might find a workaround that way.
undefined says The address 0x1fccbe3369eada96887a3b2857b57bba65e83dc1 changed its balance in block 38399. But the only transaction we have in this block does not involve that address. Could anyone help me to understand that?
undefined says I need to charge users based on the cost of executing their transaction.
Its deducted from a mapping which stores the amount they have deposited
I need to calculate the txn fees on chain for this, and I cant have an authority vet for this fees.
undefined says Do you know why the addresses 0x18a08f3ca72dc4b5928c26648958655690b215ac and 0xcce5c6cff61c49b4d53dd6024f8295f3c5230513 change their balances in each block prior to Nitro?
undefined says For example, both addresses change their balances in block 41 but the only transaction we have in this block does not involve those addresses
undefined says Could you please explain it to me?
undefined says Could you try it without the protocols?
undefined says For what length does an arbitrum full node store blocks? Ex for eth, full nodes save the last 128 blocks. What is the history stored by arb nodes?
undefined says could you please help us with this? thank you @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says They're probably fee collectors
undefined says I haven't checked but I'd guess that if you queried where the network fee and the sequencer fee went pre-nitro against a classic node you'd get these addresses
undefined says post-nitro you can get a lot more info including all transfers with the `callTracer` tracer
undefined says Can one address claim ARB airdrop for another address?
undefined says Nope
undefined says 128 too
undefined says is the l2 block number available in storage somewhere?
undefined says it doesnt go well in forked tests since the foundry or hardhat evm wont be implementing those precompiles and block.number will always return l1 block number
undefined says Ah, hardhat and others fork currently doesn’t support those now, but we are working to support it in the future.
undefined says what is the current workaround
undefined says Please I made some deposit from Binance into my Arb Metamask account and it has not dropped in my wallet whereas the transaction is showing as successful
undefined says same prob
undefined says @Arbitrum Support
undefined says If you can see your balance at arbiscan.io, then don’t worry, might be your metamask’s show up errors or rpc errors.
undefined says have not seen mine just says indexing https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x57b42c621c69e8785605a7b50e1793a5613cc52b4d51fdaf3f13de874d6af531
undefined says Okay, thanks
undefined says Checked, it was confirmed, don’t worries.
undefined says Could you please take a look at my isssues. i've made 2 swapped from ETH into USDC yesterday it went thru but still have not received my USDC in my wallet. i've basically everything still cant see my USDC
undefined says Arbiscan is under maintenance now
undefined says You can ask this in #📬︱support
undefined says just chatted with @Pitty76  they sent me here
undefined says Transcation were success  and i have not received my USDC  for the entire day. its NOVA
undefined says Please provide your address
undefined says 0x1F105931bE2d040e42c30Dac9992Cb0b80cB6728
undefined says does that mean my funds are safe?
undefined says It’s safe
undefined says It seems you sold them: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1f105931be2d040e42c30dac9992cb0b80cb6728#tokentxns
undefined says I have checked the status on Arb scan with my Txid number and the status says successful yet my Arb has not dropped
undefined says as it drop now?
undefined says no, i swapped from 0.055 ETH to $105 USDC. its on Arbitrum NOVA not Arbitrum one
undefined says do u need my TX?
undefined says Answered at #📬︱support , this channel is for protocol questions, thanks.🙏
undefined says No it hasn't
undefined says open the support
undefined says done?
undefined says You can change to a new rpc in your wallet: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers and refresh.
undefined says Thank you. Is there a best practice for dealing with (maybe burning) old tokens or is the only option to leave them orphaned?
undefined says You can still bridge your old back to l1.
undefined says So bridge will send tokens from old (default) and new L2 contract to the same L1 contract? I guess that’s kind of obvious 🤔 Thank you for clarifying.
undefined says Yup, it can withdraw to l1 to the same l1 address, but it can no longer bridge to l2 to that old address.
undefined says Great. Is there a process for updating default contract info on Arbiscan (token image, links)?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs its sucessfull but no arb
undefined says i think you should write in support
undefined says You should see `ERC-20 Tokens Transferred:` field
undefined says You just need go to your token profile and you can find a button (3 points) then you can submit a form there.
undefined says Hey 
was this resolved ??
undefined says Last I tried this it required claiming the contract, which we cannot because we did not deploy it (default gateway did). Or did I miss something?
undefined says You can write a form here: https://arbiscan.io/contactus
undefined says Hey, I'm attempting to bridge a custom token between Ethereum and Arbitrum using the Arbitrum Bridge (https://bridge.arbitrum.io/). However, I've encountered some issues during the process. I'm curious if it's possible to perform the token bridging using etherscan.io as an alternative.

The specific problem I'm experiencing with the Arbitrum Bridge is related to gas estimation, which results in an "execution reverted" error.
undefined says Thank you, I will do that, but the "Update Token Information Page" says that one requirement is that we have "been successfully verified as the contract address owner". We are not the owner of the contract that was deployed by default gateway? Should we just submit it anyway?
undefined says You can update your l1 token, send send a ticket through etherscan.io, this might be a good way to let etherscan team know this.
undefined says Yeah, you can do this, but you need construct the param like _maxGas _data and others, that might be a little difficult to do it manually, you can see how our script works: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit.
undefined says Btw, what issues do you encounter?
undefined says Tricky problem. I think (haven't verified) you could do an estimation if you know the size of the calldata of the transaction, but won't be exact. I would need more details about your architecture to see if there's anything else you can do to solve your problem. You can DM me if you prefer to share those privately.
undefined says while trying to bridge tokens on https://bridge.arbitrum.io/, I get this error:
undefined says It throw errors when trying to call approve token, and 0xdecaxxx is your token right? If so, you might need to check what going on with your token’s approval execution.
undefined says It should be approved already. I was already bridging WIS tokens for couple of months. Since last week I cannot bridge anymore. What do you mean by saying "check what going on with your token’s approval execution"? What and how can I check it?
undefined says i found the block timestamp only accurate to the second . but i found there is 3-4 block in 1 sec . how can i got the millsecond of the block ?
undefined says Yup, this error throw from WIS token contract(0xdecaxx), and the reason is because you want to approve unlimited number while can’t pass your contract’s check:

require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount);
undefined says Sorry, we use Unix timestamp so can only specific to second, so no millisecond can be checked.
undefined says I am trying to query a smart contract value on every block. I am using on new block subscription to do it. So the way it works is I query the contract on every block received. But this method skips few blocks in between randomly. Maybe the blocks are too fast or am I doing something different or is there a better way to do this? i using my own node.Thanks.
undefined says Can you provide instructions how to approve not unlimited number?
undefined says i need the block product time . is any more method  to get it ?
undefined says When you approve token, your wallet should ask how many token you want to approve. Or you can approve at etherscan too.
undefined says eth_getBlockByNumber
undefined says e .this api will get the same time of adjacent blocks  . for example 80339450 and 80339451 . i want to get the diff of these two blocks
undefined says As I said, because we use Unix timestamp, so we can only specific to second, can’t provide a more precise time.
undefined says Gents, I've I would love to check if our contracts would run smoothly on Arbitrum. But I can't find any (working) way to get any test coins for Arbitrum Goerli Testnet. Can't you point me out to some (or docs where I can find it), please?
undefined says We already have claimed and updated L1 contract on ES... not entirely sure what you mean in relation to updating automatic default gateway contract on Arbi? But I'll submit form soon anyway and see.
undefined says Hey, can you verify this? It seems that wallet is approved for fixed amount:
https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker?search=0x9dec204654cd4fade535d928908fdc65d2b03c98
undefined says Thanks for your answer. Do you know where we could find information about that without running a classic node?
undefined says Yo guys
undefined says I try to deploy a contract on arbitrum goerli, but when i deploy a simple ERC token it doesnt show any source code that needs to be verified. Does anyone know what is going wrong?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @Matt | Offchain Labs do you confirm that auragi platform is a native platform for arbi? Like velo for op
undefined says Cause i see many people want to stake , go there and stake their assets , if you are agree so plz start an ama with then to let people know them more and sure for safety @Maꭘ | Lemma @Ana 💙 Arbitrum
undefined says I'm afraid not
undefined says we do not handle those types of requests here, that team should reach out to `partnerships@offchainlabs.com`; this channel is for technical questions about development on Arbitrum
undefined says what do you mean, it doesn't show any source code that needs to be verified? What tool are you using to build & deploy? Hardhat?
undefined says I fixed it, does the arbitrum testnet have an arb token address?
undefined says thank you
undefined says just get Goerli ETH (from a faucet such as https://goerlifaucet.com/) and transfer to Arb Goerli via the bridge: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=421613
undefined says Yes, listed here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses#token
undefined says Is there a faucet for this token?
undefined says no; but the token doesn't really have any use on testnet other than testing core protocol contract upgrades on Goerli / Arb Goerli. If you want to test that functionality yourself, you're welcome to deploy a new copy of the contracts for yourself to own. For most cases, a simple mock $ARB erc20 would suffice for any app testing you want to do
undefined says I'm developing a token that I would like to be able to bridge from nova <-> one, is there any information about when this will be possible using the arb bridge, and what I should do to make sure it is compatible for it in the future when enabled?
undefined says I was scammed to connect and sign my wallet on a phishing NFT website that resulted in my loss of funds, as 233 ARB token of mine was transferred to the hacker's wallet. This is very confusing, since I did not click approve for the mint transaction. I only clicked 'sign' to connect my wallet.
undefined says Is it possible to cancel/replace a transaction after it's been seen by the sequencer? i.e sending a replacement tx with the same nonce and higher gas
undefined says Sorry for your loss
undefined says Yes it’s possible send with a higher gas fee
undefined says Great, thank you!
undefined says You’re welcome
undefined says have a few questions for a backend dev on a upcoming project if anyone has the time for a quick chat
undefined says Backend to Arbitrum or backend to the discord server?
undefined says Arbitrum
undefined says Does it fix now, you can clean your website’s cache and try.
undefined says You can just drop it here, if you are an upcoming project, you can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Hey, arbitrum doesn’t order tx by their gas price bid now, but first come first serve, so it is impossible to use a higher gas price to replace a tx.
undefined says I saw the sequencer poster log, what does the prev delayed, current delayed, total segments below mean? Are the segments the transaction of the batch?

INFO [04-13|01:14:26.229] BatchPoster: batch sent                  sequence nr.=10 from=1037 to=1159 prev delayed=9 current delayed=12 total segments=148
undefined says Hey, the delayed here means the txns coming from delayed inbox, you can see more information about delayed inbox here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#inboxes-fast-and-slow, segments means the data sequencer posted to l1.
undefined says Any ETA on when pruning is gonna be available? I'd like to go back and have an archive node (only running a full node atm), I'd like to cap it to 6 or 12 months so the disk space requirements are somewhat capped.
undefined says hey, do i need an arbitrum node to track the L2 transaction? Or is an L1 Ethereum node sufficient? "On the node syncing stage, Arbitrum nodes read transactions from batches that were previously posted on L1 and have been executed." - (https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/faq) . Is it possible to somehow keep syncing with L2 transactions only by decoding(?) L1 transactions that contain sequencer's batches (without maintaining an arbitrum node or using an external arbitrum node provider) ?
undefined says Maybe next node version, but not sure.
undefined says You still need to run our node since we have some l2 specific tx needs use our code to decode.
undefined says Guys im trying to send all the balance from my wallet, but this one fails with max fee less than block gas fee. What am i doing wrong?

```
        const feeData = await ARBITRUM_PROVIDER.getFeeData();
        const txObj = {to: process.argv[4], value: BigNumber.from(1), gasPrice: feeData.lastBaseFeePerGas }
        const estimatedGas = await ARBITRUM_PROVIDER.estimateGas(txObj); // Need to estimate because of ARB L1 component

        txObj["value"] = balance.sub(estimatedGas.mul(feeData.lastBaseFeePerGas));
        txObj["gasLimit"] = estimatedGas;
```
undefined says On the other hand if i use gasPrice: feeData.maxFeePerGas instead, it is leaving atleast 1 dollar of ether balance in the account. How do i solve this
undefined says can't I somehow extract and run on my own the arbitrum node's functionality repsonsible for decoding L1 batches and syncing? since every transaction is sent to L1 in batch why is it not possible to extract data from this batches and track for example a number of confirmations on L1 of a particular transaction?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs ?
undefined says Of course you can do it if you use our node’s functionality, what I mean use standard geth directly may can’t process some tx which specific to arbitrum.
undefined says Might because the network gas price is increasing so what you got has already lower than the latest number.
undefined says Is there a discord specialized for devs who build on arbitrum?
undefined says Thank you for clarifying, much appreciated 🙏
undefined says Is there snapshot for goerli archive node?
undefined says No
undefined says thanks 🙌
undefined says Can anyone help?

We've just integrated Arbitrum One into our NFT Marketplace 

However, we're having issues with the images appearing in meta mask on both desktop and mobile devices.

For some context, we encountered a similar problem with OpenSea API not showing our the images of our Wyvern NFTs in Metamask. It was an issue to do with IPFS and so we moved to Pinata and fixed that. 

However, now our Arbitrum NFTs are not showing the image in Metamask. 

Any thoughts? Have any of you encountered this before?

Would love some guidance on how to fix it.
undefined says Can you query the url of your nft image onchain correctly?
undefined says Does `TransactionStreamer` create L2 or L1 blocks in `createBlocks` function (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/174496cf22fa5b3221ee61a03edd24aef14bccbe/arbnode/transaction_streamer.go#L1112)?  

I want to hook into `createBlocks` function and stream L2 blocks over message queue elsewhere
undefined says Uniswap fees for specific pools all display fee infor for a pool over a certain period like 24hrs for Ethereum. But this info is not showing for Arbitrum because of some issue on subgraph.
undefined says Can you give a pool as an example? I did not notice such difference
undefined says Hey there! 

We are deploying on Goerli to deploy soon on Arbitrum One. Do you have a way to get a bit more ETH than the standard Faucets from Moralis and QuickNode?
undefined says ARB-USDC (0.05%) displays no fee or volume info. It’s one of your biggest pools.
undefined says I see, thanks for the ping! It might just be a front-end error. Looking into it and will get back to you.
undefined says Where can I find info on how much an L2 tx is paying the L1 for calldata? I used to be able to find it on Arbiscan's Advanced TxInfo tab (L1 Calldata Paid), but is no longer available
undefined says like in here https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xab01b385a0d0b29f80fd7ae816180a5aad5fa382773d0568b485fbba2b390394#txninfo
undefined says If I wanted to bridge from L2 to L1 programmatically, it looks like like I need to call `withdrawEth` on the ArbSys L2 contract and then wait a week before the ETH is available on L1. Do I then call `executeCall` on the L1 bridge contract to get the ETH?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Hey, that'd be the "poster fee" in the advanced tx info. It's basically the fee paid to the poster for the L1 resources.
undefined says Yes! You need to execute that transaction by calling the executeTransaction() method from the outbox:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x0B9857ae2D4A3DBe74ffE1d7DF045bb7F96E4840#writeProxyContract
undefined says where can the source code for the state transition function referenced in https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#how-the-sequencer-publishes-the-sequence
be found?
I did a little looking around in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro but couldn't find it
undefined says The state transition function isn't a single function, but instead a theoretical operation that is executed slightly differently in disputes and in normal nodes. Generally, it involves the InboxMultiplexer in  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbstate/inbox.go and ProduceBlock in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbos/block_processor.go
undefined says ok I'll check it out, thanks!
undefined says does the poster fee include fees also include the L1 fixed cost? or is it just calldata?
undefined says I have an interesting case, maybe someone can help. When transferring ETH, I forgot to specify TO parameter when sending a transaction using the ethers library.

The transaction was successfully created after which an empty contract was created (which is very strange for me)

As a result, instead of a failed transfer, I received a created contract on which 0.098 ether

There are options to get these funds back to the wallet

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x37945f84052dc988097f8dc9287dc68c7fa2d7fa
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says did you ever resolve this issue?
undefined says Hey, the way in evm to create contract is send a tx without to address, so it is expected.
undefined says Yup
undefined says How do I use subscribe?
undefined says Subscribe what? You mean rpc?
undefined says why does querying post-nitro archive data point to full node docs? do i need full node or archive node if i need query >128 blocks old transaction and blocks?
undefined says If you only request tx and blocks, you don’t need to have archive mode.
undefined says if i want to eth_call on post-nitro block, which doc should i refer to? my use case just read-only
undefined says You mean eth_getTransactionByHash?
undefined says no, i mean eth_call, for e.g usdc balance at any of the post nitro-block
undefined says If so, you need archive mode
undefined says thanks, thats just `--node.caching.archive` flag right?
what are the current requirements for archive mode (post-nitro only)? if you could recommend aws instance type that would be great
undefined says 4 core and 16gb: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-an-archive-node#system-requirements , I am not sure about AWS instance.
undefined says In respect to this, debug_tracecallMany is unique method of erigon client. 

So do I need to sync this erigon only or if I do it with geth then I will  be able to use this method?

Sorry for buggin again on this.
undefined says i am mostly concerned with storage requirements, is 2tb still minimum and 128gb per week growth still correct number?
undefined says You’d better prepare a larger storage, might more than 3tb. Using a cloud disk might be expensive and if you want to run an archive mode, use your local machine might be better and it’s also easy to add new storage disk.
undefined says You mean your l1 node? If geth doesn’t support that rpc method, I don’t think your geth will serve this request, but you might ask this on geth’s discord for better.
undefined says No thats confirmed. Geth doesn't support it. 
Only Erigon does. 
So Erigon is 100% in this case right?
undefined says But if I sync the node with geth and once Arbitrium is synced then if I switch the L1 endpoint to Erigon. 

Does this works?
undefined says It works, nitro just use normal standard l1 rpc method.
undefined says Thank you.
undefined says whats current uncompressed datadir size?
undefined says Hey, but what is the logic to create an empty contract without functions?
Anyway, perhaps there is an option to withdraw funds back to the sender (selfdestruct or something like that)?
undefined says The tx without to is used to create contract, if there is no data, then that contract won’t contain any logic, so, I am afraid there is no way to withdraw your token back.
undefined says Checking
undefined says I am attempting to reconstruct pre-nitro data, but I only have access to a nitro node. It appears that certain pieces of information are missing. For instance, I am unable to retrieve gas data or the from_address of a createRetryableTicket using a transaction RPC data, as all these fields are returning 0 or null address.. If I had access a classic node would I be able to get that information?
undefined says Hey everyone, I'm currently compiling a list of documentation unclarities that I'm happy to share later on 🙂
Hope it's okay for me to ask some questions along the way!

According to the documentation, the sequencer cannot entirely censor but only delay transactions to be included. 
I was wondering though: Assume the sequencer is malicious and wants to censor an address A. That address A will post their transaction to the delayed inbox and wait for 24 hours to call `forceInclusion`. Wouldn't the sequencer be able to dequeue that transaction and simply not include it in the meantime? Meaning that it gets removed from the delayed inbox such that it cannot be force-included?
undefined says I wanted to know where I can find the addreess of the deployed rollupcore contract in etherscan <w ould appretiate your help
undefined says if you want to run a classic node, see: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node

it will give you access to data from
eth_call
eth_estimateGas
eth_getBalance
eth_getCode
eth_getTransactionCount
eth_getStorageAt
undefined says No, the sequencer cannot dequeue a transaction from the delayed inbox without including it. Inbox transactions have to be processed in the order of receipt. Messages are simply moved from the `delayedInboxAccs` to the `Inbox` and the Sequencer subsequently emits a number for how many delayed inbox messages it included in a batch. See: https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer#happycommon-case-sequencer-is-live-and-well-behaved and the "Unhappy" section after that
undefined says so if i wanted to get just L1 calldata fee (excluding all the fixed cost), where should I look?
undefined says could anyone point pls, where can I find an example/tutorial how to calculate gas limit with Javascript?
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses
undefined says see: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/gas-estimation
undefined says (specifically, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/gas-estimation/scripts/exec.ts)
undefined says That makes sense, thanks! - those sections didn't clarify whether the sequencer takes delayed inbox messages off-chain for batching and then moves them into the core inbox.

Another question: Assume again that the sequencer is malicious and tries to include a malicious and incorrect transaction (for which it isn't necessary to forge a signature). What mechanisms are in place to prevent the sequencer from doing so? Can validators challenge posted transactions?
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs 
I'm having some issues importing nitro into a go project 

the main issues are 
github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/arbitrum_types: cannot find module providing package github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/arbitrum_types
github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/arbos imports
        github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/precompilesgen: cannot find module providing package github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/precompilesgen

any idea how to resolve these issues?
undefined says Invalid tx will be reject by arbos and evm when others fullnode pick that tx. Tx is not state, so won’t be challenged in rollups.
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/#precompiles
undefined says Also the go-ethereum package, you should use: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum
undefined says when was the arb1 nitro snapshot last updated? and why is snapshot init url same irrespective of whether node needs to run in archive mode or not?
undefined says This snapshot (https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar) is nitro genesis db, so your archive node should sync from this genesis too, for pre-nitro archive data, you should see: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-an-archive-node
undefined says thanks, how long does it usually take to sync archive node?
undefined says fullnode needs around 5 days, archive will be longer than that.
undefined says I'm trying to run a local network for development but it seems like network is for some reason stuck and cannot move past init message.

https://pastebin.com/raw/ZD4mhGLx
undefined says I have also imported wallet to the metamask extension and all transactions fail for me, no matter how much gas I add (because probably sequencer can't move past the init msg).
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  does nitro support loading custom evm implementations as vm.evm parameter like geth?
undefined says I've created a github issue here
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1582
undefined says checking
undefined says Did you follow these instructions?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node

Try running a fresh clone of the repo, and maybe change to a branch different than master ( latest release is v2.0.13 )
undefined says For the fixed cost you have "L1 Fixed Cost". For the calldata cost you have "L1 Calldata Paid"
undefined says I've been running latest version and have followed instructions.
undefined says Try changing the branch to v2.0.13 (latest release). Oh, also make sure there aren't any other docker containers (related to the node) running from previous tests.
undefined says How do I know L2TxHash, when i use createRetryableTicket to sent a L1tx for depoist eth. I need know status between L1Tx complete and L2Tx complete
undefined says Heard, makes sense that tx aren't challenged.
However, who wins the dispute if one validator (e.g. colluding w/ sequencer) decides to consider an invalid tx in their state and another doesn't? Aren't there cases where the validator considering an invalid tx could win as they are referring and disputing a "correctly executed" (but invalid) tx on L1? Is there a different kind of dispute for such cases?
undefined says And resulting from the answers I got, is the following correct?
When any user submits an invalid transaction to the delayed inbox it will be eventually moved to the core inbox anyway, either by the sequencer or after 24hrs by force include. It will just not be considered by arbos.
undefined says If you use the Arbitrum SDK, you can wrap the tx receipt into an L1TransactionReceipt object, and use this method => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/message/L1Transaction.ts#L182
The resulting object will have a `l2DepositTxHash` field with the hash of the L2 transaction.
Please, let me know if that helps you.
undefined says Hey I have a question about calldata compression and its implication on the challenge protocol. I don't see where the on-chain challenge module decompresses the calldata, so what holds a sequencer accountable if they post completely garbage calldata?
undefined says is there a dashboard where I can see the proportion of filled arbitrum block space?

i think arbitrum block space was filled on april 3rd or so due to some heuristics, but i'd love a dashboard. Lets say.  . .next arbitrum hackathon?

basically I want this chart
(cant post links, can i fool the crazy moderator bot. . . lets seee)
>> etherscan.io/chart/networkutilization
undefined says If a challenge starts between those validators, the one that posted the assertion with the correct state root will win the dispute. The challenge system can break down the dispute to a single step of processing, that is executed on L1, so the invalid transaction will be proven to be false. You can read more about challenges here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/proving/challenge-manager
undefined says It will be considered by ArbOS when running it, either by the Sequencer or by a validator.
undefined says Any transaction has to run through the State Transition Function (STF) before obtaining the updated state root to be posted in the assertion (and those assertions are what's challenged). If the Sequencer posts invalid calldata, nodes will flag it when decompressing and running it through the STF, and only the correct assertions will be posted.
Does that answer your question?
undefined says https://dune.com/queries/1062990/1826082

nvm, thanks @gzeon | Offchain Labs  🫡
undefined says so arbitrum nearly ran at it's speed limit on April 17th, avg 5 million l2 gas used per second for the whole day. 

great, arbitrum is only going to get more expensive from here 😆 .

how was the 7 million speed limit benchmarked?

that's pretty much the limit of arbitrum scaling, 5.6 times the block space of ethereum, and in a bear market, the ceiling is already being touched. So. . . Nova? Zk-rollups on top? L3s? I guess L3s can be dapp specific and therefore more efficient in some ways, but does it really make sense to solve l2 block space limitations by. . .well spin up another l3 for more blockspace. The calldata still needs to get published, but talking about l2 block space here with the l2 speed limit
undefined says I can't understand it after seeing the quickstart on the Arbitrum website. Can you tell me where the basic source code is for issuing coins?
undefined says Arbitrum is evm compatible. Any token contract written in vyper, huff, or solidity will compile to byte code just fine and deploy on arbitrum 👍

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20

Here you go
undefined says With stylus, in the future, you can use rust or c++ or whatever compiled to wasm also 🐒

Wen stylus?
undefined says @shotarothank you i will study
undefined says Those separate categories on arbiscan r no longer available for newer txs, seems like they have been replaced by the general L1 poster fee
undefined says Gzeon to the rescue 🙂 
Thanks for sharing it back here, shotaro !
undefined says is AISHIB real or fake?
undefined says Oh, my bad, sorry about that. After the Nitro upgrade, both fees are merged into one single poster fee.
undefined says hey
undefined says im trying to deploy a contract but I cant. I get this error: 
```Gas estimation errored with the following message (see below). The transaction execution will likely fail. Do you want to force sending?
Returned error: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":"we can't execute this request","id":1242314338026029}```

The thing is that when i deploy an empty contract with just the constructor it works fine but when i add an import from openzeppelin it shows that error. im using remix to deploy the contract
undefined says contract is as simple as this
```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Token is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("token", "tk") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply * 10 ** 18);
    }
}
```
undefined says yes i do
undefined says Have you been able to deploy contact now
undefined says Thanks. So who provides data availability in those assertions? It seems to me that if the correct transaction calldata isn't required to be posted to L1,  a validator can always proceed with a different but still valid path of state transition and win any potential challenges. Essentially the fork choice is not enforced on L1. Correct me if I'm wrong.
undefined says The data hashes are still posted to L1
undefined says Is it a hash of the compressed data? If L1 doesn't trustlessly decompress and validate the hash, the challenger can still be grieved.
undefined says it does, the replay binary has decompression code that's used for both anytrust and non-anytrust chains
undefined says the replay binary being the L2 state machine that's being proven over
undefined says the replay binary also can't be non-deterministic because its instruction set is fully deterministic
undefined says So for non-anytrust chains (I assume arb one would be of that kind), during challenge, the datahash posted by the sequencer is part of the input to the replay binary, and thus validated?
undefined says The hash will be recorded at sequencer Inbox accs: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Bridge.sol#L131 , and use in rollups protocol here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/RollupCore.sol#L573 .
undefined says Exactly -- you can see how the WAVM `ReadInboxMessage` opcode's message is validated on-chain against the sequencer inbox's batch accumulator here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/8af02e08651a5d6c7a77ad074625b8815da7b06e/contracts/src/osp/OneStepProverHostIo.sol#L173

undefined says `debug_traceCall` should work as normal, but `arbtrace_call` I wouldn't count on

Earlier, i was fetching them block by block, but the block time for arbitrum is very less(20-25 blocks every 5 seconds) and i think i will get rate limited if i do it using this approach. Is there a better way to do this?

undefined says In this case, you need contact binance for better
undefined says There is no priority fee needed currently on arbitrum network, for how our gas price work, you can see: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas
undefined says That Arbitrum foundation means the token’s name, not the target your token transferred to, your token transferred to an unknown address, your wallet might be hacked.

undefined says You should install hardhat first: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#overview
undefined says What is the appropriate gasLimit for transferring ARB tokens on the Arbitrum One chain? For example, a standard ETH transfer requires a gas limit of 21,000 gas units.

That being said, I wonder if I'm calling it right. The only params I'm changing in the api call are 'to' and 'apikey'. Am I supposed to be changing the other params as well? Like 'gas' or 'value' I left the same as the example but I'm wondering if I'm supposed to provide that...
undefined says Like `eth_estimateGas` it returns an amount of gas; you need to multiply that amount by the current gas price which you can get from the latest block header's baseFee
undefined says hey,
Sequencer is just picking txs, ordering them and send them on-chain. So the output for sequencer feed is the ordered txs. Arb nodes when receive data from sequencer feed, will calculate the outcome locally. 
Also Arb nodes will check for L1 confirmation of the batch posted by sequencer to L1 inbox. If the order changed, node will re-org to the L1 result.
On the other hand validators just use L1 confirmed batches posted there. So they don't care about sequencer feed. Validator will pick up ordered txs there, execute them, create RBlock and send them to L1.
undefined says Do you mean ARB token on testnet?
undefined says It is confirmed but not redeemed on Ethereum yet. Go to the bridge webiste and claim your tokens there. You need to send a tx on Ethreum to claim it. Feel free to ask question on #📬︱support If you hit any issue
undefined says Hey guys is there anyway to get testnet ethereum? The faucets don't really give me a bunch and i'm launching about 10 testnet contracts
undefined says It’s correct, since arbitrum’s block time is much faster than ethereum, so the gas price changes will be fast too.
undefined says You can try this one: https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/
undefined says Are there alternative ways for a faster withdrawal?
undefined says You can find those 3rd party bridge here: https://portal.arbitrum.io/ , official bridge needs 7 days.
undefined says is there a doc explaining about this portal? For instance, ways to set up or how it works? Can't seem to find one myself, thanks!
undefined says You mean add another project to it?
undefined says https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezhBlPgKIKKWgXKUz4MmlJPdHyfmPQlxUtS48HlRoi0e14_Q/viewform
undefined says For example, in Polygon there is an FxPortal where we can customize a faster withdrawal. I was wondering if there is an Arbitrum portal where we can customize the bridge/portal.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Is the pending blocktag valid for the fromblock parameter when I subscribe to logs using eth_subscribe
undefined says Oh, this portal I send to you is for arbitrum project listing, it has a lot of projects live on arbitrum, it’s not a bridge. And since we have a different mechanism to polygon, so we don’t have that one, but you can find 3rd party bridge provide fast withdrawal on our portal.
undefined says Thank you for the reply! I still have one question. It seems like the 3rd party bridge must have utilized the arbitrum core. But how did they manage to create a faster withdrawal if it abides by the arbitrum's 7 days withrdrawal period? 

May I get the brief explanation about how the 3rd bridge can manage a faster withdrawal using arbitrum?
undefined says You mean tag like newHeads? It supports.
undefined says how recent is this ser?
undefined says They use liquidity bridge way.
undefined says November 2022
undefined says None
undefined says Oof
undefined says Whenever I launch arb-node (arbitrum classic node) it executes reorgCheckpoints and it takes about 10 hours. So I have to wait 10 hours whenever restart the arb-node. 
Is this step necessary? 
How can I disable reorg step?
```
Apr 24 17:34:17 ip-10-20-1-234 bash[2513978]: Reorg took 37413986ms
```
undefined says Can I call NodeInterface.getEstimateComponents() function without arbitrum-sdk? I only want to use ethers.js
undefined says For example, if I call ethers.js by passing NodeInterface's abi, does it give the same result?
undefined says my arb-node's previous checkpoint is always timestamp 0
undefined says a web3 http call to my local node RPC endpoint takes about 4-5 seconds, is there a way to speed it up. Shouldn't it be caching data at least a few latest blocks (I am using a nitro full node)? Thanks.
undefined says Does anyone know why this happens?
undefined says This is normal check, classic needs a few hours to start.
undefined says Yeah, it will give you the same results.
undefined says What type of the call? eth_call or eth_sendTransaction
undefined says everytime?
undefined says yes
undefined says Should I use NodeInterface.checkConfirmation to check if the transaction in L2 is fully finalized? Or is there a rule that says no rollback after a certain number of confirmations?
undefined says It’s a contract call (read only ) actually. Using multcall to do that. It is actually calling a few different contracts in it. But shouldn’t it still be quicker if it’s on my local node. It almost takes the same time as public rpc.
undefined says why my previous checkpoint is always  null?
```
Apr 25 06:50:45 ip-10-20-1-234 bash[2691982]: Previous checkpoint,  total gas used: 0, L1 block: 0, L2 block: 0, log count: 0, messages count: 0, timestamp: Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970
```
undefined says I am following this https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway to create a custom gateway between L1 and L2, but I could not find the Arbitrum Addresses on Testnets, such as L1CustomGateway & L1GatewayRouter, where should I find all the testnets addresss like https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses ?
undefined says He guys I'm bridged arb nova to eth mainnet my transation 12 days complted still not receved anyone help me 🥲
undefined says Hey, that table contains those addresses for our testnet too. You'd need to scroll to the right and find them under the "Nitro Goerli Rollup" which is our testnet.
undefined says Hey, can you please post your question in #📬︱support ? Our folks are able to help you there.
undefined says does anyone get this error when sending rpc calls? I see it very frequently. I'm using ankr. `missing revert data in call exception; Transaction reverted without a reason string`
undefined says I'm with transpose.io, we're an on-chain data indexing service. One category of data we index is bridge data. Would someone here happen to know how exactly to determine the difference between bridging using Arb's native bridge for the following:

1) Arbitrum -> ETH
2) Arbitrum -> Nova
3) Nova -> ETH
4) Nova -> Arbitrum
undefined says Hey, I believe you can differentiate different tx types using the `kind` field of our bridge event `MessageDelivered` : 

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/c186ba35b1c5eb635412f23d5badc623579810b0/contracts/src/bridge/IBridge.sol#L11

For more details, I'd encourage you to look at one our subgraphs:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-subgraphs/blob/master/packages/arb-bridge-eth/src/bridge.ts
undefined says hey folks, i'm having an issue verifying a contract on nova. here's the error from hardhat-etherscan:

```
Error 1: Failed to verify implementation contract at {my contract address}: The Etherscan API responded with a failure status.
The verification may still succeed but should be checked manually.
Reason: Fail - Unable to verify. Invalid or not supported solc version, see https://etherscan.io/solcversions for list
```

however, if I go to https://etherscan.io/solcversions or https://nova.arbiscan.io/solcversions, my compiler version is listed (0.8.19). any ideas?

(@pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st asked me to drop this question here)
undefined says thanks for the response. In particular, is there an association in the 'kind' field between whether tokens were bridged to ETH vs Nova if one is bridging from Arbitrum?
undefined says I have a question. Is MEV on arbitrum a thing considering that it doesn't have a mempool?
undefined says Hey, please check if you write the same compiler version compare to your contract compile, and if so, sometimes if arbiscan under maintenance, it will also show up this errors, you can try it later
undefined says We have different bridge and inbox for different network routers: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses
undefined says It should not, but if you send your tx to an rpc provider, and they may order your tx first then send to the sequencer.
undefined says It is initializing, does it ok now?
undefined says Please confirm this message
undefined says You should use the `finalized` block number, which waits for the sequencer to post a batch and that batch to be finalized on L1.
undefined says How can I get `finalized` block number? Can you provide an API endpoint or related documentation?
undefined says You can call eth_getBlockByNumber with param `finalized`, also you can set this to `safe`, which is same to ethereum’s safe guarantee.
undefined says At what block number did nitro upgrade happen?
undefined says Was it at the block num 22207823?
undefined says thanks Mahsa, the transaction fails when I am making a call to this function registerTokenOnL2() from the TestCustomTokenL1 contract. The error is reason: 'cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit',
  code: 'UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT',
I am wondering if the parameters I am inputing is wrong, could you gave me a sample value of the input parameters for this function call?
undefined says 22207817
undefined says There is no fixed sample value for the param, you can see how we get those in this tutorial: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging
undefined says https://twitter.com/AlienAI_Arb/status/1651160561793777667?s=20
undefined says guys i need  faucet can you please help me,  from  where i can find ?
undefined says any one on this issue, please
undefined says anyone running nodes here for 1 mth ?
undefined says Hey there! I am Larry from Santiment team and we want to export arbitrum bridge transactions from events. Needed info: bridged tokens, token amount, sender / recevier;
Is it possible to extract such information from the `MessageDelivered` event by the bridge contract? Or what is the best practice for doing this? 
Thanks a lot!
undefined says Hey, discussed this with the etherscan team and it should be resolved now. Could you try again and let us know?
undefined says I'm trying to install a classic node following this guide https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node 
but I don't know how to use the snapshot to run it. Can someone help me? I have the db.tar decompressed but how do I tell the node to use it? @Mahsa | Offchain Labs @davidb | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is there a way to get L1 block hash from L1 Message?
undefined says Is anyone else having issues building `nitro` using the provided Dockerfile? 
```# github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/arbnode
arbnode/node.go:840:81: cannot use arbInterface (variable of type *ArbInterface) as type arbitrum.ArbInterface in argument to arbitrum.NewBackend:

make: *** [Makefile:167: target/bin/nitro] Error 2```
undefined says looks to be working fine now. thank you!
undefined says you would need the transaction hash. Given the hash, you can either plug it into Etherscan or if you want to fetch locally, you can call `eth_getTransactionReceipt` and the `blockHash` is in the result (can also use Ethers.js `provider.getTransactionReceipt` call)
undefined says https://twitter.com/PepeRobot_Arb/status/1651377356223938562?t=7aBTfgt2ByEUnVtPvaOWeA&s=19
undefined says Hey folks, I'm trying to understand about Arbitrum's Optimistic Rollup. I understand that verifiers stake a certain amount of collateral to an account. 

- How much ARB are verifiers required to stake as collateral?
- Are there any requirements for someone to become a verifier?
- If a verifier was found out to be recording fraudulent transactions, the verifier forfeits some of the collateral. How much of the collateral would they forfeit?
undefined says hey team 👋 i've been hit by a problem in nitro dev environment where the docker hub does not have an ARM image for blockscout, it's defined in this github issue:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1570

Does the team have plans to publish a blockscout container image to the hub?
undefined says Hi, we call it validator not verifier, our stake token is eth, and now the base stake is 1 eth, you can query it here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35#readProxyContract
2. Now validator doesn’t open register.
3. All the staked token they will lost all stake.
undefined says You should checkout to the version branch (v2.0.13), and then build docker.
undefined says Yes, but we have a few types of the messages, different message type has different decode way, you can walk though the code to get the details: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Inbox.sol
undefined says Hi....Please help me resolve my issue. My support ticket #1034882 is going nowhere. Requesting you to intervene and help me resolve this Claim Error. I bridged tokens from Arbitrum One to mainnet and status is Funds are ready to be claimed on L1. When I connect to L1 and click on Claim, I get this error " Cannot claim withdrawal: call revert exception [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-CALL_EXCEPTION ] (method="latestConfirmed()", data="0x", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.7.0)" Responses from Support has been absolutely unsatisfactory. They don't seem to be able to explain to me whats actually causing the error. It's been over 10 days now. I've tried Chrome, Safari under both Windows and MacOS...same error. PLEASE HELP!
undefined says Screenshots and TXID are attached to the support ticket
undefined says I need to get my contract verified on Arbiscan.io but I haven't got an email from the team in over 2 weeks after submitting my details again
undefined says Thank you for answering!
undefined says there is likely an issue with the contract code that is preventing the transaction from completing successfully.
undefined says Oh, the error reason you post is not because the claim tx will revert, it other things, you should change to another rpc and try. I just simulate your tx, it won’t fail.
undefined says Thank you.
Could it be possible to know with the confirmCount of the transaction? I wonder if there is a safe confirmCount number that won't roll back.
undefined says There is no such a fixed confirm number in l2, because different batch has different tx count.
undefined says Where can I find the code that converts the arbos+geth in wasm and the wasm in wavm?
undefined says If Arbitrum is a governance token, then whats the native token for Arbitrum One? Is it ethereum or?
undefined says To answer my questions, seems like ETH is the native token
undefined says More questions coming in from me 😹 

How are gas fees distributed? Do nodes receive any gas rewards? Also is only L2 gas fee distributed and how could I derive only L2 gas for a Tx from types.Transaction?
undefined says You have information about gas usage in these pages => https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas AND https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing

For fees distribution, kindly check the latest transparency report from the foundation as it covers fee distribution => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup#3-on-chain-dao-governance

Not sure what your last question means, but you can find gas usage for L1 and L2 in arbiscan (Advanced TxInfo tab in any transaction), or calling the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` RPC method
undefined says So I guess in the receipt `gasUsed` is L2 gas and `gasUsedForL1` is obviously for L1? `cumulativeGasUsed` field would be L1 + L2?
undefined says `gasUsed` is both L1 + L2.
`gasUsedForL1` is L1
For L2 it would be gasUsed - gasUsedForL1
`cumulativeGasUsed` is all the gas that has been used in that block including that transaction
undefined says Thank you, you're awesome! 🎉
undefined says I’m installing a classic node with docker, using the latest snapshot (as indicated in the guide https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-classic-node). I’m setting the decompressed db snapshot as a volume in the mainnet/db and it’s taking it because I see that the l2 checkpoint is in block 22M.

However, when I try to query it through rpc, I get the error ‘curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer’.
Previously, I had installed the node without the snapshot (and synchronization had started) and the rpc returned the data correctly.

Do you know what could be happening or do you have any recommendations on what to try next? Thank you
undefined says how comes the gas pr1ce volatility on arbitrum goerli? Sometimes a tx uses 100k on another day we need 100m for the same..will that change?
undefined says https://testnet.arbiscan.io/blocks?p=7555

this was yesterday...all blocks use between 300 and 800k
undefined says Your modding rules are way too hard..its not possible to have a discussion about gas when you ban the word "pr1ce" and now after 3 messages I am in slowmode...
undefined says Hey. I want to check node's status via `eth_syncing` but I receive follow data:

`{ 
  batchProcessed: 173750,
  batchSeen: 173750,
  blockNum: 84814742,
  broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos: 62606928,
  lastL1BlockNum: 17137208,
  lastl1BlockHash: "0x018db0dc3bb8b68a11a80db5229a6a38de96fa5a06d8f42173f7c5a5c2503088",
  messageOfLastBlock: 62606926,
  messageOfProcessedBatch: 62606737,
  msgCount: 62606928,
}`. How can I understand node status by this data?
undefined says Can you verify that the node is running correctly and that you're querying the right host+port?

If yes, please send the docker run command you use to start your node, and the RPC request  you're sending to it
undefined says Gas price depends on the underlying L1 chain. Spikes in Ethereum Goerli affect the price on L2 : https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs any idea why I keep getting stuff like `attempt 1 failed: stream error: stream ID 3; INTERNAL_ERROR; received from peer` when downloading initial snapshot from docker run command (running a nitro node)? this is with the recent tar. Everytime this happens it restarts the download ....

its happening seemingly randomly. would it be better to download that tar manually?
undefined says Hey! Let's see if this information can help you:
- `lastl1blockNum` is what L2 sees as current L1 state. If that's behind it's probably a problem with l1 supplier.
- `blockNum` is what's the up-to-date L2 block we're synced to
- `messageOfLastBlock` is the message number of that block
- broadcasterQueuedMessagesPos > msgCount, which shows you that the feed is ahead of the messages we received. This node is not in sync because it missed messages from the feed. It will soon get these messages and be in sync.
undefined says Hey! There are some changes being made on snapshots. Try with this one : https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar
(nitro-recent is being redirected there anyway)
And if that still doesn't work, try downloading it manually, yeah.
undefined says The docker run command I used was:
sudo docker run --rm -it -v /home/user/arbitrum-mainnet/db:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet/db -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url=<l1_rpc_private_url> --node.chain-id=42161 --core.checkpoint-gas-frequency=156250000

The curl I used is:
curl http://localhost:8547 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["0x63",false],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'

The node is running and this is the log (it's been running for hours)
undefined says oh thats awesome that ya'll create pruned. ya it's still failing intermittantly so gonna try manual i guess
undefined says Volume mount point should be `/home/user/arbitrum-mainnet:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet`
undefined says When I run in like that, the node starts syncing from scratch (from block 0) . I want to use the snapshot  "Latest classic snapshot for Arbitrum One: https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar". How should I mount the snapshot if not mounting the db?
undefined says How do I change to another RPC in trust wallet? Need steps as I don't see anything in TW under node settings (under preferences) that is editable. My Ethereum network just just shows Node 1 & Node 2 with block heights...thats all. I can't add another mainnet for ETH as one chain already exists...give me a solution please for connecting through TW and claiming my tokens.
undefined says Also, I sent you a DM...please check it
undefined says How do i find out how large my L2 txn's L1 data is?
It mentions Size of data to be posted in bytes (L1S)
Any info on how i get L1S ?
undefined says You should download and then decompress it and put those decompressed files to the mount point.
undefined says You can use this to get the estimate l1 part has: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L84
undefined says When Arbitrum node try to sync with latest blocks, where block data come from?
Sequencer or L1 Ethereum node or Aribtrum node or something?
undefined says You can both sync from sequencer or l1, but l1 has some delay since you need wait sequencer to send it to l1.
undefined says L2 node doesn't communicate with L2 nodes when syncing blocks, right? If I install it according to the Arbitrum docs, do I get it from L1? What will be the default settings?
undefined says They don’t, arbitrum doesn’t have p2p node so fullnode a won’t communicate with each other’s. You need to set --node.feed.input.url=‘’ if you don’t want to subscribe sequencer feed.
undefined says Thank you. I got it!
undefined says Is there a way to get L1 Tx hash where batch was submitted from `L1IncomingMessage`
undefined says I want to somehow relate L2 transactions to L1 transaction in which it was submitted to the L1 chain
undefined says @pyropy
undefined says I don''t have a technical issue, I just want to know how do L2 transactions relate to L1 transaction on protocol level 😄
undefined says There is `prevMessageCount` and `newMessageCount` in `addSequencerL2BatchFromOrigin` you can use it to add 22207817, you will get the related l2 blocks range, you can also reverse do it.
undefined says How does sequencer receive tx that they need to order on L2? Is the tx transferred p2p from node -> sequencer or? How can I know sequencer address?
undefined says Is the sequencer anonymous in the network or not? It's interesting to me to know how does one RPC node know where to forward the message in order to get receipt for it.
undefined says hey folks, as @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st suggested duplicating my question here in regards to the official arbitrum bridge

Why is it impossible to bridge USDT to Nova but it works for ArbOne? I'm getting The Arbitrum bridge does not currently support USDT, please ask the USDT team for more info. is there public information about that? I can see on the arbscan that some amount of USDT was bridged previously

The bridged contract https://nova.arbiscan.io/token/0x52484e1ab2e2b22420a25c20fa49e173a26202cd#code seem authentic and points to the original USDT on mainnet.
For some reason  it's impossible to attach screenshot in this channel. Basically, when you select USDT from mainnet to Nova official bridge disable button and shows under the amount input This token can't be bridged over.
undefined says you can use the findBatchContainingBlock method on the NodeInterface "precompile"; see this tutorial https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/l1-confirmation-checker/scripts/utils.ts#L67
undefined says the offchain labs public RPC endpoint *is* the sequencer; third party node providers connect to it via sequencer feed websocket
undefined says I don't want to be noisy but BUMP in case if this question got lost
undefined says Here we go again🤯 Can somebody explain the transaction please?

undefined says where link for faucet testnet arbitrum goerli ser?
undefined says Hey, we are looking into this and will get back to you soon! :arbiblobblue:
undefined says is the NodeInterface the one at `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8` ?
undefined says Hello!

Is there a way I can get L2 blocks based on a L1 block?

I have a smart contract that includes `block.number` when emitting events and an app that relies  on those events, which works fine for all chains where I have my contract deployed except for Arbitrum because `block.number` refers to L1 block.

Thanks in advance :)
undefined says 
undefined says Arbitrum NOVA Will airdrop?
undefined says Are there any plans to have arbitrum sepolia?
undefined says not sure if this is the correct room, but its in the developer section so here goes:

When I do a transaction on say uniswap I get the hashCode in the txnReceipt. If I look at arbiscan then the transaction status is immediately available (succeed/fail)

However if I run txn.wait() I have to wait for like 60 seconds for finality.

Is there a way to get the transaction status before it has been confirmed please ?
undefined says I'm not sure what library you're using, could you link its docs for `wait()`? It might be that it isn't polling frequently enough or something, because the receipt should be available almost immediately
undefined says I'd see if you can lower its polling interval somehow assuming it has one
undefined says hey guys! on my local node, Im making an rpc READ eth_call to a contract. I know that call returns a lot of values (array of thouseands of addresses). The eth_call crashes/reverts on my local node though (same call works fine with infura/alchemy). Are there any node settings I have to modify to allow for this type of call to not revert?
undefined says I would like to know if there is any way for me to be eligible to receive the Arbitrum network coin airdrop.
undefined says @MEE6 I would like to know if there is any way for me to be eligible to receive the Arbitrum network coin airdrop.
undefined says I am getting an error HTTP error: 429 Too Many Requests when starting the node. Why is this hapenning? I tried refreshing the server with a new IP so I havent done any requests at all
undefined says Is thers any RPC providers or public RPC that supports "eth_sendRawTransactionConditional" for Arbitrum or Arbitrum Goerli ?
undefined says Our public Arbitrum Goerli RPC `https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc` supports it 🙂
undefined says Thank you, it would be great if debug_traceCall is enabled too 😀
undefined says You'll need to use a 3rd party RPC for that because it has potentially unbounded resource consumption
undefined says Hey team - wondering if there is a reason why the token contract that is created upon bridging to Arbitrum - doesn't show any read/write functionality on Arbiscan? Is there a way to enable this quickly/ something else needed to be done? TY!
undefined says @here any suggestions as to what the best alternative for chainlink VRF might be on arbitrum ? Bummed to find out that chainlink vrf v2 is not yet supported on arbitrum . Need a random number for NFT minting provenance
undefined says how about `https://twitter.com/RandomizerAi`
undefined says Is it reliable
undefined says In case you're interested in Rollups:
https://twitter.com/LEVXeth/status/1652954581184438272
undefined says so I'm using ethers. but I also used curl eth_getTransactionByHash and I didnt see the receipt for 60 seconds. 

Then I queried the sequencer on  https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc and it was there in around 2 seconds.

Now i'm seeing an issue where that looks like my wallet is out of sync: if I send a transaction I cannot send another one for 60 seconds (approx) - ie after something has confirmed. 

this is the error message: 

```{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":67977,"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"nonce too low: address 0x1Eb36d9F5D65de272868D2eb734bA43587f6f468, tx: 811 state: 812"}}
undefined says .
this whole sequencer thing is not clear in my mind - should I submit tx to the sequencer directly, or my RPC ? How much traffic can the sequencer handle ? If it goes down can my rpc node submit txn ?

also if I want the most up to date data should I listen to the sequencer rather than poll my RPC node ?
undefined says It sounds like your RPC node isn't properly syncing, are you sure it's connected to the sequencer feed? Try checking its logs.
undefined says Hey, I have a quick question about the incentive mechanism of validators.
According to the docs, a portion of user transaction fees are paid to the validator submitting the state. On the other hand, it seems like there is only one active validator run by OffChain Labs and all the other whitelisted validators are merely defensive.
Why wouldn't a defensive validator turn active to receive some of those transaction fees? The docs mention that more than one validator is a waste of resources, but how does the protocol currently deal with "competing" active validators?
Thanks for your help! 🙂
undefined says Why it seems I cannot cut time of sending a transaction down despite trying dedicated servers around the US?

Websocket responses come as quick as 2 ms yet sending a transaction seems to take 300-500 ms
undefined says Furthermore, could someone point me to docs regarding the incentive mechanism around fraud proofs? As active and defensive validators need to be staked, I assume there is some kind of slashing - I'd love to learn more about what the incentives are to submit fraud proofs, if there are any disincentives to submit invalid states (and how strong they are), and if there is a disincentive to submit invalid fraud proofs.
Thanks again!
undefined says thanks response Lee - I bounced the node and checked the logs. Technically its another team that maintains nodes and not my specialty area, so with that in mind :

what should I look for in the logs pls? there is nothing that says its connected to any sequencer ?

```

undefined says Hey, can you send the contract address?
undefined says QRNG by API3 is also available:
https://docs.api3.org/reference/qrng/chains.html
undefined says We have a load balancer in between. Also we don't have a mempool on Arbitrum, so txs are first come first serve ordered.
undefined says Currently we have a set of validators whitelisted. We're working on the next generation which would be shipped soon that will allow us to remove whitelist. More info here:

undefined says Hey @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs thx for the help! Yeah it actually shows up just fine and correct in Arbiscan - with the token contract details and everything - just appears the ABI is missing or something needs to be added? (Token deployed on Mainnet and bridged to Arb using official Gateway)

The contract is:

```
NFTE token contract:

0xB261104A83887aE92392Fb5CE5899fCFe5481456

```

undefined says Hey guys, unable to verify contracts on Arb Nova, with the Arb Nova api keys from the explorer. Using proper hardhat config still 
Getting this error: 
```
NomicLabsHardhatPluginError: Trying to verify a contract in a network with chain id 42170, but the plugin doesn’t recognize it as a supported chain
```
Can someone help
undefined says It sounds like you're having trouble verifying contracts on Arb Nova using the API keys from the explorer. One possible reason for this error is that the API keys are not correctly configured in your hardhat config file. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Double-check your API keys: Make sure that you have copied the API keys correctly from the explorer, and that there are no typos or errors in the keys.

2. Check your hardhat config file: Make sure that you have correctly configured your hardhat config file to use the API keys. Check that you have set the correct network ID, URL, and API keys in the config file.

3. Check your contract code: Make sure that your contract code is correct and matches the code that you deployed on Arb Nova. If there are any discrepancies between the deployed code and the code that you are trying to verify, the verification process will fail.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
undefined says Awesome, thanks a lot for this!
One question that is not answered there: 
Are validators rewarded for submitted states (after confirmed)? Or is there currently no incentive system to actually submit states?
undefined says Hey have done all of these, I have deployed correctly on Arb One and Arb Goerli. It's just Arb Nova is giving this error. Want to know if verifying contract is even possible on Arb Nova via the api keys from hardhat
undefined says Hey, no, there's no reward for that. Running a validator helps to to participate in the ecosystem, Note that you'll obviously get some rewards if there is ever a dispute in which you win.
undefined says Hey, I'm looking into this and will let you know!
undefined says Any idea why some of my trxs just fail for no reason?

"Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [execution reverted] " is all I get with Base: 0.1 Gwei |Max: 2.7 Gwei |Max Priority: 2.5 Gwei which should be plenty..
undefined says I'll submit the same trx with the same fee and get executed next time I do it. When I let ethersjs set my gas variables it will give me unpredictable gas limit and not send the trx but if I try and populate the values myself and send it, sometimes it goes through and sometimes it fails without any reason.
undefined says The contract is interacting with uniswap, simple swap.
undefined says @N@ Try disconnecting and reconnecting
undefined says if that's a joke, I like it, but otherwise I have no clue what you mean
undefined says Do you have Nova set up as a custom network in Hardhat? 

https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/main/packages/hardhat-verify#adding-support-for-other-networks

Hardhat is no longer adding officially supported networks for Etherscan verify, so while arbOne is supported out of the box, Nova has to be added manually
undefined says Hey, this might be mainly because our base price is increasing fast, and your node has some delays on this and when your tx relayed to sequencer, the price already increased, I would suggest you to set a little higher gasPrice when send your tx. (It will cost the same if you set higher, so you won’t worst your token)
undefined says Interesting, I'm using EIP-1559 so gasPrice is null, this is what I'm passing if the auto generate gas values from ethersjs fails 

```
          unsignedTx.maxPriorityFeePerGas = BigNumber.from("2000000000");
          unsignedTx.maxFeePerGas = BigNumber.from("2200000000");
          unsignedTx.gasLimit = gasLimit;
```

And it will still fail without an error message.

I get

- tx undefined - where trx is undefined coming back from api when pushing trade
- code: 'UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT'

Both where trades should succeed
undefined says Also is there a reason I see a lot of trxs have 0 for max priority?
undefined says If it's an arbitrage transaction, it is likely being delayed due to other arbitrage transactions being processed before you. The Arbitrum sequencer processes transactions atomically (1 by 1) so it can take a while to get a response if there are many transactions in the queue
undefined says We don’t charge priority fee on arbitrum, we use first-come-first-serve model, so when the gas price you set higher than the network base price, your tx will be included. Also, I see you set the gas price use a fixed value, you should call eth_gasPrcie each time to get the latest gas price, our gas price changes very fast by time, so fixed value doesn’t work at arbitrum, also you should call eth_estimateGas each too: https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says Nah, only an empty test transaction that is sent at block X and usually only done at X+2 no matter the node location
undefined says I see at least 5 arbitrage bots constantly making it to the first block (and even in the first positions implying they were super quick) so it got me curious. Maybe they are plugged into the sequencer lol 😅
undefined says Mind you not looking to do arbitrage stuff, don’t have the resources to compete with those guys
undefined says It depends on the queue length, even if you send a faster tx to sequencer, if the length of queue large, you still will be included in the second or later blocks.
undefined says Makes sense
undefined says Is there a queue? From the cli params I've got an impression that buffer is defined as max 100ms slot per block (with at least 1 tx)
undefined says I used the script provided and have 

```
{
  data: '0x...',
  to: '...',
  from: '...',
  gasLimit: BigNumber { _hex: '0x7f25eb', _isBigNumber: true }, // 8332779
  gasPrice: BigNumber { _hex: '0x05f5e100', _isBigNumber: true } // 100000000
}
```

But on chain the transaction reverts without error. It's also sent as EIP-1559 despite me only including the above values.

Using the script here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/gas-estimation/scripts/exec.ts and doing

```
  unsignedTx.gasLimit = G;
  unsignedTx.gasPrice = P;

  return unsignedTx;
```

I see under gas fees `Base: 0.1 Gwei |Max: 0.1 Gwei |Max Priority: 0.1 Gwei` and `Txn Type: 2 (EIP-1559) Nonce: 392 Position In Block: 2`

I also tried with `Base: 0.1 Gwei |Max: 0.2 Gwei |Max Priority: 0 ETH` and it's still failing.

What am I doing wrong?
undefined says hey just checking @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st  is team had a chance to look into the disabled USDT in the bridge? Now the message in UI has changed, it shows `Depositing is currently suspended for this token as a new gateway is being registered.`.  Is there any public activity/discussion about this to follow?
undefined says This seems to be working

```
  unsignedTx.maxPriorityFeePerGas = BigNumber.from("0");
  unsignedTx.gasLimit = G;
  unsignedTx.maxFeePerGas = P.mul(10);

  return unsignedTx;

undefined says Hey, https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x52484E1ab2e2B22420a25c20FA49E173a26202Cd is an old version of the USDT which was originally bridged though immediately afterwards it was switched to being custom bridged.
Long story short, to deposit USDT to Nova theough our bridge you must use https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xed9d63a96c27f87b07115b56b2e3572827f21646 (which is verified).
undefined says This is what you'll see if you enter the old contract:
undefined says Oh I see, thanks for answering my question. So even these are proxy contracts it's impossible to change gateway? I wonder how many similarly broken token it may produce.
So what was the initial reason to switch to the custom bridge?
undefined says You put the arbnova bridged token address into the mainnet box.. surely it doesn't exist 🙂
if you put the real mainnet's usdt https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7 it still prevents from bridging with the error message I put above.

undefined says Whаt is averаge priсe of cоntract deplоyment in Аrbitrum?
undefined says I've tried to deploy my contract and metamask have charged me a 62$ transaction fee. Is that normal for L2 ?
undefined says or maybe Team can add manualy 😀
undefined says On l2 you're _mostly_ charged for the calldata. Given that contract deployment has a lot of calldata it's not very big surprise. You also can wait for the less busy times to reduce L1 gas cost
undefined says I just picked up a random tx, check the 'advanced tx info' tab to get idea https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x8da9bbeadd6fde3050f610872bf70e2e9290335ff326ab7a1854a938b0b21ab1#txninfo
undefined says guys this is scam??or .. right one
undefined says scam
undefined says thank you
undefined says Understand. But I've meаsured cаlldata size (byteсode length in case of SC deployment) of 4 contracts. Their byteсode lengths and deplоyment cоsts are:
1) 234 bytes -> ~14$
2) 3213 bytes -> ~100$ 
3) 4615 bytes -> ~15$
4) 6586 bytes -> ~200$ 
All cоntracts whеrе writtеn by mysеlf and deplоyment аttempts wеre made simultаneously (so gаs priсe wаs the same)
undefined says So I am a bit confused, cause obviousely саlldata size and deplоyment cоsts don't match...
undefined says You probably missing the point of the rollups, calldata does cost much indeed, see a random tx I gave you as an example. In arbitrum they compress calldata so it's slightly cheaper than it could be otherwise but still significant. Contract code is calldata effectively, it'll be rolled up into L1.
undefined says Arbitrum charges based on compressed tx size. Try taking the calldata and feeding it on the command line to `brotli -0`, e.g. `cat input | brotli -0 -c | wc -c` to see how many compressed bytes it is
undefined says how accurate is it? and btw, it'd be great to see hardhat-gasreporter plugin to show gas for the arbitrum!
undefined says That just looks at the calldata, which is only part of the tx, so it'll be a bit off. The more accurate method is to use NodeInterface's `gasEstimateL1Component`, though it can never be perfectly accurate, because the amount of data a bit cyclically depends on the gas limit specified and the signature, because they're part of the tx data.
undefined says How much can gas spike? I'm putting max at 1 gwei and still seeing trxs fail. It's actually set to 10x base. Is there anywhere I can see these gas spikes in real time? The gas sites I saw don't really show hard spikes that would explain this.
undefined says are there any public ws rpc?
undefined says No, but you can use  3rd party service: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says The gas price will be affected by the network status, and since we have a shorter block time than ethereum, so the gas price change will be faster too.
undefined says What failed? eth_estimateGas?
undefined says arb   test  uniswap  adderrs？
undefined says How can I reduce contract bytecode size ? I know that using less storage variables may help.
undefined says Here are some additional tips that can help you reduce the contract bytecode size:

1. Use smaller data types: Use smaller data types like uint8 or bytes32 instead of uint256 or bytes to store data.

2. Remove unnecessary code: Remove any unused or unnecessary code from your contract. This can significantly reduce the bytecode size.

3. Use libraries: Use external libraries instead of writing all the code in your contract. This can reduce the size of the bytecode and also make the contract more modular.

4. Use modifiers: Use modifiers instead of writing the same code in multiple functions. This can reduce the overall size of the contract.

5. Use inline assembly: Use inline assembly code to optimize certain functions and reduce their bytecode size.

6. Minimize function parameters: Try to minimize the number of function parameters as each parameter adds to the bytecode size.
undefined says The transaction reverts.  Arbiscan just shows this:

```
Status: Fail
Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [execution reverted] 
```

Is there a way to get more details with another block explorer? What's interesting is using etherjs's default option to submit and estimate gas, i.e., not using the populate trx function, it just fails at the API level without spending the gas to send to the chain.

Though I'd like for the trx to succeed or to understand exactly how much gas is spiking to determine whether I actually want to spend the gas on the trx or not. I also tried a retry loop to retry the trx but that always fails with a 1s timeout and 10 retries which is odd.
undefined says You can try using vmtrace's functionality from Arbiscan (here's a similar example => https://developer.arbitrum.io/for-devs/troubleshooting-building#i-tried-to-create-a-retryable-ticket-but-the-transaction-reverted-on-l1--how-can-i-debug-the-issue )

If that doesn't work, send us the transaction hash and I'll take a look
undefined says Could someone point me to the piece of code where the sequencer deals with L1 re-orgs? I'm curious to learn what promises are made regarding transaction inclusion post re-org. Is there any assurance for inclusion at all? Or does the user have to re-submit transactions in certain edge cases? Thanks once again! 🙂
undefined says If an L1 reorg happens and it affects any of the batches posted by the Sequencer, it will not be able to post new batches until the one reorged out is posted again. There's a sanity check in the SequencerInbox contract that prevents that from happening => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/e71d3044aff80986e8ebc862053d7224ee478da0/contracts/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L361-L362

So the user won't need to do anything and the Sequencer will always maintain the established order of transactions.
undefined says so as I understand it, this relies on the sequencer providing the correct `prevMessageCount` and `newMessageCount` parameters? So it is essentially just a sanity check for the sequencer to not accidentally post later transactions after a re-org occurred? If that is the case, "maintaining the established order of transactions" is dependent on honest behavior of the sequencer, right?
I'm obviously viewing this through a very pessimistic security lens 🙂
undefined says If you're looking for what's finalized, querying the finalized block number on L2 will give you the latest blocks in a batch that's been finalized on L1, meaning it won't be reorg'd
undefined says Thanks for your answer! It's more of a very theoretical than practical question though
undefined says is there anyway to prune nitro node?
undefined says Upgrade your node to v2.0.14 and set init.prune when start
undefined says recently the network having high gas limit? swapping 10k usdt previously cost 2-3mil of gas, now is almost 10-20mil of gas
undefined says I reach out to share a great business idea if you are open ?
undefined says The gas usage depends on l1, when l1 gas price higher, the gas used on l2 will also higher: https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas#breaking-down-the-formula
undefined says If you already have a project, you can send email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says In the current model, batches are posted from the same account, so there's an added protection in the nonce of the transactions. If batch is "removed" it will "go back" to the mempool, so any subsequent transactions will have to wait for that one to be executed.
Does that answer your question?
undefined says Might be a dumb question but does the sequencer revenue go to the DAO treasury or offchain labs?
undefined says Revenues are used first to compensate what the BatchPoster (also the Sequencer in this case) has spent on L1, and the surplus goes to the DAO treasury
undefined says Apologize to send a question like this, but I don't know which word/sentence is blocked on this server ..
undefined says I'm new to Arbitrum , and im contributing to https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge repo , 

I'm facing a issue in e2e testing , I'm getting invalid private key error

I want to what should be the prvate key  in .e2e.env
undefined says error messAGE
undefined says are txs on arbitrum (not a withdrawal) subject to the challenge window as well? my thinking is that it would apply since a tx native to arbitrum (alice sends bob 1 eth on arbitrum) is included within a state commitment that's posted to L1, and all state commitments are subject to the challenge period

could someone help me clarify this?
undefined says I resolve that issue , it a linting mistake,
undefined says now i get a new issue when testing locally for missing local ethereum Rpc url , but no such thing is menitoned in testing guide
undefined says these are the steps for e2e testing with cypress
undefined says no i have not done that
undefined says We don't have a mempool, instead we have a queue on our sequencer that keeps track of received transactions. There isn’t space limit on our queue, but txs will be dropped based on a small timeout if they couldn’t get through. Our sequencer will pick transactions based on the order in the queue. So generally you won't be able to cancel the transaction once it's in the queue. Also, keep in mind that 0-gasprice txs won't get into the queue.
undefined says All L2 transactions go through the State Transition Function, producing a new state of the chain. This state of the chain is what's asserted on L1 and can be challenged. So yes, all transactions are subject to the challenge window.
undefined says You have to run a local nitro node to run the tests in your local environment.
You can find instructions on how to run a local node here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node

Thanks for flagging that in the repo documentation. Our team will cover those steps in more detail.
undefined says anyone got tips to help me deploy my first contract on arbitrum?
undefined says thanks @José FP | Offchain Labs  , going through the docs
undefined says One more thing, you need to set up .env.e2e file if you haven't done so. You will have to use these variables => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/63df90858212c8516531bc37329f28ccbc7ee31f/packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/.e2e.env.sample#L4.
PRIVATE_KEY_USER can be either your own wallet or any wallet really, but it has to have some deposits and withdrawals on the local network (15 should be sufficient) to run e2e on transaction history. (no mainnet or goerli txs will be made with this wallet, basically no funds will be spent there, only local funds which are unlimited)
undefined says There's a quickstart in the docs that can help you do that => https://developer.arbitrum.io/for-devs/quickstart-solidity-hardhat
undefined says Trying to deploy a token on Testnet via Remix but nothing is going through, even with max gas limit. Any help would be appreciated

undefined says The actual execution result is different from what I saw in the official documentation. Why is this happening?
undefined says what is the relationship between sequence number and block number now ?
undefined says Hey guys, so i have been having a hard time trying to understand how arbitrum works. I read almost all the documentation, and i think i understand the general idea but i still have some question, any help will be really appreciated. 
1. What exactly gets posted “stored” on ethereum, the transaction themselves before execution or the results “ Rollup State”? Also, what are assertions, i read that if a validator accepts the new state, it doesn’t need to do anything right?
2. Who exactly processes the transactions on arbitrum, the sequencer or the permissioned validators??
3. I know that Arbitrum is a rollup, not a separate chain like sidechains, so i am reading on the arbitrum homepage that the assertions are stored as Rblocks ( Rollup Blocks) on a separate chain and then these blocks are stored on ethereum???!! If this is true what is the difference between arbitrum and a sidechain??
Thanks in advance for any help

anyone know a fix?
undefined says You can also send tx to l1’s inbox directly.
undefined says You need set the gas price higher.
undefined says We can recognize this is because we extract msg.sender of l1 tx, but we will alias it so if you want to send tx on l1 via l1 and use the same sender, you should call `sendL2Message` directly.
undefined says Arbiscan is under maintenance, you can try it later.
undefined says Hey, 
1. There are da and state, the da is the tx on l2 which is posted by sequencer, then the state posted by validator later according to the da.
2. The sequencer only order the tx, when sequencer ordered the tx and sync the sequence to others, all fullnode and validator and execute it to get the latest state.
3. Side chain doesn’t store the da, which means you need trust the side chain’s node data. But on arbitrum, you can query the da from l1 and execute it locally to get the latest state, you don’t need to trust any of the node on l2 but just l1.
undefined says The sequence number is the nonce of sequencer posted tx, but block number is just the same thing as l1 block. Each sequence number can have many blocks number.
undefined says thx
undefined says Got it now, so the assertions (results of executing txs) get stored on L1, but we dont need to trust these results we can use the inputs also stored on L1 to get the latest state ourselves right?
undefined says Yes, for the state you can run your own node and trust it is fine, the l1 assertion is to let l1 know the l2 state so it knows the l2 to l1 txns results and release the related token.
undefined says Got it, thank you man for the help

undefined says You mean erc721? Our official bridge doesn’t support nft, not sure if 3rd part bridge support now or not.
undefined says yes using sushiswap it creates an NFT from the uniswapv3
undefined says You can see how to get it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/01cb1dc83/src/lib/assetBridger/erc20Bridger.ts#L498
undefined says theres things called peripherypayments in the uniswap docs i might try
undefined says arbitrum one
undefined says 200 million usd gas fee for write contract uniswap periphery functions - ermmmm
undefined says impressive but obviously a no
undefined says Your db might be crashed, you can restart your node and wait when it can successfully sync the chain then stop it by `docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq)` and prune it.
undefined says This is because this tx will be reverted.
undefined says sorry dont understand?
undefined says When tx will run fails it will show a super high gas cost.
undefined says ok, do you know how i get my funds out of the NFT?
undefined says Sorry, I am not sure about this. You can ask the nft issuer about this.
undefined says What wallets are safe to store ARB token?
undefined says it needs to be fully synced to prune?
undefined says Mm and trust wallet
undefined says Thank you, is that all ?
undefined says The two are the best and easier for newbies
undefined says Ledger doesn’t support it ? Im a comp sci undergrad — I might be able to figure out the tougher ones ..
undefined says It also supports
undefined says When I search I find it but it says Arbitrage, is it the same thing ?
undefined says 
undefined says No, it doesn’t need, this is to see if your database crushed or not.
undefined says You can manually add the token address: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says is nodeInterface working now?
When I try to call estimateRetryableTicket with estimateGas method, I got execution reverted.
undefined says Are inputs same as written in NodeInterface.sol?
undefined says 
undefined says I have a question about bridging:

1. I assume that I bridge  a quite standard ERC-20 token from ethereum mainnet. I'm not that project developer, but just want to have liquidity from this token on arbitrum.
2. If nobody ever bridged that assets, whats going to happen? Is it right, that then a standard ERC-20 on arbitrum is deployed automaticly, so its permissenless?
3. I assume it will have a different token address on arbitrum. Is there a listing which shows which ERC-20 mainnet token are mapped to which arb ERC-20 token?
4. Now the original token developer from mainnet comes in and is not happy with that bridged ERC-20 Arb token, what going to happen?

I did read the docs, but there is not much info about this.
undefined says Yo Is arbitrum goerli down?
i can't create any contract now
undefined says You should use rpc call not from contract.
undefined says Hey,
2. Yup, it will deploy a new one, it is permissionless.
3. The address is the alias of that l1 token: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing. And if your token listed in CMC list or Uniswap list, that will mapping to https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_uniswap_labs_default.json or https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_coinmarketcap.json
4. If that token deployed re-bridge it using our bridge and their token is standard implement, it has no affect, the token they bridge is also the same address as yours. If not standard way, they will use custom bridge way but your token can still bridge back to l1.
undefined says Thanks!  I did find some example. I did look at pepe, who has been bridget to arb 16 days ago..
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/token/0x35e6a59f786d9266c7961ea28c7b768b33959cbb

First tx https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x10bcbae0e7db3cb63446f491e73221c3c8ee74a3f78c7dac3cc4548486e5156f

As now one owns that token, I think info on arbiscan about that token can not be updated by anyone. And thanks for the tokenlist!
undefined says Np!
undefined says Oh, I see. I might not have been clear enough in my answer. All transactions are subject to the challenge window in the sense that all transactions pass the fraud proof period of 7-days. During those 7 days, any validator node who thinks the current state of the chain is wrong, might start a challenge with the node that asserted the current state of the chain. Fraud proofs are explained here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#resolving-disputes-using-interactive-fraud-proofs

But, L2-to-L1 messages (withdrawals and other messages that are passed from L2 to L1) are the only transactions that must wait for the full challenge period to be over to be fully executed.
Transactions that happen only in L2 do not have to wait 7 days to be executed. Actually, just a couple of seconds.
For completion, L1-to-L2 messages (deposits and other messages that are passed from L1 to L2) take around 15-20 minutes to be fully executed.
undefined says Hey guys! Trying to deploy on Arbitrum

But im having gas issues. Any ideas? :) Happy to provide more detail
undefined says I enabled the graphql api with --graphql.enable but the port doesn't seem to be opened (using netstat) when I add the flag.
undefined says @here Arbitrum Goerli is down. Any ETA on fixing this?
Edit: nevermind it just looks like  aproblem with Arbiscan
undefined says You mean without initiating contract instance and calling estimateRetryableTicket with .estimateGas(), call 0xc8 address with eth_estimateGas rpc method?
undefined says Do you have any examples for this call?
undefined says Hey guys, anyone else having trouble with arbitrum Goerli right now?
undefined says Could you share your issue here?
undefined says Yes! Basically i cant deploy, because it throws a gas error
undefined says This is remix.

I also tried with hardhat, but got an error again. with mumbai all worked like a charm.

I think the gas estimation is off, and i dont know what to put in to make it work.

I had 0.075 Goerli Arbitrum ETH to try to deploy
undefined says You need to use eth_call to via RPC to get the estimation. On the eth_call put to address as the node interface address
undefined says It works fine! May I ask what’s the issue?
undefined says Me too
undefined says This amount isn’t enough for deploying on Arb Goerli rn.
If you check Goerli, the gas price is around 7000 gwei.
Also note that in Arbitrum, transaction fee is 2-D. You need to pay some fee for L1 (here Goerli) to send batches of L2 transactions back to L1
So because base fee on Goerli is so high, transactions on Arb goerli is more expensive than usual
That’s why you need more goerli ETH on your pocket.
undefined says Also you can read more about 2D gas here https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says I get the same for my normally working contracts atm its because of the high gas fees.
undefined says also a standard transaction on arb goerli estimates to 0.15 eth fees
undefined says Thank you guys. How much would ROUGHLY be required? Is this often an issue, so can i wait an hope its gonna get resolved
undefined says as I understand, your balance does not matter. You can see my balance is 1.8 goerliETH. The error says "gas required exceed allowance".
undefined says Ahhh i see. So it seems its impossible to deploy properly right now, due to arbitrum main and testnet having issues?
undefined says not arbitrum is the problem here but the underlaying network. For me it looks like on mainnet everything is fine, the goerli network is the problem here.
undefined says Ah i see. I had the same error on mainnet, but had a lot less tokens there.
That could have been my bad.

Rinkedby is depracted right? so no testing für arbitrum rn`?
undefined says not sure about mainnet but it looks fine, a standard transaction is $0.4.
yes rinkeby is deprecated
undefined says Thank you. You've been a great help
undefined says that's true, you can also get that same error for insufficient balance
undefined says Yeah that was prolly it then
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I have submitted the vulnerability report long days ago and no response yet, Kindly take a look and let me know an progress please
undefined says Can you please share your tx with me, so I can test it?
undefined says Have you submitted it on Immunefi? If yes can you send me your submission number?
undefined says I got his error 

err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory" when I want to run my node. 

I use the command :docker run --network host --rm -it  -v /home/user/.arbitrum  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url <my-l1-RPC> --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*

My nitro.tar file location is user/.arbitrum/arb1/nitro/nitro.tar

Can someone help me pls?
undefined says err="no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"
undefined says See if you can find "arb1" folder, empty this folder and extract the archive there
undefined says done but I still get the same error
should I add --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar" like on the docs ?
undefined says same error too, it's happening on all the nodes i am creating since 1 week
undefined says gas prices on nova seem extremely cheap, how is this the case? and how do I compare it to ONE
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs  No, I haven't reported it on Immunefi, report was DM'd to @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Is there any reason why Arbitrum Goerli has slowed down?
undefined says @ApeCoiner HV #290 I got this error when I deploy contracts on  Arbitrum-Goerli, How to fix it?
cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit
undefined says Can I build Abitrum Sequencer on my localhost?
undefined says This is because the da store place is different, you can see it here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node
undefined says Sorry, I don’t receive the dm, where did you send?
undefined says Thanks a lot
undefined says Could you send me the directions structure within your arb1 folder?
undefined says did you manage to get past this?
undefined says ty!!!
undefined says am in same boat

what `gas` settings is everyone else using at the moment with `hardhat` when deploying to `arbitrum goerli` ?
undefined says this is my hardhat config, but it don't work
undefined says its long back sent you
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs can you please check once
undefined says Do you get it resolved @Mr.Lance
undefined says Works
undefined says And here is the config for verify contracts on Arbitrum-Goerli.
I hope it‘s helpful
undefined says I got nothing in this file except nitro.tar
undefined says Oh, you need extract/decompress it.
undefined says I didn't see it in our chat box, you can submit it in Immunefi, there will be our colleagues who are dedicated to this aspect to deal with it, thanks!
undefined says mb 😅
I got now in arb1 file -> 
nitro.tar
nitro -> arbitrum-data
          ->classic-mg
          ->jwtsecret
          ->l2chaindata
          ->LOCK
          ->nitro.log
          ->nodekey
          ->triecache
undefined says yeah there is a game that is consuming all gas
undefined says Ok, you can now mount the dir that arb1 exists (yourPath/arb1, mount as yourPth: /home/user/.arbitrum)
undefined says Okkkk thanks!

I got this now, it means that all is good ?
undefined says and how do I know which port my node is running on?
undefined says hey is there a list of validators?
undefined says docker ps tell me port 8547 and 8548 but I can't access to this
undefined says Thanks man, saved my day!
undefined says admin，what is the $eth contract  on arbitrum goerli ?
undefined says Anyone know why im getting "invalid API key" when verifying on Goerli Arbitrum?
On mumbai everything works well with the same API Key
undefined says Need a different API key, can’t use same key across:
- arbitrum (and thus arb goerli)
- optimism (and thus op goerli)
- polygon (and thus mumbai)
undefined says Huh i see. Interessting. Where do i best fetch one?
undefined says Thank you for sharing your config!! 🙏🙏
undefined says You register on the etherscans for arbiscan, then you use same key for arb goerli verify - takes few minutes before key works on goerli arbiscan as well
undefined says I have one last question: How do i put in the apikey to the corresponding network?

My current way is not working:

    etherscan: {
      apiKey: {
          realmatic: '',
          mumbai: '',
          arbitrum: '',
          arbitrumtestnet: '',
      },
    customChains: [
        {
          network: "arbitrumtestnet",
          chainId: 421613,
          urls: {
            apiURL: "https://api-goerli.arbiscan.io/api",
            browserURL: "https://testnet.arbiscan.io/"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
undefined says With HH, right?
undefined says Yes. I deleted the api keys out of the '' so they are not public. But yes with hh
undefined says Let me grab my config for you…
undefined says Appreciate it! We can also private message if thats more convinient :)
undefined says Np, here is fine 😄
undefined says this is how mine looks, and works
undefined says That works! Thank you so much. safed me lots of pain again. Hit me up if you ever need anything lol, im gratefull
undefined says Awesome!! Glad it helped! 👍😄
undefined says I can't reply to this..
undefined says whatever bot is in here isn't letting me say things relating to this for some reason
undefined says I'll try to answer your question if you could send it again.
undefined says Basically I'm sending trxs that should succeed, it's definitely not something simple like an approval and when I send again a minute or so later with the same params it works.

We thought it might be due to the dramatic increase in base fee, but I can't find any metrics to support that theory. When I send with ethersjs default gas calculation options the trx will fail at the API level with `code UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT reason cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit`. I have not tried a manual gas limit, perhaps this will help, but when I used the code provided for calculating L1/L2/gasLimit and submit with that the trx just reverts with no error.

I've also tried a retry loop to retry the trx 10 times 1s interval but that never has worked so far. Unsure what the issue is.
undefined says Which chain are you sending txs on? ArbGoerli or Arb1?
undefined says i tried `./test-node.bash --init` why error `errno: -3008, code: 'ENOTFOUND', syscall: 'getaddrinfo', hostname: 'sequencer' }`  i kill all node using `ps -ef | grep node` and kill
and i tried reboot sometime but still error
undefined says about https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node#1-install
undefined says regular arbitrum
undefined says What comes to mind is our base price fluctuates fast. Your node might have some delays on this and when your tx relayed to sequencer, the price has already increased and your tx will not be included. That’s why you should not be setting the gas price as a fixed value. Instead, you need to call `eth_gasPrcie` each time to get the latest gas price.
undefined says I tried with a manual gas limit and that failed too.
undefined says I'm doing what's recommended in the docshttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/gas-estimation/scripts/exec.ts

```
  unsignedTx.maxPriorityFeePerGas = BigNumber.from("0");
  unsignedTx.gasLimit = G;
  unsignedTx.maxFeePerGas = P.mul(10);
```

And the trx just fails without error.
undefined says Should I just raise the base?
undefined says Yeah might help your tx go through if you add some buffer to the amount that's  returned by  `eth_gasPrcie` (ie raise the base)
undefined says How do I raise the base if it's set by the chain?
undefined says You need to set the gas price to be higher than the network base price, then the tx will go through.
Please take a close look at this document:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
It explains the process of estimating the gas very well.
undefined says This is exactly what I'm doing and sometimes trxs still fail. Probably 1/5 fail.
undefined says I see, can you share something reproducible so that we could take a closer look into the issue?
undefined says Should I be doing the top or the bottom?

```
  if (eip1559Version) {
    console.log("using eip1559 version");
    unsignedTx.maxPriorityFeePerGas = BigNumber.from("0");
    unsignedTx.maxFeePerGas = P.mul(10);
  } else {
    console.log("using pre-eip1559 version");
    unsignedTx.gasPrice = P;
  }
```
undefined says anyone know how to fix this error when verifying on arbiscan? " Error! Unable to generate Contract ByteCode and ABI
 Found the following ContractName(s) in source code : Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata, Ownable, SafeMath, Token"
undefined says What doesn't make sense is that even if it is a gas spike thing I don't understand why if I retry over 10 times and 10s one of them doesn't go through.
undefined says What repo should I post the issue to?
undefined says Willing to pay someone to help fix this error, just paid someone 200 and got scammed
undefined says I can't really reproduce the error with what you have provided. Another thing you could try is to estimate different gas components using `gasEstimateComponents` `gasEstimateL1Component`  methods of our NodeInterface:
https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/gas#nodeinterfacesol
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol 

I hope this helps!
undefined says Yeah it was a bug in my code.. Thanks for the help.
undefined says Was a bug relating to web3.py signatures.. updated my stack post https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/145514/web3-py-signing-message/145656#145656

Basically I was trying to handle the different trx types 1b/1c and was recreating the signature so when it went to erecover it failed without any error.. That was a fun one.
undefined says Np. Glad it's resolved!
undefined says issues verifying my contract on arbiscan
undefined says Hey have you tried this?
https://arbiscan.io/verifyContract
undefined says yes, getting this error
undefined says verify a token
undefined says Thx.
like decode the ABI? what secret in particular
undefined says What errors does it return?
undefined says UP_FLAG is none `https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/test-node.bash` because Error sequencer   errno: -3008, code: 'ENOTFOUND', syscall:'getaddrinfo', hostname: 'sequencer'}
ERROR: 1
I tried `killall node` but still error
undefined says Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND sequencer
undefined says what is the command you used to run that bash file and did you make any modification to the repo?
undefined says im not modification repo, i used `./test-node.bash --init` command
undefined says can you show me the output of `docker-compose ps`
undefined says 
undefined says `/usr/local/bin/nitro` is not exist. is that build problem ?
undefined says What's the output of `docker logs nitro_sequencer_1` ?
undefined says 
undefined says In `test-node.bash` line 5 try changing it to:
```
NITRO_NODE_VERSION=offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834-dev
```
undefined says then stop the existing instance and rerun `./test-node.bash --init`
undefined says We've merged the above fix so you should be able to just `git pull` and stop the existing instance, and then run `./test-node.bash --init` again
undefined says Launching sequencer.. Thanks a lot. I'm working on it, but it's taking forever.
it works very well. is there only NITRO_NODE_VERSION problem ?
undefined says lol. staker transaction is take that long? about 30 min ?
undefined says that's probably just the default interval to make new assertions at
undefined says thanks
undefined says Got CORS issue when send query to your API
undefined says `http://arbitrum.foundation/_next/data/VWLNq01bj-AZOQfr4qoiL/eligibility.json?address=${address}`
undefined says So if I use web3.js, is this the right call?

const callData = nodeInterface.methods.estimateRetryableTicket(
    sender,
    1ether,
     to,
     value,
     refund address,
     refund address,
     data
).encodeAbi();

const estimateGas = await web3.eth.call({
   jsonrpc: '2.0',
   method: 'eth_estimateGas',
   params: [
       {
               from: [senderAddress]
               to: 0xc8 address
               data: 
       }
   ]
})
undefined says I still get execution reverted.

or should I use web3.eth.estimateGas({
   to: 0xc8,
    data: callData
})
undefined says Does running watchtower by default will slow down the node?
undefined says Yes, should be this one
undefined says WatchTower won’t take up so much resources.
undefined says but will be faster if it disabled?
undefined says Do you mind sharing the addresses of these arbitrage bots?
undefined says Okay, Ty!
undefined says Hey guys, I want to bridge an ERC20 token from a gnosis safe to another address in Arbitrum
undefined says ok, was asking here as this might involve calling the contracts directly than user support
undefined says @MOD
undefined says Did you ever get a good answer to this? I wonder if it's just a load problem. I've had txs go through by just waiting a few minutes.
undefined says 0x0aacc6124269f9591a5fcb33d34654918c151221

There’s one and if you check the blocks this one has a tx in you will find many more as they are competing for the same arbs
undefined says I have run a feed relay from this link https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-feed-relay

and I tried to read the sequencer feed https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed but I didn't get any message from the websocket. The websocket is connected (my nodejs script say it is), but I have run it for like 30 minutes but didn't get any message. Is there an example of script/code to listen to the local feed relay ?
undefined says Do you guys know who is running sequencer for Arbitrum?
undefined says (ARB)ETH is usage for gas fee on Arbitrum chain and there is no consensus algorithm in Arbitrum chain, then what is the usage of ARB token? 
At first, I thought that the sequencer would receive ARB for rollup work, but it seems that it is not so, so I ask a question.
undefined says There are many documents about the Arbitrum chain, but I am curious about the usage of the ARB token in the Arbitrum chain.
undefined says when I check the timestamp field on the sequencer feed its about 6 minutes ahead of my timestamp when I receive the message. 

I've just synced ntp locally so pretty happy my time is correct

I read in the comments the timestamp s the sequencers local timstamp - why is it so far off please ? 

6 minutes is a lot
undefined says Wow that account makes a lot of transactions.. I also found 0xDAE6dd9AD7093EC747fBBA15e2592BaC9f12b881 which seems very active
undefined says Cool
undefined says There are some some third party bridges built in Gnosis Safe as a Safe App => https://app.safe.global/apps
I have only tried Hop and it looks like it allows bridging erc20 tokens to a different address in Arbitrum. There are other 3rd party bridges too, in case you want to try another one.
undefined says Is your L2 node fully synced? And what command are you using to run it?
undefined says $ARB token is a governance token => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/arb-token
undefined says How are you connecting to the feed? What command are you using?
undefined says just changed my provider endpoint
undefined says Trying to learn about Arbitrum
undefined says If I run this to check the sync status I get ```missing token```

`curl -X POST \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8549' \
  --header 'Accept: */*' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"eth_syncing"}'`
undefined says By default your node should be running on port `8547`, instead of `8549`. Did you change the default port?
undefined says I am so dumb...
undefined says No worries, it happens to all of us 😅
undefined says connecting to the sequencer :

```websocat - log:timestamp:"ws://<URL>/feed"    ```
undefined says Does it happen only when you use that library? 
(I get correct timestamps from Arb1's Sequencer when I connect to it using ws)
undefined says really ? its the data inside the message - id be pretty surprised if it was the library somehow changing the timestamp in the feed - I mean its just json (with binary fields)
undefined says hmm... just ran it again and its up to date
undefined says What network are you reading the feed from? Just to make sure everything's fine.
undefined says wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed from europe. I had two feeds running at the same time recording to log file, and both displayed the same issue - timestamps from 6 minutes ago
undefined says let me ask one last thing. I am listening to events using websocket.
To send a tx is better to use websocket or http transport?
The aim is to send it the fastest way possible. I don't care if it will fail etc
undefined says L2 is fully synced, but does the L2 doesn't have anything to do with the feed relay ? I just want to read the sequencer feed ..
I run feed relay with this command `docker run --rm -it  -p 0.0.0.0:9642:9642 --entrypoint relay offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --node.feed.output.addr=0.0.0.0 --node.feed.input.url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed --l2.chain-id=42161`
and use my nodejs script to connect to the sequencer feed to this ws url `ws://172.17.0.1:9642` , `172.17.0.1` is my machine local IP
undefined says Sorry, I misread your original question. Your command looks fine. Can you test the relayed feed from the same machine you're running the relayer from? I've tested multiple times today and everything seems to work OK, so it might be an issue in your local network.
(i.e., connect to `ws://localhost:9642` from the same machine first. Then you can verify with another machine in the same network.)
undefined says This isn't configured to support direct queries by design
undefined says I'm trying to send all of by balance to DApp using ethers. Idea is:
1) estimage gas
2) multiply by gasprice (0.1gwei)
3) subtract this from my balance, and the remainder could be sent.

This is the final bits:
undefined says and this is what I have in my console:

Any ideas what am I doing wrong?
undefined says Got it. I need to multiply on MaxFeePerGas, not to gasPrice. The power of open source
undefined says Any devs here that can assist me on technical questions?
undefined says It says that we can build a custom bridge between an already deployed L1 token with a customized token on Arbitrum. But, itt seems like we have to conform to ICustomToken interface on L1. Can i know the directions to build a custom gateway if I want to use an ERC20 already deployed on the Ethereum (meaning, without using ICustomToken interface)
undefined says Yes, it is possible to bridge a customized token in Layer 2 (L2) with an ERC20 token already deployed on Ethereum without using the ICustomToken interface.
undefined says To achieve this, you will need to create a custom gateway contract that interacts with the ERC20 token on Ethereum and the customized token on the L2 network. The gateway contract acts as a bridge between the two networks, allowing tokens to be transferred between them.
undefined says Thanks! Can i be directed to a doc where I can implement this? I am currently looking at "Token Bridge" in Arbitrum Docs
undefined says If your l1 token is not upgradeable, you might do the following things: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14-r35L7kOtEzmHlQGblhhM52jsjv6lrW_VXOzmY1mWM/edit
undefined says Does this mean 
1. L1 token should follow the ICustombridge interface for developers to bridge tokens using custom gateway?
2. If our L1 token isn't upgradeable - not able to implement the interface - we should register our token in Offcahin Labs?
undefined says Yes, you need prove that token is deployed by you or you are the admin of that token, if we don’t do this, anyone can hack the token on l2 directly, that would be very dangerous.
undefined says Arbitrum Classic node takes 10 hours to bootstrap. Reads disk at 10KB/s by 1.5IOPS, 0.5ms latency. Can it be made faster?
undefined says Thanks for your help! Just few more questions. 
1. Before submitting registration, we should deploy our customized L2 tokens on arbitrum first. 
2. After registering our tokens at the Registry, the L1 and L2 tokens are mapped and we can use customgateway contracts to bridge across the tokens?
undefined says Thanks, where can we register?
1. So, deploy customized l2 token and once l1 and l2 tokens are mapped, we can use our custom gateway contracts?
undefined says Have your project launched? If so, you can contact our partnerships team via partnerships@offchainlabs.com, then I will tell you the next steps of this in our chat group.
undefined says We have launched our project few years ago and are planning to implement Arbitrum. Before contacting partnerships, we hope to test if our intended functions work with the methods you described above. 
1. Do you provide mapping in Goerli for testing? For instance, mapping our deployed erc20 dummy token (with no ICustomToken interface) and our customized token in L2 in Registry to test our custom bridge implementation?
undefined says I don’t think we have this test on goerli, but will check that and revert to you.
undefined says Looking forward to it. Thanks!
undefined says May I know the road map for Arbitrum one, for 2023 and next years.
undefined says We will upgrade to stylus at the end of this year: https://offchain.medium.com/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22 , which will support evm+ and you can have a faster onchain computation.
undefined says Can we see any upgrades to lower the gas fees on Arbitrum One in this 2023 ? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says The stylus will also reduce the cost if use the rust or other evm+ contract, also, eip4844 launch will also reduce the cost.
undefined says Got it Thank you
undefined says Of course, it’s fully automated and they’re probably following 100s of tokens for potential profits
undefined says error: ProviderError: insufficient funds have 1000000000000000 want 245388612960539178    Oh got its asking 429 usdt to deploy nft contract on arbitrum testnet
undefined says Guys.. I have one question please.. How long it will take for my Arbitrum transaction to be sent to Ethereum chain? I want to build the smart contract using Arbitrum, because Ethereum gas fees are too high, and also want to access this contract later using Ethereum chain. Thank you very much for your help.
undefined says i have an issue on my node:

```May 12 14:03:37 Ubuntu-2004-focal-64-minimal bash[675]: WARN [05-12|14:03:37.664] failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429"```
undefined says any idea why ?
Version: v2.0.13-174496c
undefined says 
undefined says 429 is a rate limit
undefined says yes. but i didn't even use the RPC node , it's just syncing. why would i have a rate limit ? @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st
undefined says dunno. something on your end is hitting the arbitrum feed faster than they want.
undefined says Not exactly $429 (GoerliETH is worth around $0.10), but 0.245 GoETH is still expensive, yes. Goerli is a bit congested these days.
undefined says But when I convert this to usd 245388612960539178 i got 429$
undefined says There are two ways to communicate cross chain:
- From L1 to L2 (takes around 15-20 minutes from the moment the transaction is submitted on L1 to the moment it is executed on L2) => https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging
- From L2 to L1 (takes a full challenge period, 7 days, to be executable on L1) => https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging

Depending on your use case, you can use one or the other. Or use Oracles for a less decentralized but more immediate interaction. If you tell us more about what you're trying to build we might be able to help you better.
undefined says If you're using Goerli, you're using GoerliETH which now has a different $ value => 0.245 ETH = ~$0.0245
When you deploy on mainnet, you will probably pay less ETH but more $, because mainnet is less congested but ETH is more expensive.
undefined says I suggest you use the latest image available `offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834` 
If the problem persists, please use this Troubleshooting guide and send the final report on #🏃︱noderunning  => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says Ohh got it 👍
undefined says Why does it taking eth value instead of Goeth value
undefined says Is there somewhere an example how to send L2 to L1 transaction (or message). I want to send a contract deployment transaction from Arbitrum to Ethereum, I know how to create that transaction, but I'm not sure where and how to send it. Is this also supported with the Oracles? Thank you very much for your help.
undefined says Are there some examples please?
undefined says Sorry, I was looking for some official example from the website or similar
undefined says Hey everyone! Looking into bridges and super curious on what is a safe way to store the private keys. Any solutions that come to mind?

undefined says The amount of time it takes to set up a development environment for the first time can vary depending on various factors such as your familiarity with the tools and technologies involved, the complexity of the environment, the resources available, and any unforeseen issues that may arise.
undefined says Hey guys!

Whats address for ARB on Arbitrum Goerli?
And whats WETH on Arbitrum Goerli? 

Much appreciated
undefined says @DOMINIC.NP
undefined says We have sent an inquiry in partnerships@offchainlabs.com. May we know when we can expect to hear it back? Thanks
undefined says I have created a retryable contract from goerli L1 to goerli abitrum at this transaction my ticket ID is: 371326

https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xe190fe9d4d1dbae571481f8b2c1520ef3e48ac564abca606f5fbe5f5c3de1ed

Now here is the L2 transaction which is passing

https://goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0xaff2718917243d96666a84117d8c90f7aa2a04cdcee4294450be5f56a80cfec6

I don't know exactly why the L2 tx is splitted in two but here is the second one interacting with the contract specified in the ticket but it fails because run out of gas

https://goerli.arbiscan.io/tx/0xeea52d009ecfd50c1df355eb4f86ca11322ad214dc5d6b3cd042e5137a3948a7

How can I redeem the ticket because it isn't anymore in the ArbRetryableTx ? (it was 1h ago)

So my questions are why the transaction on L2 is splitted in 2 and why even if the tx failed I can't redeem ?
undefined says how do i find a list of all running public rpc nodes / sequencers
undefined says When your auto redeem failed, you can redeem it again via https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/tx/0xe190fe9d4d1dbae571481f8b2c1520ef3e48ac564abca606f5fbe5f5c3de1edf , but it will expire in 7 days if you don’t redeem it successfully.
undefined says No, it is a part of the bridge, you can see it here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#canonical-token-bridge-implementation
undefined says Weth address you can find here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses , arb token address: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says You can use our sdk directly: https://developer.arbitrum.io/sdk/modules/message_L2ToL1Message
undefined says Is there any way to build our own blockchain environment like Optimism instead of getting the Arbitrum blockchain development environment as a clone?
undefined says We have orbit which you can customize your configure when setting up the chains: https://arbitrum.foundation/orbit , but it still under development.
undefined says Anyone know who runs the sequencer for Arbitrum?
undefined says I tried to do it directly from etherscan but always failed
undefined says And if the tx failed for something else than gas. Is it possible for the l1 contract to know it ?
undefined says No, you need query it via l2
undefined says is there a uniswap v2 for arbitrum one?
undefined says the sequencer normally responds with transaction success/failure within 1-2 seconds. Why does it sometimes take 5s please ? could it be something on our side, or is it potentially just load on the sequencer
undefined says where to buy goerli arb ?
undefined says Hey!
I'm deploying a new protocol on Arbitrum, and I was wondering if there is any grants program to support us. Does anyone know about that?
undefined says It's normal that sometimes txs take longer time due to congestion. Our sequencer has a first-come first-sever rule for ordering txs and keep txs on a queue. So in congestion events, it may take longer for your tx to get through.
But in some cases it may be network delays as well
undefined says gm! am i right that L2=>L1 messaging has a 1 week delay?
undefined says It's related to Arbitrum Foundation, not Offchain labs. Please take a look at their Forum here and ask your questions there:
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/
undefined says Yeah that's correct. This is the challenge period delay, and provide some time to challenge the blocks produced by validators if they're wrong
undefined says Not that L1=>L2 messages takes ~15 mins cause we don't need such a delay on L1 to L2 side
undefined says Are there any news on the time boost proposal? No activity in months, seems dead?
undefined says I was looking for the contract address of the ARB token in the rinkeby test net, can someone give me a hand?
undefined says how is it possible that someone place the tx always at first index of the block
undefined says We are not active in Rinkeby anymore. Just Goerli. Also on goerli we don’t have ARB token. For testings you can use any general ERC20 there
undefined says The first transaction on L2 blocks, are special transactions that just updates internal parameters such as timstamp etc. it’s not a grneral transaction
undefined says How do I estimates cost from Goerli to mainnet
undefined says If I try to run this command to run a node: 
`docker run --rm -it  -v /some/local/dir/arbitrum-mainnet/:/home/user/.arbitrum/mainnet -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4 --l1.url=https://l1-node:8545 --node.chain-id=42161 --l2.disable-upstream` 
It gives me this error the whole time: 
`{"level":"warn","component":"configuration","error":"Post \"https://l1-node:8545\": dial tcp: lookup l1-node on 161.97.189.52:53: no such host","time":"2023-05-15T21:40:36Z","caller":"/home/user/arb-util/configuration/configuration.go:691","message":"Error getting chain ID"} `
is that normal?
undefined says Is your l1 node running at 161.97.189.52:53? Can you send rpc request to it within the container and it can serve successfully?
undefined says You need use eth_estimateGas directly to the target chain you want to estimate.
undefined says Hello!
Could you tell me how to make address aliasing test code in hardhat?

When trying to test with Hardhat, I need to generate an aliased address, but it seems nearly impossible to do so. I'm unsure how to create a msg.sender that is equivalent to AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(counterpartGateway).

```
    modifier onlyCounterpartGateway() override {
        require(
            msg.sender == AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(counterpartGateway),
            "ONLY_COUNTERPART_GATEWAY"
        );
        _;
    }
```

from the instructions
undefined says Does anyone deployed ERC20 token on arbitrum fisrt then deploy on L1 to be bridged (vise-versa)? 
I saw the doc (https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway) but don't really get it how to.
The token is typical one like:
```solidity
contract Token is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, Ownable, ERC20Permit {
    // ...
}
```

Appreciated for any help/adivce!
undefined says I see, Do you change the l1-node string to your l1 node IP address? If so, can you send the rpc request to that IP address and return successfully?
undefined says So you mean you deploy the token both on l1 and l2 right? If so, you can see this tutorial: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging , this will tell you what your contract need to implement (ICustomToken like)
undefined says We don’t have a fixed block time as l1, so the block number counts in one year will be different due to the network status.
undefined says well no, that is a normal tx, the only difference use that it is type Legacy
undefined says Hi, are you testing cross layer messages? If so, you might need to see this docs: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging. Or if you want to bridge your token, we have tutorial here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials. When you send a unsigned tx from l1, your sender address will be aliased, but you can send a signed tx on l1, it will not get alias: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg, about the alias library: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/67127e2c2fd0943d9d87a05915d77b1f220906aa/src/libraries/AddressAliasHelper.sol
undefined says We use first come first serve model, it depends on your tx’s sequence when arrive the sequencer, we currently don’t have priority fee things to let your tx get included faster.
undefined says Yes I know this, but it is impossible that that user always arrives as first index in the block
undefined says it always arrives at index 1. the only difference that i see is the tx type that is Legacy (not eip1559). If you want to check a tx I can send in private
undefined says Who gets transaction fees on arbitrum? Are fees paid to the validators (miners)?
undefined says what determines how many transactions go into a block, and what determines how long a block takes please ? 

for example some blocks have say 48 txn, and some blocks only have 5. Obviously there is some aspect of how many txn are submitted during any time period, but would like to understand better how its managed pls

thanks!
undefined says Thanks for the answer! I actually have two different cases (two different tokens and not related each other, separate project)

Token 1) I deployed a Token on Arbitrum and want users to bridge to L1 (eg. Eth)

Token 2) I deployed another Token on Ethereum and want that token to be used on arbitrum chain

If i look at docs, it seems like the token must implement either ICustomToken or IArbToken, if my tokens are already deployed without implementing those, then its not possible to be listed on arbitrum bridge UI?
undefined says Is this the correct address of USDC on arbitrum testnet `0xFF970A61A04b1cA14834A43f5dE4533eBDDB5CC8`? I minted and transfered tokens succefully but i cant read my balance or any other view function
undefined says no
undefined says `web3.exceptions.BadFunctionCallOutput: Could not transact with/call contract function, is contract deployed correctly and chain synced?`
this is the error i get when trying to call a view function , i can interact with the public function
undefined says Does Arbitrum implement EIP-1559?
undefined says yes
undefined says 
undefined says are you talking about 0x4b27...?
undefined says wtf how do you know ahah
undefined says No. Revenues are used first to compensate what the BatchPoster (sequencer) has spent on L1, and the surplus goes to the DAO treasury.
undefined says There is a 32 million gas limit on Arb blocks and that indicates how many transactions will go into a block. We typically don't get that much congestion in the network where more than a few million gas is needed in a block, since we print up to 4 blocks per second.
undefined says If yourL1 token does not conform to the ICustomToken interface (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/ICustomToken.sol)  (it doesn't have isArbitrumEnabled, `registerTokenOnL2`) and is not upgradeable, you can’t use our use the Generic Custom Gateway and you will require a special gateway. Setting up a special gateway can be tricky! One example that could help you is DAI: (L1 gateway: https://etherscan.io/address/0xD3B5b60020504bc3489D6949d545893982BA3011#code and L2: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x467194771dAe2967Aef3ECbEDD3Bf9a310C76C65#code)
undefined says I don't think that's the correct address for USDC. 
I think this is the right one: https://testnet.arbiscan.io/address/0xe14fe5ac9aa3a7774dd4505032c4531a0152ecb1

Unexpected output: `web3.eth.getBlockNumber().then(console.log)` the result of getBlockNumber is OK and exactly as same as from arbiscan, but when I execute `web3.eth.getBalance("0x6****2C3").then(console.log)` the result is zero, no matter what address I give. The node version is offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 and the RPC parameters are all set. It was normal when I connected to the public API `"https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc"`, so I guess something was wrong of my node.

undefined says Could you please send https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactioncount ? Maybe your node occurs sync issue you need resync it.

undefined says The txCount from my node is also 0, but it's non-zero from the public endpoint.

undefined says Good project
undefined says I'm studying/deploying and testing smart contracts on goerli arb. one thing that i've seemed to notice is that contract language that refers to the uniswap router specifically in contracts that can only be deployed on sushi (on arb) generally still seem to function w/out changing the contract language. is this because sushi was a clone of uni?
undefined says Hey, I'm working on adding the arbitrum bridge to Hyperlane.
undefined says I had a question regarding retryables. Can I cancel a retryable ticket from arbitrum's l1 contracts?
undefined says Their contract both can be deployed on evm, so it more depends on the code logic, you can see how the logic they implement.
undefined says It can’t, but it will expire in 1 week.
undefined says ahh ok, so can the l2 receiver call this? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/7f76d1d5b97b7c9484264c9d9c4bef6dc9c13e7a/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.go#L198
undefined says Does sequencer also receive L2 fees? Also, I have found on docs that priority fee is refunded but what other fees are collected as a a surplus?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/develop/src/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L56 ， the msg.sender should be the beneficiary address you set on l1.
undefined says ahh sick, thanks!
undefined says do u happen to have foundry tests for l2 bridge contracts?
undefined says also what security exploit is aliasing preventing (only applicable if contracts)?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  I dont know if you can see my reply.
undefined says To make this question more simpler, who gets network fee? Example down there 👇 

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xD423B4E40B1F11937269DDCEDF718171D5D5885CCBF6D5E9D170C7BFEB2B9BF3#txninfo
undefined says I see that in nitro there are several types of tx for a tx (1, 120 for legacy types, 2 for dynamic fee tx type and so on).

Are fees calculated with EIP-1559 for legacy tx types or only for tx type 2?
undefined says if I subscribe to new heads with this:

```let mut sub = web3s.eth_subscribe().subscribe_new_heads().await?;```

why is the block number from blockheader different to the sequencer feed blocknumber please ?
undefined says Could you point me where in the code is this hapenning?
undefined says How can we stake?
ARB token
undefined says no, a lot of the contract work on Nitro pre-dates Foundry, so the tests are all written in Hardhat, I believe.
undefined says For one, you can't be certain that the contract at an address on L1 and the contract at an address on L2 is the same code, since when using `CREATE` a contract address is determined by the deployer and the nonce. `CREATE2` offers a way to get around that, but there's no way to enforce the usage of `CREATE2` and even in that case, where a contract is carefully deployed to the same address on L1 and L2, there's a chance that the state or ownership of L1 and L2 contracts diverge. They could have different owners, for example. The alias also makes it clear that the message is coming from an L1 contract
undefined says the DAO gets all fees at this point
undefined says we accept the various types that exist on L1 for compatibility sake, but you can use either one. We don't have the same EIP-1559 mechanic so any tip or amount provided over the computed fee, is refunded. We do have our own algorithm that exponentially increases the L2 gas price if gas exceeds the "speed limit" for to long (currently 7M gas / sec): https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-speed-limit
undefined says that will return the L1 block number, not the L2 block number. To get the L2 block number, use: ` ArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber()` https://developer.arbitrum.io/time#arbitrum-block-numbers
undefined says there is no staking
undefined says Ahh i see, makes sense. Thanks a lot!
undefined says Is there something going on with remix or the agor rpc's? I have not been able to deploy today even with yesterday's gas limits that worked

undefined says How about changing to another rpc?
undefined says Thank you for your reply.

I have already created a contract on Arbitrum (L2) as shown below. Now, I would like to test the testCall() function using Hardhat. However, I'm unable to perform the test because it requires comparing the address with an alias inside the validateSender() function.

Is it possible to test this function using Hardhat?

```
contract ArbitrumChildCheckpointManager {
  address public L1Address;
  constructor (address _address) {
    L1Address = _address;
  }

  function testCall(bytes memory data) external onlyFromMyL1Contract(msg.sender) {
        // Test implementation
  }

  modifier validateSender(address _sender) {
      require(_sender == AddressAliasHelper.applyL1ToL2Alias(L1Address), "ONLY_COUNTERPART_CONTRACT");
      _;
  }
}
```
undefined says Hardhat currently doesn’t support local arbitrum cross layer test, but you can test on our goerli testnet, that is the easiest way.
undefined says Thank you, you rock 🪨
undefined says thanks for this answer - is there any way to subscribe to this from javascript/web3 client code pls ?
undefined says 
undefined says I was just warned for duplicate text when I havent sent duplicate text. Can someone tell me why the filters here are so wonky and can i post the snippet of code im having issues with on arb goerli without the filter wiping it?
undefined says 
undefined says arbitrum bot just banned my message again and I need HALP pls lol
undefined says 
undefined says Thank you for your support! I got it.
undefined says Can you send a screenshot of the code/message you want to send?
undefined says if I decode the l2Msg on the sequencer feed does it have the block number pls ?
undefined says ok sure thanks
undefined says 
undefined says It has the L1 block number, as you can see here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says It looks like something must be reverting in the contract you're calling (maybe not passing a "require"?)
undefined says yea, that's what i've been checking for but can't seem to find anything. for example when the contract is deployed on eth mainnet, and the function is called, it checks to see if the required pair (eth, token x) have been sent to the contract. If either token is missing it throws back this same error. However, on goerli arb, the pair was sent to the contract so i'm baffled as to why it's throwing the error. wondered if it was something with the way gas is processed on arb -- or frankly if it's just some weird issue with arb goerli and the same issue won't happen on arb proper
undefined says try using https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer to step through your transaction's execution and see where it errored exactly, assuming the contract's source is verified
undefined says ok thanks!
undefined says hmm, it says no source code for the contract even though the contract is verified. strange
undefined says I think they might have their own contract verification thing, you might have to verify it there
undefined says thx
undefined says used the simulator to rerun the tx , so it's giving me details now
undefined says Quick questions!
Does my ERC20 token contract that will be deployed on Arbitrum first needs to implement some interfaces like `IArbToken ` in the demo in order to be bridged to L1 with standardERC20 bridge? if so, (like the demo - https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/custom-token-bridging/contracts/L2Token.sol - shows) what address for _l2Gateway should I put? is it the one I must deploy for my own token?
undefined says I'm comparing Arbitrum Nova and Optimism Bedrock. Where can I find code specs for the Arbitrum stack (execution client, consensus, da spec to understand DAC and how they're generated etc...). I could find technical specs for Optimism (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/specs)

undefined says You have more information here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust

If you also want info on Nitro (Anytrust is a variant of Nitro), it is here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
undefined says Hey guys! Could you help me with the issue I am having with ARB node? This one - https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1644
undefined says Hey, I was trying to send a message from l2 to l1 through arbitrum native bridge but it is reverting at l1 with NoRollup error, simulated here:
https://dashboard.tenderly.co/ameesha/project/simulator/0e8b2131-1828-4c17-a216-730a0964b6a7

what can be wrong here?
undefined says you are attempting to run archival node? just out of curiosity , who much space do you project it will take? I am running full node and it is 1.5TB already
undefined says Yeah, we are running an archival node, but I am not sure how much space it takes, since my devs are the ones who take care of it👀
undefined says no you aren't , "missing trie" error means you don't have the state for antique block, so you are running a full node. Archival node on Main Net with 17 million blocks takes 14 TB of SSD storage, Arbitrum is now 92 million blocks, so it must be bigger than 14 TB, so I am asking. That must be very expensive
undefined says Maybe that's the case, because we definitely are trying to run the archival one and need it very much. Do you have any guide on how we can do that?
undefined says well there is a flag for that, `--node.caching.archive` , but if you are syncing from snapshot all the past states are probably pruned so you need to run from block 0 . Compile your own `nitro` binary from the sources and start it probably with `--init.empty` flag
undefined says to compile from sources download the master repo, then :
1. checkout into the commit which marks the release 2.0.14 (don't download the releases tarbal, it doesn't compile)
2. install rust & golang
3. update cbindgen package
4. run `git submodule update --recursive --init`
5. run `make build`
6 then, cd to `cmd/nitro` and run `go build .`

then you will be able to run with any parameters you wish or add your own stuff to the sources
undefined says Thank you so much! That will help us a lot, I will forward to my Devs. Have a wonderful day mate ❤️
undefined says hey so there's always more than one way to program something. . . 

I was looking at makerdao's cross-chain messaging library and the way they authenticate L2->L1 messages is something like...

 inbox.bridge().activeOutbox().l2tol1sender() == authenticatedSender

this is also how the custom token gateway tutorial does it  and how the arbitrum greeter tutorial does it

but the way open zeppelin implements authentication is

bridge.activeOutbox().l2tol1sender() == authenticatedSender

its just a subtle difference, but from a security stand point, probably we should use the bridge as the source of truth instead of the inbox? 

maybe it makes sense that a custom token gateway has an immutable inbox and uses that as a source of truth since the contract also sends messages through that inbox, but authenticated messages come from the bridge anyways. Is it just not that important whether we use an immutable inbox to get the bridge or just use an immutable value for the bridge to begin with if i don't use the inbox for any other methods to begin with?
undefined says Why is this claiming(bridge from arbitrum goerli -> goerli) too slow?
undefined says 
undefined says does arbitrum suppoet 1559?
undefined says $
undefined says How to i swap weth into eth programatically using a swap like camelot?
undefined says Basically i want to perform this action with code:
undefined says Do you know if arbitrum allows dApps to use "session keys"? I think this is what dYdX uses
undefined says Why can't we find that in the docs ?
Did I miss something ?
undefined says If you want to run archive node, you still need to set `init.url` to nitro genesis snapshot, and run classic archive node, we have a docs here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-an-archive-node , @nuliknol
undefined says We don’t have docs to compile the source code, but provide how to run docker image, if you want to compile, you need follow this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/Dockerfile
undefined says You need to have their abi, you can get this from arbiscan or their GitHub, then you can use ethersjs or others web3 libraries to call it.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says can anyone kindly tellme how to extract token holders from api?
undefined says Is there any StandardArbERC20 token listed on CMC?
undefined says You can query it using arbiscan api: https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/tokens#get-token-holder-list-by-contract-address
undefined says You can see if CMC has token in https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbitrum_token_token_list.json
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs can you help me with this please?
I was trying to send a message from l2 to l1 through arbitrum native bridge but it is reverting at l1 with NoRollup error, simulated here:
https://dashboard.tenderly.co/ameesha/project/simulator/0e8b2131-1828-4c17-a216-730a0964b6a7
undefined says Tenderly has some issues when simulate tx send to proxy upgradable tx, so your tx may not revert by that reason, you can send eth_estimateGas to the chain, and see if there is any errors reason report by contract.
undefined says outbox address change for each message or it remains constant?
undefined says We have 3 outboxes, but others 2 are used for the tx sent before 2022/8/31, so for now, it remains the same.
undefined says where can I find addresses for all outbox contracts? (latest)
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses
undefined says I’m sorry but I don’t get it. The json file only contains ARB token info, and can you clarify what it means by see if coin market cap has token in the json 🙏 please?
undefined says Are you there
undefined says How can I get a random number on Arbitrum? I were using block.timestamp + block.difficulty on Ethereum but I don't think they are still working on L2, I don't need to use an external oracle because I don't need to pay for it
undefined says hey guys is something going on on arbitrum goreli testnet?
undefined says it seems super expensive to make a transaction
undefined says 💙🧡** Today we have a Workshop with Chainlink!**

Hope to see you there! 
Is in ~2 hours! 

Who’s coming ? 🙂 
Let me know! To say hi in the comments💃 👋
undefined says https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1659632671289487360?s=20
undefined says We are liveeee
undefined says Oh, sorry, should be this one: https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_coinmarketcap.json , this is we get the l1 token info from cmc and get their related l2 token, you can use it to see if cmc record those l2 token info.
undefined says Neither block.number nor block.timestamp can’t give you random number, this is also same as ethereum, but you can use api3’s qrng to generate.
undefined says Getting Very High Gas Prices
undefined says Does this mean that you are working on implementing priority fee design to let some transactions get mined faster?
undefined says Has the issue been resolved @Aditya | DappLooker
undefined says Hey!
Can somebody help me?
There is a light mode of arbitrum node?
Thanks!
undefined says arb1.arbitrum.io down?
undefined says I'm having issues too
undefined says ye its down
undefined says So I guess that means the entire network is down too
undefined says it ll be fine stability has been great the last few months
undefined says we back
undefined says ```{'code': -32000, 'message': 'no backends available'}```
first time i m getting this error
and we dead again 😄
undefined says how often is a new Arbitrum nitro snapshot uploaded?
undefined says Is it solved? We has an issue on our public RPC, which is resolved
undefined says Yeah we’re thinking about it but not sure when will be rolled out
undefined says Currently we have just full nodes, but you can prune
undefined says It should be ok now
undefined says We don’t have a specific timeline for it now
undefined says yes all seems to be fine again for some time now thanks!
undefined says bh
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says my contract is immutable, what if the oracle stops working?
undefined says If you use oracle, you’d better use a function to write/set the oracle address. On chain random number should not use block.timestamp since it is dangerous.
undefined says where can i follow the latest news for Stylus or is there any docs out yet, pretty interested in that whole evm+ thing
undefined says is it dangerous even if the rewards for it are very low (less than 0.1 eth)? I mean they might spend more to mutate the random number
undefined says It depends on you, arbitrum timestamp updates will be more smoothly than ethereum, ethereum updates it every 12s, but arbitrum might be only 1s, which means attacker can much easier to find a timestamp to get the value they want.
undefined says You can see our research forum: https://research.arbitrum.io/
undefined says hi!

Wanted to ask about Arbitrum Retryables
undefined says on goerli eth and Arb goerli, is it normal that sending message cross L1 > L2 cost around 1.4 eth? It's weird because on L2 the actual fees is much lower and the ETH ended up being refunded in the L2 address
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says when subscribing to the websocket raw feed is there some king of ping / pong mechanism I could use to keep the connection alive ?
undefined says I might combine blockhash(block.number - 1), block.coinbase, block.gaslimit but can I get those values on arbitrum as well?
undefined says Why, in the develop branch, the ArbSys interface doesn't contain arbBlockHash() as specified in the docs ? Is this about to disappear ?

I'm very new to Arbitrum, sorry if it is a dumb question
undefined says I need some AETH in my wallet. I need goerli eth to bridge it to AETH, however the requirement for getting goerli eth is 0.001 eth on mainnet which i do not how. Can i get AETH for gas, need that on priority.
undefined says it's incredible that his transactions are always in the position 1 in blocks
undefined says @DAM - Chainlink VRF just launched on Arbitrum. Here is a workshop on how to use it: https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1659632671289487360?s=20
undefined says That's Arbitrum classic. Look at the nitro-contracts repo src/precompiles folder
undefined says thx 🙂
undefined says can anyone help with this?
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs  or anyone?
undefined says lmaooo no
undefined says Guys, can somebody say where can i learn about emergency withdrawal?
undefined says It’s easy to go about
undefined says I want to do one, but dont want to mess it up. Are there any additional tools, or MM is fine and when connecting to contract i didnt see "emergency withdraw" in specific, but seem like i should.
undefined says Hi!
Are there any ways to get all arbitrum classic block traces in a day or two?
Arbitrum classic node responds to trace block rpc from a few seconds up to a few minutes, I'have looked through the code and know the reason is using `C` lib in golang.
I changed the node source code, the node starts and the only thing it does is tracing the blocks, but even with that the speed is awful.
Below are the logs from 12 such `modified` instances of the arb-classic node:

undefined says @Not interested🤧  (Wont Dm First can you advise where to learn about emergency withdrawal?
undefined says @Not interested🤧  (Wont Dm First yes and i cant withdraw
undefined says @Not interested🤧  (Wont Dm First Im stakin ARB on multichain, and now site doesnt let to withdraw (no reaction from MM)
undefined says It could be possible that the multi-chain provider has disabled or restricted withdrawal of certain tokens. You may also need to make sure you have followed the necessary steps to withdrawal the tokens.
undefined says Their support says they have tech issues and it will be solved in near future, but i need it now
undefined says In order to withdraw your staked ARB, you will need to visit the Arb Protocol website and select 'Stake and Governance' in the main menu.
undefined says U mean the site . Foundation?
undefined says have you solved the issue with support?
undefined says I did not, and  man i dont feel safe even here
undefined says what's wrong?
undefined says @NepoDEFI devn you saw the issue in scam report
undefined says Actually the issue you are having is withdrawal right?
undefined says Yes and i need some info on how to perform emergency withdrawal
undefined says anyone??? @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says hey guys, where can i find the address of 'smart contract vesting wallet' which is mentioned in AIP 1.1 ?
undefined says You can, here is the description: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/gentle-introduction-run-node
undefined says Do you have the tx hash? What is the gas price at that time?
undefined says Checking
undefined says Where did you ge those address?
undefined says https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0xf6a02987ff42333a56e224dc75a0955e2b8895c1a7aa92160e1b1e34757e59af

undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs Can you check it?
undefined says Your auto-redeem failed, this is why it doesn’t credit back: https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/tx/0xb20e7a2e8aef16ec87708618c9c28ede695daa8cc7b4e78a04441c0814b65ab3
undefined says You can visit this website to redeem.
undefined says Will revert it to you when I get answers.
undefined says why does it fail tho? 

Also for the not failed ones it's the same

https://testnet.arbiscan.io/tx/0xf6a02987ff42333a56e224dc75a0955e2b8895c1a7aa92160e1b1e34757e59af

I had to deposit like 1.5 eth in Goerli only for Arb Goerli to use much lower of that gas and refund the rest to my wallet
undefined says I see the transaction will revert, did you set any check in your contract?
undefined says any thougths on this? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hey!
Classic node speeds are highly dependent on disk speed and latency, and RAM and CPU available. There's a closed issue in that repo that discusses several potentials options, but in general:
- Use NVMe drives, without RAID
- Ensure your nodes are not running out of RAM, and the CPU is not being used 100%
- One thing that does help is if you are walking the chain forward. As an example, if block 400 is already loaded in cache, then block 401 will load quickly because there is only a small difference that needs to be loaded from database.

You can see the full issue here => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-classic/issues/2546
undefined says I have a question regarding fees on Arbitrum. In this twitter thread, they state that the L2 fee is split in two components (min base fee + surplus base fee). https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1656090366179672066?s=20 What is the reason for this distinction? In the docs it says that tips are not used and the ordering is based on first-in-first-out (https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas#tips-in-l2)
undefined says Hey, we haven’t deployed yet, but we have pr here: https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/44
undefined says Thanks, but I don't have any problems with hardware, as I am using the server with 2 https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742 , 1TB RAM, and disk with over 800k IOPS https://semiconductor.samsung.com/ssd/enterprise-ssd/pm1725b/mzwll12thmla-00005/ ))
undefined says I’d like to get some assistance with ARB.
We keep running into this issue of missing trie node. Even after adding more RAM, the problem persists. Strangely enough, the public node is functioning fine, but ours isn't. Archived data functions smoothly, but when it comes to new contracts, this error just keeps popping up.
undefined says yo bro question does it happen to you as well where it requires to deposit ETH on L1 for gas and end up consumption on L2 is 1/10 of that and the rest got refunded?
undefined says What is arbitrum's one mainnet coinbase address? is it A4B000000000000000000073657175656E636572 ?
undefined says IIRC it depends if the message was sequenced directly by the sequencer or it's a delayed message coming from L1
undefined says Where could I find list of addresses? I just want to validate some data
undefined says I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but i like to know how i can add a bot in my own Discord server, like the L2 Gas Tracker? i cant find one in a search on google

undefined says anyone please ?
undefined says Are you connecting to a local feed relay? => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-feed-relay
undefined says no I am directly connecting to the ws feed in nodejs
undefined says Mmm, how often does the connection drop? (i.e., how much time is it kept alive)

(Also, if you're building something, keep in mind that feed endpoints will soon require compression with a custom dictionary, so it is suggested to run a local relay, which won't be compressed)
undefined says deconnections look quite random, that's why I was aksing if sending any kind of ping frames would help ? Not sure if this is implemented on the feed's side
undefined says I think it shouldn't be necessary, but I'll take a look. Could something in your configuration be cutting the connection?
undefined says Also, do you get any messages logged when the connection drops?
undefined says TOP
undefined says Guys, @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, @José FP | Offchain Labs👋🏻
Can anyone help us out here, please?
undefined says It looks like your node is not an archive node (the block you're asking for is old)
undefined says Can you share with me the nessesary flags or actions that we need to use, so we could get all the data for an archival node? Because we have synced it with different parameters and still, the node doesn't have all the data needed
undefined says Have you tried with this guide?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-an-archive-node

Also, keep in mind that you should set the archive flag from the first block. The node will not keep the data of the blocks that has already synced without the archive flag.
undefined says I will ask from my devs, but I believe that we have tried a lot of guides and ways to do so
undefined says We tried to use this instruction and we tried to download the snapshot "classic" and sync from zero
undefined says I wanted to send usdc to my another wallet address but I missed and mistakenly I send it to avalanche usdc contract address, is there any chance I can receive back my usdc?
undefined says Yea
undefined says i tried swapping/bridging tokens to arb goerli and it was succes as per the transaction but i didn't receive it. is there any issue?
undefined says Verify that you used the correct wallet address, the transaction was successfully confirmed
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs @Matt | Offchain Labs
undefined says Yuhuuu
undefined says @davidb | Offchain Labs
undefined says Do anytrust chains have trust minimized IBC like cosmos?
undefined says What is the current state of affairs with L3 chain bridging? Thanks
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @José FP | Offchain Labs 
It looks like we did everything as unstructured, but it didn’t work out. Any thoughts on how we can fix this problem?
undefined says I want to withdraw tokens from my solidity smart contract to my wallet. I have to do this for the native token:
‚owner.transfer(amount)‘
and this for other ERC20 tokens:
‚token.transfer(owner, amount)‘
What is the native token? Is it arb or weth? I thought arb, but gas is paid in weth…
undefined says Has your issue been resolved?
undefined says if this means eth is the native token, then yes
undefined says If you want to specific a number which is older 128 blocks than the latest block, you need run an archive node
undefined says No, the block number you specific is 46960809, you should just run nitro archive node, and you should sync from nitro genesis snapshot rather than 0. (If you want to sync from 0, you should run both classic archive node and nitro archive node)
undefined says Arbitrum native token is eth, not arb or weth.
undefined says You can see your l1 to l2 msg status here: https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/
undefined says If you send USDC to an address you don’t have the private key, you might lose that forever. You can contact USDC team to see if they can control that address and have recover function or not.
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#bridging-erc20-tokens
undefined says I tried to do a transaction with my own node.js project. But that gives me an error and I it says: `...maxFeePerGas: 361861500 baseFee: 525640000...` -> For sure, that cannot work...
But I am not even setting `maxFeePerGas` for my transaction. I am doing:
`const tx = await my_contract.function(data, {gasLimit: gasLimit, gasPrice: gasPrice,});`
`receipt = await tx.wait();`
and `let gasPrice = await signer.getGasPrice();` and `const gasLimit = ethers.BigNumber.from("30_000_000_000_000_000").div(gasPrice );`
What am I doing wrong here?
undefined says I send USDC to address but it's not usual address, it's avalanche USDC contract address
undefined says So that is correct? But but doesn't maxFeePerGas mean, that I am not willing to spend more gas than this? And baseFee is the amount I need to spend at least to do the transaction?
undefined says yeah I have
undefined says I don't understand why max fee should be smaller than actual fee. As I think about it, that should never work. Is there an article I can read about it?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs do you guys know any live project that's using L1 > L2 retryables between Mainnet and Arb? i got some issue with my implementation and trying to check how's the others implementing it
undefined says I'm not going to send it to you who are you? 😄
undefined says your name means nothing for me  I look roles and you have same e role I have
undefined says Will send you the flags that we use, kindly check the message
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Can you send the full docker run command you used to start your node?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says Arbiscan has a list of L1 to L2 transactions, that you can find here => https://arbiscan.io/txsDeposits
You can also share here the issues you might be facing, so we can help with them.
undefined says i'm testing out on testnet and it's weird because in order to send message accross L1 > L2, need to deposit around 1.5 goerli eth meanwhile on arb goerli it only use like 10% of that and the rest of the ETH ended up being refunded to my Arb goerli wallet
undefined says is this normal? @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says How are you estimating the gas parameters? And can we see an example of transaction?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says exactly how your example is on github

Sample tx:

https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x59d48b68da0a4e0d45603cfe0f53a5d8c565a51b2f1c53493c96ee7e7ed96431

undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs guys. i have a problem. And could you help me here plz?
I sent my eth to address which is contract address(0xFd086bC7CD5C481DCC9C85ebE478A1C0b69FCbb9) for USDT in Arbitrum chain. Can your team send it back to my address?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says @gasboy thank you for tagging a mod who will have Green in their profile name. Please don’t assume people helping here are legitimate.
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says Sorry unfortunately we don’t have ability to do it
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs anyone please?
undefined says Hey guys, we have a COMP Governance model DAO on mainnet and use the same contracts to manage the Arbitrum Treasury, we did a governance proposal and had an error when executing a token transfer, the issue is that the failure is on a retry able ticket so we don't understand what was wrong
undefined says Hey looking at it
undefined says Can you console log L1ToL2MessageGasParams and share it with me?
undefined says Is it reverted on L1? Or failed to redeem on L2?
undefined says on L2, I'm not able to decode the data to understand what happened, see if a redeem is needed or something https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc29cc16e9c40704733568df0a5ec67a7ca9a56390d8ac859fbe87f0ac3bcfe52
undefined says Can you share the L1 transaction hash as well?
undefined says sure https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1aec9f125dce482b2aff4ae502d7ca7ed7a719eb6759320e373aa4beba351277
undefined says As you said, your tx is failed on auto redeem. So you need to retry it manually
undefined says You can use our cross-chain dashboard to redeem it:

https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/tx/0x1aec9f125dce482b2aff4ae502d7ca7ed7a719eb6759320e373aa4beba351277
undefined says awesome thanks
undefined says Np!
Feel free to ask if you can’t solve the issue
undefined says Who has it?
undefined says As i saw the transaction and the address on scan, I thought there might be a owner for that address. No?
undefined says Is there a good way to verify a wallet owns an asset (NFT) on mainnet from arbitrum?

The reason I ask is that bridging assets is expensive. I am wondering if I can keep assets on L1 and just make a call from arbitrum to ensure the user owns the asset.
undefined says This is tether address, although it has owner, the owner is not us but tether, you can contact them but I am not sure if they can handle this.
undefined says You can try use some cross chain tools for this, official bridge needs 7 days to send msg from l2 to l1 but you can try some 3rd party solutions.
undefined says Ok thanks
undefined says Thanks.
undefined says Hey folks, I'm trying to tap into the `ProduceAdvancedBlock` with a custom tracer. I've seen that arbitrum prepends one extra tx to the block called `StartTx` but in some cases there seems to be two instead of one extra tx.

When and why does this happen and what is that second extra tx?
undefined says One suggestion to mods, maybe add nitro-development channel because I'm not sure is protocol right channel to ask nitro related questions as it's not directly related to protocol, rather to protocol implementation
undefined says The another tx is used to mention a block start. And we don’t have a fixed block time, you can see how we produce it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/sequencer.go#L981, our minimum block time is 0.25s.
undefined says I've tapped into `transaction_streamer.go` and I'm recording blocks from there. Is that ok or should I move my code for indexing somewhere else?
undefined says Btw can there be two StartTx in one block? One prepended and one appended ?
undefined says just wondering if Arbitrum support evm precompiled contracts?
undefined says hey just wondering for my case, could the issue be because our contract is upgradeable?
undefined says Why Arbitrum has `INVALID` type of call, that appears in some transactions?
For example this tx - https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x6a5ed1f1e5737dcb59b5f378a88b91a66cb842983babe5a614bd78070ea11276#internal
undefined says I see that opcode also in geth, I guess it's not arbitrum specific
undefined says Can you tell me how long it takes to consider a project application for the arbitrum portal ?
undefined says I try to read the output of the sequencer feed (The 'l2mess' because, information's about txs on arbitrum are here).
I'm using python and i didn't found any way, if someone can help me

(i of course read official documentation but i don't know how to do this on python)

Python or Javascript ❤️
undefined says Hey, `INVALID` in not Arbitrum specific. Every `retryable ticket submission`  produces some internal txs that transfer ETH around (for details see here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging) . The reason those txs have `INVALID` opcode is  to represent them in the trace API since they're not actually triggered by an opcode as they're outside of EVM execution.
undefined says Hey, can't provide an exact timeline but can guarantee it does not take long. You can fill out this form to make a request:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw0U-9LcLuih5TZ_QghS-S_MS4wCKSEigA_IQEza_hFmNVow/viewform
undefined says Hey, you could run Arbitrum relay locally as a feed relay and read the data:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says :oldarbitrum: :arbiblobblue:
undefined says okay, but how can i use this : https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L227

with my python / javascript
undefined says We don't support retrieving or parsing the sequencer feed messages outside of the node software.
undefined says there no way to decode the 'l2mess' without node software ?
undefined says I think i found a solution : 
- I run my own nitro run, and i use the wss, subscribes to the sequencer's transaction feed, and listens for incoming transactions.
Do you think it's a good way?
undefined says I just applied 2 days ago, but they didn't even reply to my email
undefined says They take a lot of time to get back
undefined says You need to use base64 to decode first, then you can see how we process it here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/tree/main/packages/batch-tx-handler#l1-batch-handler
undefined says This is to decode the msg sequencer send to l1, which when you use brotli to decompress it, you will get the same thing as what you decode by base64.
undefined says hw
undefined says my arbitrum node keeps throw this error waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429. how to resolve this issue
undefined says me too,  In the Asian region
undefined says me too, even use relayer it still got status: 429 😦
undefined says what's the relay u use? is it not the official one?
undefined says I just follow this to build the relay on my server
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-feed-relay
undefined says ok, so you runs custom feed relay and node, but still have this 429 error?
undefined says yup
undefined says but now my node keep showing `connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`
without status: 429
undefined says like this
undefined says What is this node? Is your running node not relayer right?
undefined says Your running node should connect to the relayer not that url directly.
undefined says yeah I trun off the relayer because relayer also got status: 429 too
undefined says I see, what time is it when you got 429? And do all your node connect to your feed relayer at that time right?
undefined says is about 05-31|06:38:44.431, but I only run one node
undefined says Got it, checking
undefined says and my node got first status: 429 is around 05-31|05:30:17
undefined says Is this est?
undefined says UTC time
undefined says i have just checked the code that feed.input.urls is an array of string, shall i pass comma seperated string if i want to use multiple relays --node.feed.input.url=ws://local-relay-address:9642,wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed ？i am new to nitro, any documents describing the purpose of the relay
undefined says I'm having the same problem, now my main network node is always about 100 blocks short of the nearest block height and keeps reporting failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err=" broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429"
undefined says Is there anything I can do now?
undefined says I keep getting this message on my nitro node, `target` keeps updating but it's not syncing past block `82675437`..

undefined says FWIW the init url I used was https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-archive.tar and not the pruned version which the link in doc was redirecting to, since I wanted to setup an archive node..
undefined says Just to have a look I took a peak into "wscat -c wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed", and the feed is sending out transactions that were confirmed over 300 days ago. Is this expected? I though the Sequencer was just new txs?
undefined says For example, this sequence number is from 65 days ago:
undefined says Or maybe the seq nr is not L2 block number ... hehe
undefined says You need add nitro genesis block number which is about 22m height
undefined says It should be fine now, is your node based on Asia?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs thanks! problem solved
undefined says Hey I want to calculate the ticketId for `redeem(bytes32 ticketId)` in `ArbRetryableTx`  for which the docs say `keccak256(keccak256(ArbchainId, inbox-sequence-number), uint(0) )` in the docs here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/08fa021be9662ebac60843d5274e0b0643c792b3/src/precompiles/ArbRetryableTx.sol#L15 whereas it's the hash of the rlp-encoded here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/6cc143a3bb019dc4c39c8bcc4aeac9f1a48acb01/src/lib/message/L1ToL2Message.ts#L109. Which should I follow?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs or anyone at OL. Can anyone elaborate on what happened this morning. I am running a node in APAC and saw the exact same thing:
`connecting to arbitrum inbox message broadcaster url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed`
undefined says Does anyone know why the gas units used for a txn on Arbitrum Goerli vary so much? Sometimes a txn will use around 70k gas (similar amount to on mainnet), then twenty minutes later 380k gas (similar to amount on Arbitrum One). Do different nodes run different gas calculations?
undefined says (There's a longer tweet on it (@arrngcaptain))
undefined says Hi! 
I just deployed an ownable upgradable contract to Arbitrum-One with hardhat cli using plugins from
- `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol`
- `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol)`
and I was able to verify the contract (`0x1B725110D01820Cd6887A5b4092648Ea20bdF0ec`) 

but when I tried to call function that's limited to the owner, I found that the owner field was set to 0x000..., instead of my deployer account which is supposed to be the default of owner address when deploying the contract. 
Ownership for this contract has previously worked fine on Eth mainnet, so the field being somehow set to 0x0 is new to me.

Do you have any idea why this is and if I need to update the contract, in particular with those openzepplin imports when I deploy it on arbitrum?
undefined says Have you called initialize()?
undefined says (Also, FWIW, the pattern of deploying uninitialised contracts makes my skin crawl lol. You might consider deploying a small 'factory' contract that will deploy your contracts and call the initialise in the same transaction, that way they can never be taken over by someone else).
undefined says oh god, thanks for the tip! it seems like I accidentally removed a  `constructor() { _disableInitializers(); }` 😓 . I understand the problem now, thanks again!
undefined says No problem at all :arbifrog:
undefined says Just follow the sdk way
undefined says APAC has some connection issues yesterday, but now it should resolve.
undefined says This is because l1 gas price increase, you can see how we calculate gas here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas#breaking-down-the-formula
undefined says Thanks for the reply.
undefined says It's not that though. As the gas units calculated for the same transaction vary wildly over time.
undefined says Yeah, this is because Extra Buffer for L1 cost (B) increase, which leads Gas Limit (G) increases
undefined says We have the formula at that page
undefined says And L1 Estimated Cost (L1C) = L1 price per byte of data (L1P) * Size of data to be posted in bytes (L1S)
undefined says Yup, I get all that. But the same transaction is sometimes costing 70k gas units, and 20 minutes later 356,000. Both have the same payload so should incur roughly the same L1 fees. L1 fees do move, but in the 20 minute period they hadn't (and certainly not by 500%).
undefined says What it looks very much like is some nodes running a consensus that doesn't calcualte the L1 fees, as the lower gas unit calc (the 70k) is exactly the same as we see on L1 s (e.g. mainnet, eth goerli).
undefined says (I would post links to the transactions if I could lol 😃 )
undefined says Oh yeah, let's see if it will let me post those...
First txn (73k gas units) 0xed0cb9f8f029c1d3a3edaf888b7e62928ac0e42ab4084f97c3aa7fd3b4cbac5d
Second txn (356k gas units) 0xee5bb6ebd67b2e4b9127e9425a447fee24983c6f7993ab02f074fbc43800e02e
Both on Arbitrum goerli
undefined says Goerli gas price sometimes will increase 10x at a short period, so in 20 minutes the gas price increase 5x I think it is normal. Because now goerli has a large tx number.
undefined says Ah interesting. Thank you.
undefined says (I typed a longer reply but the server didn't like it lol)
undefined says my node stucks here

undefined says Any devs here
undefined says thanks for the answer but this form doesn't work.
undefined says Will this be sufficient enough to start program with ?
undefined says It is normal, classic node needs more time to start, sometimes will more than 1 day. It depends on your disk latency.
undefined says Hey, it is because you don’t shutdown gracefully, just wait it to repair. Next time you can use docker stop —time=300 $(docker ps -aq) to shutdown.
undefined says Yup, it’s enough.
undefined says Ok thx I appreciated it
undefined says I'm Akila, representing Mummy Finance - a leading Spot & Perpetual Decentralized Exchange and the #1 GMX fork across all chains.

We have plans to launch our protocol on Arbitrum and would like to connect with the Foundation for a detailed discussion. Could you please assist me in reaching out to the person in charge?

Thank you in advance.
undefined says saa
undefined says Hey, welcome to Arbitrum, you can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com, then our bd team will contact you later.
undefined says hey guys, how is everyone doing?

i was just doing some dune queries for stablecoin and found out an unusual result, there is discripancy on the total stables that were bridged from Ethereum and the total stablecoins that are on the arbitrum stable address

for reference, this is my finding
USDT 450M bridged vs Arbitrum USDT Supply 375M
USDC 1.178B bridged vs Arbitrum USDC Supply 1.146B

can someone please clear out if there is anything that i am missing here? the supply of bridged vs present on Arbitrum should be equal, isn't it?
undefined says Hey, that might because some token is on l2 -> l1 bridging and not claimed on l1.
undefined says Hey, I'm currently trying out running local dev node using `./test-node.bash`. I wanted to add some logs to geth and monitor interactions and flows, so I pulled the go-ethereum submodule and edited that. 

Then I noticed that by default, `/test-node.bash` uses a geth docker container. So I tried it again with the `--dev `flag, but for some reason there's always an error halfway during the build. I'm basically trying out other combinations (`./test-node.bash --init --dev --build`), which worked like once, but is not working on the second try... What could possibly be the issue here??
undefined says oh ok, is there a way to verify this?
undefined says the value should be accurate no? it was a huge difference that i am witnessing
undefined says can you provide me with the address Jason, i am tackling this the first time and would really appretiate your help on this!!
undefined says Before you look into this, you might need to know how our bridge works: https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#canonical-token-bridge-implementation, our funds need 7 days to withdraw back. And we have bridgeBurn function when withdrawal: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol#L36, you can see how usdt implement here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf31e1ae27e7cd057c1d6795a5a083e0453d39b50#code, also about all address of bridge info, you can see here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf31e1ae27e7cd057c1d6795a5a083e0453d39b50#code
undefined says thanks, i am familiar with the concept, i just wanted to see the remaining USDT value

so you are saying that it goes through the burn mechanism to be available on ethereum correct? is that the address where the burn takes place?
undefined says Usdt address: https://arbiscan.io/token/0xfd086bc7cd5c481dcc9c85ebe478a1c0b69fcbb9
undefined says This logic is within usdt contract.
undefined says it does get burned, so there is no address that would hold that remaining USDT?
undefined says can it be said that any address aiming to redeem USDT goes through the interaction of the link you just provided me?
undefined says Yeah, you can see that logic, it will decrease the total supply directly.
undefined says yeah, but it still isn't clear to me transaction wise

so you are saying that any one aiming to withdraw USDT goes through the interaction of the address you provided me and it takes 7 days for it to execute on Ethereum, so the remaining 75M is under this process?
undefined says Another case is when user deposit usdt, there is some errors when execute on l2 side (most case is gas not enough), but they forget to redeem it later and that retryables got expired. Also is usdt used another gateway before, so it have another address on l2, but I am not sure about this. Those are the potential case which may cause to this.
undefined says i understand, but for it to be redeemed the token should be somewhere no? in some address
undefined says You can see this: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#retryable-tickets, if retryable execution failed, it will revert like others evm transaction, so it won’t mint. (But ethers will refund to refundAddress)
undefined says Our erc20 bridge is lock-mint bridge, not liquidity bridge.
undefined says so you are saying that the remaining funds will be minted and isn't store somewhere, so after the period is over it will be minted on the destination i.e. Ethereum for this case
undefined says When your erc20 transfer to l2, it will lock it on l1 and mint it on l2, when you want to bridge back, it will burn on l2 and later you can redeem it on l1 then it will unlock your token.
undefined says Why do you say the Sequencer is in the US when the ping is minimized in Canada?
undefined says Maybe I am pinging in the cloudflare provider
undefined says got it, the l2 -> l1 bridging takes a week and requires a burn mechanism that is why the token is unavailable to be seen,
undefined says Gm! Just ran into this:
> OPCODE push0 is not yet supported, but will soon be available.
Any ETA on when this will be available on Arbitrum?
undefined says Not ETA yet, sorry. But we will announce when it's available.
undefined says Days/weeks/months?
undefined says I have a question about the block numbers on arbitrum .. lets say I want to check each transaction in each block to see if either the to or from fields match a list of addresses. Can I do this using the layer 1 (eth main net) block numbers? I have been able to do it using the arbitrum block number i get from the RPC , but this is kind of tricky as the block numbers increment so quickly and  without any static amount of time in between them  ...
undefined says guys is there a way to get the address of ERC20 token if i want to bridge tokens from ETH to Arbitrum before the actual bridge, can i query it on some contract on L1 or L2?
undefined says How long does it take to respond to this mail partnerships@offchainlabs.com
I have a running project on arbitrum nova. I really want to cooperate with the arbitrum ecosystem. Having written to this mail, I still have not received a response
undefined says 👋, can I get some help here please? Thanks!
undefined says I try to set the gas parameters for a arbitrum one transaction, but if I try to call 
`const gasEstimateComponents = await nodeInterface.callStatic.gasEstimateComponents("0x...",false, txData);`
I get the error: 
`Error: missing revert data in call exception; Transaction reverted without a reason string...`
Is there another way to estimate gas? 
If I understand correctly, I need to set `gasLimit`, `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` right?
Is it possible to do so with `let feeData = await provider.getFeeData();` (I tried but I am getting an error all the time)
undefined says regarding the atomicity of block updates in nodes: 

when a node receives updates from the sequencer and updates its local state is the entire block updated in one atomic update ? 

for example if there is a swap transaction and I check the balance in a smart contract is it guaranteed that both balances will have been updated ? Or are changes applied incrementally please ?
undefined says If you check that balance before and after that block, you will see they all update in atomic. But if you check it during the contract run time called by another contract, that balance is update follow the logic execution, you can test it locally, we process this like others evm chains do.
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says You can call 0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef calculateL2TokenAddress
undefined says 
undefined says i'm trying to interact with the ArbOwner precompile at 0x70

on arbiscan it looks like there's no 'contract' deployed at the address and when I try to call the precompile at the addresds 0x70 i get a revert CALL_EXCEPTION

the arbitrum sdk is also missing any constant representing the ArbOwner precompile address

How do we interact with that precompile?

---

also the auto moderation on this discord server is super annoying. can use keywords like "h-e-y" or "h-i", can't post links, slow-mode.
undefined says What do I need to do to get into the arbitrum ecosystem?
undefined says L1->L2 messages can be force included after waiting maxTimeVariation (24 hours currently) and will autoredeem if the L2 balance has enough eth to pay gasFee*gasLimit.

But can't the sequencer cause a denial of service by increasing the L2 base fee so auto redemption will fail, requiring 'manual redemption' which would repeat another 24 hour censorship period?

As far as I can tell from the ArbGasInfo precompile and the exponential pricing model minimumBaseFee * exp(alpha * (backlog-tolerance)), to cause an auto redemption failure when an L2 balance has 1 eth to pay for L2 gas fees on auto redemption, it would take a backlog of ~17 billion L2 gas. Here alpha is 1/(inertia*speedLimit) = 1/(102*7_000_000), and tolerance is more or less negligble is 70_000_000.

Is there a maximum gas per block? otherwise the sequencer could cause a ~17 billion L2 gas backlog when the L2 base fee is at its minimum, 0.1 gwei, which would cost 1.7 eth. Then everyone would be prices out of arbitrum for about 17 billion / 7 million = 40 minutes which the backlog is worked through and L2 fees exponentially drop back down to 0.1 gwei from over 1 eth.
undefined says How / where do I do that?
undefined says sounds like a scam. . . good luck with that


anyways. . .

after some digging it looks like that is a per block gas limit of

InitialPerBlockGasLimitV0 uint64 = 20 * 1000000

so this is the max gas spent before the exponential l2 pricing updates?
undefined says Hey, if you are not owner, call arbOwner precompile will always revert
undefined says Yes, it is scam, already banned.
undefined says 
undefined says You can query the chain speed of gas limit here github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/a68783436b5105a64f54efe5fbd55174704a7618/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L80
undefined says i know there's a 7 million gas speed limit.

i'm worried about spiking l2 gas fees causing censorship resistant l1->l2 force inclusion messages to fail auto redemption.

causing a gas backlog would cause a spike in l2 gas fees.

on mainnet there is a 30 million gas limit per block, after which the base fee will update.

it looks like nitro also has a block gas limit of 20 million gas? just from looking at the arbos state scripts to process new blocks.
undefined says there's some irony because getting the current owners is a view function in arbOwner so no one except the owner can check.

also the automoderation on this discord channel creates a terrible developer experience. Half of my messages are censored triggering some zealous keyword filter. If you want to provide a better developer experience, make it easier for developers to ask questions.
undefined says The block limit is 32m, which you should see InitialPerBlockGasLimitV6, and when gas usage per second higher than 7m, the gas price will increase (like eip1559 does).

undefined says ETH的txHash是：0x2d18262b55119d9b4e4c698abc4e2810becfaef5a45315db8db4c8978ec4a5a2
undefined says @Jose FP#6468 how do I validate this value? Looking at the l2pricing in the arbos, it looks like InitialPerBlockGasLimitV0 is set by default
undefined says L37 of l2pricing.go

The arbGasInfo precompile can fetch the gas pool parameter which is 32 million, but the comments on the function stub of the interface say after nitro this value should be zero. Is this actually the per block gas limit? How do we check the current per block gas limit?
undefined says 已在别处看到你发的消息并且回复了
undefined says The block gas limit set was default set to InitialPerBlockGasLimitV6 rather than v0
undefined says 
undefined says github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbos/arbosState/arbosstate.go#L325
undefined says And the pool size returned now is block gas limit value: github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.go#L146
undefined says 
undefined says okay thanks, by my calculations, the sequencer can spend 70k eth to raise the baseFee to 10,000 gwei, possibly to deny service to txn forceInclusion which set a maxFeePerGas at the time of ticket creation. I did this in a google colab notebook.

 I would love to share, but, the discord auto moderation rules don't allow sharing links. Imo  this is a detriment to fostering a good developer community.

So if I want to include a transaction which probably can't be censored, I could leave my l2 balance with several eth, and use unsafeCreateRetryableTicket to create a ticket with a maxFeePerGass at 10,000 gwei. Unlike the safe retryable ticket, I can avoid providing any msg.value and just rely on the fact that I have sufficient l2 balance?
undefined says So it looks like getting the address of the "network fee collector" is done via the ArbOwner precompile, but strangely the entire precompile requires authentication as the arbOwner. 

Is this the L2 fee collector? Where does the l2 base fee go? I saw some news about 'surplus' l2 base fee going to the arb dao treasury, but shouldn't 100% be sent to the arb treasury?

I just want to avoid economic incentives where the cenetralized sequencer can grief the unhappy censorship resistant path by causing the base fee to spike, but the sequencer could collect the base fees paid and get away with a 'zero cost' censorship attack
undefined says okay I just realized there is an ArbOwnerPublic precompile at 0x06b, hah, okay well atleast I can access key information this way. I just made a small PR into the arb sdk to add this key constant for a precompile.

So it noticed the differences between the infraFeeAccount and the networkFeeAccount which are indeed where the L2 fee surplus and L2 base fee are sent respectively. As far as I can tell, surplus eth sent with the execution of L1 to L2 retryable ticket messages is sent to the L2 fee surplus address. For example if L2 gas cost is below the specified MaxFeePerGas parameter of the retryable ticket AND if the retryable ticket lacks a refund address, then the eth is sent to the infraFeeAccount.

Is that correct?
undefined says 
undefined says I’m trying to understand how deposits through the `ArbRetryableTx` contract work and how fees are computed.

For instance, given the following wallet *0x4ee6612e889490b2b5d7b585b4d6a92c3991400f*.

If we compare the balance of this wallet using the `eth_getBalance` RPC method on block 44,085,008 and 44,085,009. We can see that this wallet received **0.000251448947459584 ETH**.
Looking on Arbiscan, we can see that this deposit was made from the transaction *0x013989c575e0ed34584a407c7ca62db3cf7147d9baab69bca29b438702da26e2* and if we look at input data, we see a deposit amount of **0.000260369347459584 ETH**. There is therefore a difference of **0.0000089204 ETH** which I believe correspond to the fees of this deposit (am I wrong?).

I first thought that this is just an internal transaction however if we look at internals, we see two transactions to the wallet but there are marked as **Invalid** and if we sum values we don’t get the correct amount.
I’ve also tried to use the `Inbox.calculateRetryableSubmissionFee` method, as explained in the FAQ, but I don’t get a correct value neither.

I’m desperately trying to find or query this information on the block... Is there a way? Any help of this would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks
undefined says I'm trying to collect traces from EVM when creating blocks inside `ProduceBlockAdvanced` function but for some reason I cannot collect LOG traces for txs going to precompiles. Are precompiles not executed inside EVM and where could I plug in my tracer to collect log traces?
undefined says 
undefined says For example this TX has two logs but no LOG traces `0xc32690af2254a9f6e988db01ac9dfddf1464468b912a01e0ae2f6c724fb4195e`
undefined says You're correct that precompiles are not implemented as an EVM contract. That said, we do try to provide good support for tracing them, e.g. we'll add fake SSTORE/SLOAD opcodes to the traces to represent when the precompiles access storage. We'll work on also creating fake LOG opcodes in traces but it might be a bit before we implement it. Thanks for the suggestion!
undefined says I'm not sure if I got your question correctly, but force inclusion is happening on L1 not L2.
So you will send your L2 transaction through L1, by calling one of the functions we have on delayed inbox (one way is, wait to use retryable creation, but there are other methods you can see on our delayed inbox contract)
after that you can wait and see if our sequencer will pick up your transaction. if not after then force inclusion period (currently 24h) you can force include it on L1. So you compoletely bypassed sequencer. Nodes and validators will pick up your force included transaction from L1
undefined says So if you use retryable path to create your L2 transaction by submitting it on L1, then force include it, the retryable ticket will be created. in case that L2 gas price is spiky at the moment of force inclusion, your ticket would be generated, but the redeem may fail due to lack of L2 fees.
You can redeem that ticket in the future to execute the L2 transaction when L2 gas price get normal
undefined says Hey,
on arbiscan you can see this image, shows that the value that is sent from L1 with retyable is 0.000260369347459584, which is transferred to Arb bridge on L2. 0.000039363454715728 amount is paid for network fee to create retryable ticket, and 0.0000275 as network fee for redeeming etc
Then 0.000055 refunded back to your address as extra fees that is deducted at first.
So totally you received 0.000138505892743856 + 0.000055
the network fee would be 0.0000275 + 0.000039363454715728 - 0.000055 (it will be paid back by network fee collector to the bridge)
undefined says I'd like to get the L1 pr1c3 per byte of calldata. I've got the priceInWei from ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei (second component)  then I divided by the current gas pr1c3 on L1 that is 60 GWEI and I've got 6.95.  Is that correct or am I missing anything?
undefined says I want to launch my project on arbitrum nova (it is completely ready). Who should I contact?
undefined says how do i get to the arbitrum portal?
undefined says there should not be any mev on arbitrum right? btw I foudn an address that always set his tx at index 1. How is it possible?
undefined says we are building our web3 project on Arbitrum and would love to apply for your grant. Is there a place where I could find all the guidelines that need to be met for it?
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs I am trying to generate a proof for a L2 => L1 transaction. It looks like the size argument from constructOutboxProof() comes from the arbSys call sendMerkleTreeState() but when I call it, the transaction reverts. there is no revert message but when I make other calls to arbSys, they go through.
undefined says Hey, the second component returned from `ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei` *is* the  actual L1 gas price in wei per L1 calldata byte. You don't have to change that value if it's whatyou're looking for.
undefined says Hey, please contact our partnerships at `partnerships@offchainlabs.com`.
undefined says You'd need to fill out the form provided here:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw0U-9LcLuih5TZ_QghS-S_MS4wCKSEigA_IQEza_hFmNVow/viewform
undefined says Yes, MEV is infeasible on Arbitrum. The first transaction is an special transactions that merely updates the internal parameters such as timstamp etc. It's not a grneral transaction.
undefined says Hey, there is no official Arbitrum grant at the time for new projects building on Arbitrum. You can reach out to `partnerships@offchainlabs.com` to find out more though.
undefined says Are you trying to get the proof for a given L2-L1 transaction?
If yes, our SDK provides a method for that: 
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/f1ba67f0855d07b37e08cf81c3a34ca664732b6d/src/lib/message/L2ToL1Message.ts#L204
undefined says Yes I am not refering to index 0 but index 1.
undefined says there is a user that always place his tx at index 1, not every block. just the ones he need. Could be a malicous validator?
undefined says it is a user that interact with contracts so I don't think it the the tx your were refering to
undefined says No it can't be. A malicious validator can **only** propose wrong state roots, which will be challenged and eventually discarded.
One case that I can think of is when you send your tx to an rpc provider, and they may order your tx first and then send it to the sequencer.
undefined says I am running my own node. Would help a feed relay ? I don't think so I read that it is useless for only 1 node right?
undefined says That's correct. There is no need to run a feed relay when you're  running a single node.
undefined says then I have no idea on how it could be possible🥲. The only thing I noticed is that he send type 0 txs. Nothing else.
Probably he has his own node in the same datacenter of the sequencer 😂
undefined says yeah maybe
undefined says the type of the tx (Legacy) doesn' affect the speed right?
undefined says No ser it doesn't
undefined says One last thing. I noticed that when I submit a tx to my node (script and node on the same server) , it takes always different time, sometimes 400ms others 200ms others 600ms. Any reason?
undefined says And what does **time** refer to here?
undefined says the time between the start of my async call and the log of the submission on docker logs
undefined says I also noticed that even if on my docker logs I see that the tx has been submitted at .10.036 for istance
When I check the timestamp of the block on etherscan in reality is is .9 (ms not shown)
undefined says There are a few things to consider here:
1. eth_sendRawTransaction is better being sent directly to https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io
2. There can be variable network latency between different datacenters as well as internal network infrastructure
3. Transactions are handled on a first come first serve basis, so there will be natural variation depending on how busy the chain is
undefined says so I can send directly a rawTx to that rpc?
undefined says like this
undefined says 👍
undefined says I emailed this a few days ago and no one has replied to me.
undefined says This form is not working! ''You need permission''
undefined says Now the form is working! How long does it take to process an application?

undefined says I see your project marked as Invalid entry, you may input wrong values or miss some values.
undefined says It depends, about 1 week, but may take longer.
undefined says Thank you for responding. How do I fix this ? I am completely open!
undefined says I'm not the person who reviews portal applications, but I can ask for you
undefined says I would be very grateful to you for that

undefined says Thanks for the answer! When I filled out the form, I used both the website and Twitter. I'll fill out the form again today!
undefined says Thanks! This means that in this formula:

L2 gas used + ( L1 calldata pr1c3 * L1 calldata size) / (L2 gas pr1c3)

it's L1 calldata pr1c3?

failed connect to sequencer broadcast, waiting and retrying url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed err="broadcast client unable to connect: unexpected HTTP response status: 429"`
undefined says having same issue, node also failed connect to sequencer broadcast
undefined says FWIW, we started to see this issue about 40 mins ago.
undefined says btw do you know ther server the sequencer uses to sync time?
I noticed from my node logs that I am 20/30ms ahead because on a contract it shows the timestamp of the tx which has a difference of 1 sec in the past (milliseconds are not shown in solidity).
For example:
Node Tx Log: `1686135956026`
Solidity Timestamp: `1686135955`
undefined says is that not just the propagation time of the block? also 20 / 30 ms is within NTP sync error
undefined says Yes that is my initial idea. For this reason I wanted to know if there is a way to find the server the sequencer uses to sync
undefined says Nice try weather boy, just use something close to your server and you can adjust the NTP sync settings to get a lower error.
undefined says something is wrong with arbitrum feed ?
undefined says one of my 2 full nodes was able to reconnect, the one with the beta new version of nitro, I guess because it's spamming reconnection less that release version and thus avoided limitation rate error 429 after reconnection or something

undefined says Can you follow this Troubleshooting guide and post the result here?
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes
undefined says where can I get an up to date list of all the coins on arbitrum please ? I tried arbitrum-token-lists but the command to create full list isnt working
undefined says are transactions timestamped as they arrive at the sequencer or load balancer?
undefined says Whats current block time, is it fixed?
undefined says whys the sequencer feed sending me blocks from a year ago :hmm:
undefined says There isn't any official token list. The token list used by Arbitrum's bridge right now is generated from L1 tokens on Uniswap, Gemini and Coinmarketcap token lists.
undefined says Transactions are timestamped when the Sequencer picks them from the queue
undefined says Not sure if you're referring to this, but Arbitrum One produces between 1-4 blocks per second. It's not a fixed value.
undefined says How are you connecting to it and what result are you getting that's confusing?
undefined says is sequenceNumber the blocknumber or am i confusing it
undefined says it's very fast, will it increase over time or will it remain like this forever even after decentralization occur?
undefined says 
undefined says sequenceNumber is the number the sequencer assigns to that message (like the nonce for the Sequencer posted messages). You can get the timestamp and the l1 blocknumber inside the "header"
undefined says No changes are planned about that
undefined says do u know how to rlp decode type 2 tx, the `0300000000000000` prefix confuses me, legacy tx have 04 as prefix, i can decode those :hmm:
undefined says You can check this go method to help you decoding it => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L227
undefined says thank you
undefined says ah the 03 is not a signedtx, its batch okay got it @José FP | Offchain Labs thx
undefined says why don't use a fixed time like 0.5 secs per block like on ethereum?
undefined says I'm interested in testing a contract deployment on arbitrum testnet but am having trouble getting some testnet arbitrum goerli. I have some goerli ETH but the bridge only seems to support mainnet bridging. What's the best way to get some arbitrum testnet ETH?
undefined says Did you use https://bridge.arbitrum.io? It supports goerli bridge.
undefined says We don’t have consensus like pos to generate block, so no need to use a fixed block time.
undefined says Tried but only seeing Mainnet, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova as sources and destinations
undefined says any solution found?
undefined says also is there anyway to force a resync from a provided block even if the node is already caught up and at latest head?
undefined says You need to change your l1 network to goerli first
undefined says You mean re-sync?
undefined says What is the difference between arb1 and arb1-sequencer endpoints?
undefined says Could you provide me your start command?
undefined says yes but only from the specified block, not from the genesis
undefined says 
undefined says ughh
```

undefined says This command looks good, does it show that errors?
undefined says yes
undefined says I just use your command to run, it works, can you send me the full error logs?
undefined says I’m try to send a transaction cost more than 30m gas, and revert with out of gas error now. The code must execute at the same time, I have move every logic that can execute separately. Is there a way to improve the gas limit?
undefined says there is no gas limit
undefined says But the transaction did failed with out of gas
undefined says can you share it? probably you reache the cap.
undefined says Called estiamteGas with hardhat, cost more than 32m gas and failed
undefined says it is hardhat issue I think
undefined says Try this

`module.exports = {
    networks: {
        hardhat: {
            blockGasLimit:  10000000// whatever you want here
        },
    }
}`
undefined says Can anyone tell if there is any difference between arb1 and arb1-sequencer endpoints? Is it possible to subscribe directly to sequencer feed? Seems the arb1-sequencer endpoint does not accept WS connections
undefined says Thanks, will try it later. I thought it was the gas cost reached the limit
undefined says gasLimit: Value is fixed at 0x4000000000000, but it's important to note that Arbitrum currently has a 32M gas limit per block
undefined says it doesn't
depends on the node you are using
you can cap it
default value is 50M
undefined says Which rpc you prefer? So there is no cap for single transaction gas?
undefined says my own node
undefined says I don't know if you'd like to share, I can pay for it if it works
undefined says sorry i can't
undefined says It's ok. Do you know where I can find or run a node like yours?
undefined says #🔗︱links check this
undefined says I recently filled out an announcement form on the arbitrum portal platform. They answered me the following
"Unfortunately, our team was unable to find an audit report with all
critical/high risks eliminated in the application"
Where can I get this audit report? Through which platform can this be done? I can provide code. I also want to say that I am completely open.
undefined says Thanks bro
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs gm 👋 could someone help @sambaru please with https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/1643
undefined says Looked at the issue, initializing the node off of https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/arb1/nitro-pruned.tar could probably resolve it
undefined says I would be very grateful if you could help me resolve this issue.  I don't know where else to turn.
undefined says You could find out how to get your contracts audited by searching on Google. Unfortunately, we can't provide any advice.
undefined says how come HTTP is faster than IPC for sending tx?
undefined says The question is , which companies do you accept audits from ?
undefined says I have a question. If I deploy token on arbiturm, there will be no front running for it?
In Ethereum chain, there were front running for meme tokens.
undefined says Would you please forward this question to partnerships@offchainlabs.com?
undefined says There is no mempool here on Arbitrum so front-ruuning is techincally infeasible.
undefined says Thank you, I wrote, I hope this time I will at least get an answer.
undefined says man, thank you.  I realized that it's not worth trying to deploy your project in the arbitrum. After reading all your correspondence, I got the impression that admins don't care about new projects at all. You have to write several times to be heard, why are you trying? The audit of a smart contract is done by different platforms, for example cetrik, it's not cheap. Alternatively, you can try other L2 blockchains. If you have a ready-made project, you can try where it is friendlier.
undefined says man) I know there are other L2. the choice fell on arbitrum nova because it has the lowest transactions. I believe that it will be possible to get to the arbitrum portal.

undefined says Hey, we very much welcome projects to be deployed on arbitrum, but because some projects were rug after the portal list, we have to strictly review the newly added projects on the portal. And this channel is related to technology, so many of your questions are not very clear to us. As mahsa said, you can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says I am very happy, they answered my e-mail) I need to pass an audit and soon I will be on the arbitrum portal
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs 
Can one send an email using personal email or project email address?
undefined says Sorry, I don’t get what you mean. Is this question related to arbitrum?
undefined says 
undefined says I want to know block time in testnet!
how to get block time in testnet?
The mainnet block time chart exist in mainnet arbiscan chart page.
undefined says We don’t have fixed block time, it depends on the network, but the minimum block time is 0.25s
undefined says Is there any ETA for decentralized sequencer? also i wonder if tx fees will be lower once the usage rises or is it the best tx fee we will ever have (and will worsen once usage has raised)
undefined says Question on GAS: how do I calculate how much gas is going to be charged as part of the L1 vs the L2 component for a given TX ahead of time?
undefined says Look at the NodeInterface pseudo-precompile, it has a method to estimate the L1 and L2 components at the same time
undefined says `gasEstimateComponents` IIRC
undefined says Could someone give me the e-mail address of the people dealing with cybersecurity?
undefined says We don’t have a specific time for it! 
Transaction fees on Arbitrum depends on the demand similar to ethereum mainnet.
Note that we have 2-D fees. So the fee that users would be charged depends on the L1 base fee as well.
For more info read this part of our docs:

undefined says hey guys, we've built a project on L2 (Arb) and we want to make the same project token available on L1. What is the best way to use the asset bridge to make this happen? On L1, it needs to burn and mint as needed. not the other way around as described on the documentation. Anyone done this? Any pointers to make this happen would be very much appreciated. Thank you
undefined says We are on Arbitrum One.
undefined says Hey, do you mean your end goal is to deploy a token on L1 that needs to be bridgeable to L2 (Arb One)?
undefined says Or you'd like to bridge your L2 token to L1?
undefined says Yes I want to know what is the best path to making the same L2 token available on L1. We launched first on L2. We want to setup a dex pool for the same project on L1.
undefined says but need both to be inter changeable between L1 and L2
undefined says Bridge l2 token to L1 and make it available for trades on dex like uniswap pool
undefined says Got it. In this case you need to use our reverse custom gateway which allows you to mint tokens and track supply on the L2 rather than L1. Tokens on L2 are escrowed by the gateway, then bridgeMint/burned on L1:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ReverseCustomGateway.sol
undefined says Amazing. Exactly what i was looking to do. Do i have to launch the token on L1, or when we bridge first time, it will launch on its own? Thank you very much.
undefined says Is this a contract we launch on L2 or on L1?
undefined says You don't have to launch the token on L1, the L1 counterpart will be created when bridged for the first time. Just note that your L2 token needs to conform to this interface:

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x096760F208390250649E3e8763348E783AEF5562
undefined says Wow thank you. I will try first and if I run into any issues I will come back. Very helpful!!’ Thank you so much
undefined says Absolutely! Hope it all works smoothly!
undefined says how to run an arbitrum test node? i just change l1.url and chain id alright?
undefined says You mean run arbitrum goerli? If so, that’s correct.
undefined says Is anyone using the arbscan API for tokenTxHistory? I think there haven't been any updates since May 2023. My token transaction history is not updating currently. I am using the "'ERC20-Token Transfer Event' by Address" to check the address '0x13E10daB214fc476E816C62c74d923b30AfcCb2A'.
undefined says Is there an issue with arbiscan verifying contracts right now? Can't seem to verify any new deployments via Foundry
undefined says Hey, could you share with me your request url?
undefined says 
undefined says I see your latest tx for that token is at block 100957512, while your request only to 99999999
undefined says Oh! It has been resolved now! I sincerely appreciate your assistance!
undefined says Sorry miss this, you can try it later, sometimes arbiscan under maintenance can not verify contracts.
undefined says Okay great - tried this yesterday so I'll try again later and see if it works 🙂
undefined says Hello!!! Is it possible to discover a range of L2 blocks based on a L1 block? In short, I want to query events/logs from an Arbitrum RPC node, but I only have the L1 block number.
undefined says I am facing the same issue. Did you figure this out ?
undefined says Do you have l1 rpc? You can query the batch submitter’s txn and you will see prevMessageCount and newMessageCount, you can add 22207817 that is the l2 block range.
undefined says Seems the database crashed, You need to let your node sync normally, you can restart your node, and it will resume the database, when it back to sync, try prune again.
undefined says wondering what happens when EIP 4844 is eventually adopted and we have data-blobs.. it should make TX on ARB much cheaper (maybe by 100x).  What will that do to L2 fees? they remain unchanged right?
undefined says generally any savings from 4844 will be passed onto ARB's users
undefined says 
undefined says Where can I find more information about the ticket creation (submit) and redeems in nitro? I need to understand how the process work, how fees are computed (who pays the redeem fees), which internal transactions it generates, which addresses are involved and, in general, what the lifecycle of  a l1 to l2 message is. Similar to what is described in the l1-to-l2-messaging doc but for nitro.
@Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @José FP | Offchain Labs @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says which l1-to-l2 doc are you referring to? Our docs at https://developer.arbitrum.io/ are almost all related to Nitro. It goes a lot deeper on the inner workings of the protocol in the "Learn More" section
undefined says What's the best way to estimate gas for the _next_ block?
undefined says I tried onchain gas oracle and node.SuggestGasPrice(). They both return current block.
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  help please? ☝️
undefined says What is the correct and long term testnet to use on arbitrum since on eth mainnet goerli is being deprecated I’m currently using arbitrum nitro testnet on goerli
undefined says I am running my own arbitrum node.
It has been running with a good status, but I have been getting the "missing trie node" error a few hours ago.
Could any one tell me what's wrong with it, and how to fix it?
Thank you!
undefined says 
undefined says You can use metaswap api:

https://gas-api.metaswap.codefi.network/networks/42161/suggestedGasFees
undefined says Ew currently just support Goerli, but will move to Sepolia soon
undefined says This may happens due to various reasons, the main one could be if your L1 node is not sync
undefined says I've created my first a smart contract in Remix and wanted to deploy it on Arbitrum. However, I was surprised to see that the deployment cost was more than $130 USD. Despite the contract's complexity, I successfully deployed it on the Arbitrum testnet, and everything seems to be functioning perfectly. However, I'm still unsure if there might be an underlying problem or if this high cost is expected??  Of course, each contract is different.. I’m just curious if this sounds out of the ordinary? Any insight would be appreciated.
undefined says No, it should not cost as this, usually when a tx will fail, the estimateGas will be super high, and may I ask what is your solidity compiler version?
undefined says thank you, I'll have a check with that.
undefined says Thanks for the response. It’s version 0.8.18. Though, I have a feeling that the issue may be the contract size itself. The size is 28873 bytes and while the warning in Remix goes away when I turn on optimization, I’m afraid this still may be too large and I’ll need to split the contract into multiple parts. Any thoughts?
undefined says i can only see mainnet in here
undefined says Facing a similar issue

deploy is being quoted at a really high gwei (3.2) even when arbi gas is 0.01 and there's no congestion on mainnet

even using another RPC doesn't work
undefined says Oh, the size is too large, you should spilt your contract.
undefined says When your tx might fail, the gas will be extremely high, please check your tx.
undefined says Why can't i see following for L1 in Arbitrum Testnet ??

1_Poster Fee or 
2_L1 Gas Usage
undefined says 
undefined says The gas isn’t extremely high though, I’ve deployed to other testnet without fail, and my contact sizes aren’t too bad
undefined says Oh, sorry, you can manually set it lower or just keep it at that value, we will only charge the network base price no matter how high you set.
undefined says Because goerli gas price not so high, so sometimes your l1 gas used will be 0.
undefined says So even if it’s the 3.2 gwei that I  see i quoted in foundry, the real costs will be much lower
undefined says Where did you fork it, does that node fully synced?
undefined says Yes, but deploy contracts will cost a much higher gas limit than normal tx.
undefined says Also how sensitive is gas to multiple contracts deployments in one block? Could also be an issue here
undefined says Guys guys
undefined says It depends on gas usage, If gas usage per second above 8m, the gas price will be higher.
undefined says Tried multiple archive nodes that I found on Chainlist.org and also Alchemy node. Do you know an RPC for a fully synced node perhaps?
undefined says could someone point me towards the standard calldata compression libraries used within Nitro?
undefined says Is it possible to write a smart contract that can store the exact transaction fee that was charged for its specific function execution ?
I appreciate your response on this..
undefined says Question for the team; we use Dune Analytics to report on gas costs for Arbitrum for nodes we run. We notice Dune analytics is incorrect on gas token calculation by factors of about 10,000x starting on August 31 and backwards. The nitro upgrade happened at this time. 

I'd like to accelerate Dune correcting this data, so wanted to reach out to see if anyone here could think of why their data might be off, specifically as it relates to the nitro migration.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I used the arbitrum bridge to move USDC from mainnet to ARB 1.5 days ago and have not received it yet. Who can help me with this?
undefined says Provide the wallet address
undefined says no thanks
undefined says Check your wallet carefully. If dfa Hashflow protocol been used, prevent the wallet from being attacked
undefined says Are there 421613 nodes that support hardhat publishing contracts and validating contracts? The nodes I'm looking for now are always saying that the function sendTransaction is not supported
undefined says 
undefined says I'm on a test network
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Yes but I can't find a more detailed explanation for some things. I’m trying to understand the refund mechanism from the data available from RPCs. 
When a retryable is submitted, several internal transactions are produced. Some of them are value transfers to the L2 Surplus Fee and some to the feeRefundAddress. 
However, when I check the actual balance change for both addresses using an RPC there is a discrepancy. In fact,  the difference between the real balance change and the sum of the values received by the internal txs is the same for both addresses but with opposite sign, so it seems there is a missing internal tx from the surplus and the fee Refund. Could you help me understand what I might be missing?

I’m trying to send an example but I get a warning for repeating the text…
undefined says We use Brotli compression algorithm within our codebase.
undefined says You might be able to do so using the `gasleft`. This looks like a good reference:
https://www.rareskills.io/post/solidity-gasleft
undefined says We provide all the breaking changes that happened after the Nitro migration, including the gas accounting. I'd recommend you go through this list:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/migration/dapp_migration
undefined says Hey, can you provide your L1 tx hash? You could also dm me if that feels more comfortable.
undefined says I got this warning message from my running node "Caller gas above allowance, capping" quite often. Is it OK ? Ty
undefined says This error has something to do with your code and it's not related to the node. One thing that comes to mind is you might be formatting your tx object wrong.
undefined says I have some questions I still do not understand after reading the Arbitrum docs and the whitepaper, hope someone from the core team could help on this.
undefined says 1. How does the Arbitrum protocol use the `calldata` of each batch that was posted to L1 to do fraud proving and dispute resolution?
undefined says 2. How do Arbitrum nodes retrieve the `calldata` from the execution layer node's (e.g `Geth`) DB?
undefined says 3. If there is a fraud dispute, where is the final state recorded and posted to L1 after the challenge period?
undefined says done
undefined says Good
undefined says As you mentioned yourself, every L1-L2 message creates various internal transactions to move funds around. We have recently updated our docs which provide useful information of how/why these funds are moved around:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging
undefined says There 's a max gas gap set on our node which I *believe* is same as geth; 50000000.
You might be able to configure your node using this flag:
--node.rpc.gas-cap
undefined says Responded ser :arbiblobblue:
undefined says 
undefined says In that case, do rblocks get broadcasted? Since validators have to see the blocks to challenge them or stake them

Also, do rblocks correspond to the blocks show in the explorer arbiscan.io/blocks ?
undefined says Validators make RBlocks on L1 via the rollup contract. RBlocks are a large collection of L2 blocks.
undefined says Thank you. So what do the blocks represent in arbiscan? Since L2 blocks are built locally and not subjected to p2p?
undefined says Those are the L2 blocks
undefined says every L2 node builds the same blocks
undefined says Is customer service available?
undefined says We have a dedicated customer #📬︱support channel available where you can ask your queries. Please feel free to use that channel for any assistance you need.
undefined says dev issues, just on this channel. other questions you can post in #📬︱support
undefined says If the #📬︱support  channel is down, you can ask for help in #💬︱general
undefined says We are always here to help
undefined says 
undefined says Hey, do you guys have any idea of an on-chain random number generation on arbitrum? (without using chainlink vrf, in 1tx)

which means nobody should be able to make add transaction they want at the certain block generation
undefined says Please be patient and wait for a team member to help
undefined says Any workaround if goerli arb is again not allowing one to deploy stuff?
undefined says Or can i locally increase gas to a certain amount in my hardhat?
undefined says Keep getting this. in the past it resolved itself often after a few days; i suspect thats due to gas. Trying to deploy a basic contract
undefined says Is Arbitrum Goerli the testnet for both One and Nova? And is there an official faucet?
undefined says If for testing purposes, you can deploy the contract  on ur local server.
undefined says Is it possible to wrap an Arbitrum-based NFT and migrate it to mainnet?
undefined says The testnet is goerli, you can get ETH on goerli's faucet
undefined says Ok awesome ty. It wasn’t as intuitive as I thought it would be, but I was able to get it to work by using the faucet on Ethereum Goerli, then bridging it over to Arbitrum Goerli using Arbitrum’s bridge. The part that was confusing to me is that I didn’t see an option to bridge this way unless I was already connected to Ethereum Goerli
undefined says Just wanted to include that context in case it helps someone else in the future 🙂
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says You can change to another rpc provider and try: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says Our bridge doesn’t support nft bridge now, but you can implement yourself.
undefined says Use on chain precompile or opcode are not safe way to generate random number, so I don’t think there is a reliable way but use vrf or qrng.
undefined says Can anyone send me some Arbitrum Goerli please 🙏
0x71B43a66324C7b80468F1eE676E7FCDaF63eB6Ac
undefined says 
undefined says I couldnt claim from those faucets
undefined says faucet.paradigm.xyz
goerli-faucet.pk910.de
undefined says You can get some in goerli faucet
undefined says These faucets don't work
undefined says The second one should work, you need to mine
undefined says It got depleted man.. They never give you ETH even after hours
I have tried it
undefined says Maybe you need to wait for other members to help you. Or buy goerli eth in some dex by using real ETH  DYOR
undefined says Arbiscan reads this data from a RPC endpoint of the Arbitrum full-node. How is L2block formed (How do validators get this L2block data)? What is the correlation between "sequencer's batch" submitted to L1 smart contract and "L2block"? @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs
undefined says Sequencer will feed messages to other full node, and each message’s tx is a single l2 block’s tx, the sequencer batch is a batch of those l2 messages, you can see here how to decode a sequencer batch message to blocks and txns: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/blob/main/packages/batch-tx-handler/README.md#l1-batch-handler
undefined says Hey,
Do you have some more docs regarding address aliasing ? How can I deploy an L2 contract whose address is the alias of an L1 contract I own ?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says But how L1 stores the information it got about L2?
undefined says Have you seen https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
Unfortunately there’s no way to create a contract with the aliased add on L2
This may help you but: you have control over l2 aliased address with your l1 contract address.
If you can send arbitrary messages with your L1 contract, then you can call our bridge to send L1 to L2 message and control the l2 side
undefined says batch poster and validator are sending these info to L1
undefined says Oh interesting! It works in this way in both directions Arbitrum <- -> Ethereum?

I mean if on L2 I want some information about L1 state, batch poster and validator can send this information to L2 (working in fact just as a third party)? 

How it will be stored on L2 then? Just as a part of the Merkle Tree?
undefined says Oh no! Batch poster and validator just send some specific data from L1 to L2 and vice versa
undefined says Generally if you want some data of L1 and L2 on the other side, you need to send a message between them
undefined says If you want L1 data on L2, you need to have a contract on L1, which initiates an L1 to L2 message using our bridge contracts, and it’ll take like 15 mins to receive that message on L2
undefined says If you need L2 state on L1, you need to create an L2 to L1 message using our Arbsys precompile. But it’ll take around 7 days because of dispute period
undefined says More info:

undefined says 
undefined says does anyone know what INVALID trace type means?
i found INVALID mentioned in the sourcecode but it did't clarify anything for me even a little:(
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says That's for Arbitrum precompile actions which aren't part of the EVM
undefined says IIRC they specifically denote balance transfers which don't trigger an EVM call
undefined says Hey guys. I'm looking to aiordrop our porject Tokens to ARB stakers. What tools are available and easiest for those with not a ton of dev experience? Thank you!
undefined says Sorry, this channel is a dev side issue. If it is DAO, you can communicate more in #deleted-channel
undefined says sorry brother
undefined says does anyone know how to withdraw the arb token on ledger?
thank you in advance
undefined says To withdraw the ARB token from your Ledger device, you'll need to follow a few steps. First, ensure that your Ledger device is connected and that you have the Ledger Live software installed on your computer. Open Ledger Live and navigate to the ARB token in the app's portfolio section. 

Click on the ARB token and select the "Send" option. Enter the recipient's wallet address, specify the amount of ARB you want to withdraw, and review the transaction details. Finally, confirm the transaction on your Ledger device by verifying the transaction details displayed on the device's screen. Once confirmed, the ARB tokens will be sent to the specified recipient address.
undefined says what networks to send arb to ledger? on the network of arbitrum or arbitrum (eth)
undefined says Do you want to send your tokens to a Ledger wallet or withdraw from a Ledger?
undefined says Send to e ledger
undefined says Hey mate, Leger has recently added support for the Arbitrum token and Arbitrum chain. So, if you're planning to deposit using the Arbitrum chain, it is supported. However, I recommend double-checking before making any transfers.
undefined says Thank you.
as we are already writing, I have one more question, for some networks to send the RDNT token to the ledger? Is such a transaction possible? Thank you
undefined says Ledger supports 100 tokens on the Arbitrum blockchain, directly through Ledger Live.
undefined says You can find more details on the ledger live app
undefined says on the ledger website I can't find anything about rdnt, whether it can be sent over the arbitrum network or not.
undefined says Hey mate, I just checked the Ledger website and it states that RDNT is not supported. I'm not sure if the information is outdated.
undefined says Is that you?
undefined says I dont Think so
undefined says Scammmer, Please block and Report
undefined says Do not engage with random DMs or click on any links, as they may attempt to deceive you with phishing scams in order to steal your money.
undefined says Ok
undefined says is the best option to send to mm and secure with a ledger?
undefined says I don't use a ledger, so I'm unable to assist you. Let's wait for the admins; they will be able to help you.
undefined says Hey @izdepa#0 , I just checked it with my friend, and he says it supports Ledger. But ledger live doesn't support rdnt
undefined says Thank you
undefined says You're welcome
undefined says Wow
undefined says Helloo, everyone! This chat is specifically designed for developers and protocol discussions. For regular issues and inquiries, please utilize the #📬︱support channel.
undefined says In the delayedInbox, why is calculateRetryableSubmissionFee, is the L1 basefee used as a proxy to estimate an upperbound for the L2 basefee and in reality the L2 basefee is charged, or is the L1 basefee really the gas unit for the submission fee? I'd assume arbos uses l2 basefee to calculate the submission fee.

undefined says Arbiscan limits me to the download of up to 100,000 holders' information

I need the information from all 599,896 holders, and I can't seem to find a way to download it

Can anyone assist me?
undefined says We do use l1 base fee as it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbos/retryables/retryable.go#L369
undefined says Is there some endpoint I can use?
undefined says This might be etherscan team’s limit, but you can try use dune or rpc api to calculate this.
undefined says How would I go around using the API of an RPC? If you have the time to elaborate

Thanks in advance btw
undefined says Oh, just found chainbase has this api: https://docs.chainbase.com/docs/how-to-get-the-holders-of-an-erc20-token
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says I see it gives you all token holders, but is there a function to give how much ARB they hold?
undefined says @galha Are you there ?
undefined says Yeah
undefined says These are all the token api endpoints by use case:
https://docs.chainbase.com/reference/token-api-overview#token-api-endpoints-by-use-case
So I suppose they dont. But once you have account address you are able to check the balance via the  `balanceOf()`:
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548#readProxyContract#F6

undefined says Is there a way to use the Arbitrum bridge for bridging tokens originally deployed to Arbitrum? We deployed our token to Arbitrum, and now we're trying to bridge it from Arbitrum to Ethereum. I can see that the bridge calls a `l1Address()` on the contract (which doesn't exist because it wasn't bridged from Ethereum to Arbitrum). Are there any workarounds?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Thanks for helping me with this. I did some more reading and I have a question. Question. If the token is already launched and we have not included the IArbToken object for our token, is it too late to bridge to eth mainnet? Looks like we should have followed this and made sure our token is a IArbToken type. Is there any other way around it? Could you please suggest. Thank you
undefined says We are investigating the reverse bridge but now we don’t have deployed a permissionless one yet, this is our reverse gateway contract: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ReverseCustomGateway.sol
undefined says You should implement it or the bridge can’t bridge and mint the token on the target side.
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs/anyone, I am confused by two variables in the outboundTransferCustomRefund function of teh L1 Gateway Router contract. Are you able to lend me a hand? Thank you
undefined says I'm not sure what to submit for the _data (bytes) variable, nor payableAmount (ether).
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says I believe you can find those param and how to get those param here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/assetBridger/erc20Bridger.ts#LL540C13-L540C22
undefined says Reading through this, correct me if I'm wrong, the cross chain message passing is handled by the Arbitrum protocol itself and no oracles are needed? There needs to also exist a "counterpart" on L1 for this to work. Is there an ETA for the official reverse bridge?
undefined says No oracles need, we will process it in our protocol directly, currently we don’t have eta for that, sorry about this.
undefined says Is the underlying protocol implemented, and it's only the bridge and its UI that isn't officially released, or does the protocol also need some work? Are the contracts final or are they going to be updated?
undefined says PR#33 needs some love 👀
undefined says I can't vote on a snapshot!!! I voted on Tally without any problems. I delegated the tokens to myself in advance, there is some kind of general problem, that's for sure. please analyze these appeals in more detail, I looked at the history, many have such a problem, and it is not as unrelated to the fact that they did delegation before with nimka, this is not at all the case.
it says there are no tokens , although in fact they are on the tally I have already voted , and on the Tally website in the delegation section it is written that you have already delegated yourself, I think that if I hadn't delegated or something else, then I wouldn't be able to participate in delegation on the Tally site, there may be a problem from the side of the snapshot platform itself, the balance can not be properly tightened
undefined says I voted on tally without any problems
undefined says Do not interact with this user, He is impersonating admin
undefined says @Ana 💙 Arbitrum ban this scammmer 🙂
undefined says thanks for the warning
undefined says You're welcome! Please be patient and wait for official admins to assist you here.
undefined says If you receive any unsolicited direct messages claiming to offer help, be cautious as it may be a scam.
undefined says If you mean the general bridge, we have explains here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/for-devs/cross-chain-messsaging , for reverse gateway, yes, we need some more works so haven’t released a public one yet.
undefined says Could you ask this in #deleted-channel ?
undefined says Fascinating. I'm going to try and make a two-way bridge out of this.
undefined says Yes, cool, you can made them through our retryables system and gateway system, hope they can help!
undefined says I apologize, Jason. I'm aware that this may not be the appropriate channel for such questions, but we cannot disregard the user's issue. Since our support is currently unavailable, I believed that this chat would be the most suitable platform for the user to receive an answer from our official developers.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I have read a post in medium, it mentioned a coming protocol 3 for solving delay attack. Shall I ask that where I can find more details of this protocol?
undefined says 
undefined says You might also want to ask Snapshot directly, if you think there's a problem on their end. Hope it gets resolved.
undefined says 
undefined says I know that a single RBlock contains multiple Batches, and a single Batch contains multiple L2 Blocks. In outbox's roots mapping, this roothash refers to the merkle tree hash of the submitted RBlock, and which block does this blockhash refer to? At first I thought the blockhash was the hash of the last L2 Block of the last Batch of the submitted RBlock, but I looked at the log today and found that this idea was wrong.
undefined says There hasn't been any further announcement about it, but it's still being implemented.
undefined says It's the blockhash of the latest L2 block that's been processed to obtain that root.
undefined says whats the fastest way to send a transaction to the sequencer please ? when there are a lot of messsages taking place it takes 4-5 seconds to get a transaction submitted. Is it possible to send txn directly to the sequencer rather than vie rpc node please ?
undefined says All transactions have to be sent to the node, with the exception of eth_sendRawTransaction , which the node forwards to the Sequencer, so you can send those directly to the Sequencer at https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/ (note that only eth_sendRawTransaction are accepted in that endpoint, and failing tx are rate limited)
undefined says Thank you. This just means it’s too late if we already launched a token without using the bridge token right? Any way around it? Like a wrapped token ? Any advice will be appreciated. Thank you
undefined says 
undefined says Hey @NoaLatam s , unfortunately, posting links is not allowed here due to bad actors. You can ask your questions without including any links.
undefined says , I'm trying to run an arbitrum node in ubuntu, yes or if you have to download the image db.tar?
undefined says Hey! 
So first of all, you're going to need a custom reverse gateway, like my colleagues mentioned you, as the one setup for the ARB token is exclusive for that token. You can use it as a reference for your own gateway though:
- L2 reverse gateway => https://arbiscan.io/address/0xCaD7828a19b363A2B44717AFB1786B5196974D8E
- L1 reverse gateway => https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbcE8aA77782F13D4202a230d978F361B011dB27

I think having a custom gateway will allow you to circumvent the need of conforming to the ReverseArbToken.sol (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/ReverseArbToken.sol), but I can't guarantee it 100%. In case you need to conform to that interface, you can always have a wrapped version of your token that implements it.

You can then deploy the L1 version of your token (that should implement a bridgeMint and a bridgeBurn method, like IArbToken, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol )  and register it through the router and gateway to have them linked.

We don't have implementations for this other than the ARB token, so we lack some experience in reverse bridging, but we are happy to assist you in case you run into any issues while implementing it.

Finally, we would like to know your use case for having a reverse bridging process, so if you can DM me or any of my colleagues with information about what problem you're trying to solve with it, or what scenarios you're looking to develop, we'd very thankful 💪

undefined says I'm not sure if you can do this here. You can try tweeting about it using the hashtags related to DAO, and you might receive some responses.
undefined says Good luck mate 💙
undefined says 
undefined says I dont get any response from the sequencer when I do eth_sendRawTransaction. For any message I send I get no response
undefined says When incentivized public validators guys?  Been asking for over a year now. Any plans ever to properly decentralize the network or it's just going to be the inner circle for the foreseeable future   ..?
undefined says Do we get reward in arb for running a fullnode ?
undefined says the chain is definitely running, you'll have to provide more details of the specific HTTP error code or whatever you're receiving to troubleshoot
undefined says we are definitely working hard to get permissionless validators out; we have some upcoming changes that will help facilitate this. However, I don't know that incentives will ever be considered. If they are, it would have to be discussed and voted on by the DAO governance
undefined says no, there is no reward for running a node
undefined says it was my bad. incorrect url lol. thanks response
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs Hey ChrisCo, would you please help to clarify one of my confusion?
undefined says Let me take a case as example:
**Case **-  i open the arbed uniswap list and bridge a uniswap token (e.g. a dapp token called ABC) from ethereum to arbitrum, then days later the dapp developers deploy token ABC  again on arbitrum.

**Quesiton** - Which one should be regared as the official one? Will my bridged ABC automatically migrated to the officially deployed ABC?
undefined says When i deposit  ABC again from Ethereum, will the former mapped ABC token on arbitrum be replaced by the ABC deployed by the dapp developers?
undefined says had same issue but was able to fix it \
undefined says How did you fix that bro?
undefined says Is there a way to download Arbitrum snaphosts/archives using bittorrent ? Arb Foundation servers are really slow to deliver 3TB of data
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Hey, could you help to answer my question?
undefined says If I initially use the standard gateway to bridge a L1 token 'ABC' to Arbitrum, then I'll  get a standard ABC on Arbi.
Maybe days Later, due to business needs, an upgradeable custom ABC is depolyed on Arbitrum. Can I then bind the L1 ABC and the Arbitrum custom ABC through the L1CustomGateway Contract?

If so, wouldn't the unique L1 ABC corresponds to two ABC tokens on Arbitrum?
undefined says Hey mate, they are in a different timezone. They will reply to you as soon as they are available.
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum @Ana 💙 Arbitrum @hunter | Offchain Labs spam , please delete 👀
undefined says Man I see you handling the community chats hella well. Even though I just joined, thanks for contributing
undefined says Thanks for the feedback! I've been working hard to make the community a welcoming and informative space for everyone
undefined says 100% keep up the good work 🙂
undefined says 💙🙏🏽
undefined says Assuming the token has been never bridged before and you’re the first one doing that, you can do so using our bridge. What happens next is the bridge deploys and registers a counterpart token contract on L2 automatically. Hereafter, anyone can deposit and withdraw their tokens between L1 and L2 safely via Arbitrum token bridge. 
Deploying the same token manually on L2 doesn’t touch the officially bridged one. In this case, that token will be only withdrawable to L1. Here’s the list we maintain for these tokens (note that there might be some L2 tokens missing): https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arb-token-bridge/blob/master/packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/src/util/WithdrawOnlyUtils.ts
I'd suggest going through the token bridging section of our docs, it clears things up a lot for you:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-overview
undefined says Yep, actually i've read the whole doc, but still can't find an answer dismiss my confusion
undefined says ' Deploying the same token manually on L2 doesn’t touch the officially bridged one. In this case, that token will be only withdrawable to L1 '
-------------------------------------------
Both the mannually deployed custom token and the standard token will be withdrawn to be the same L1 token, right?
undefined says Yes, both can be withdrwan to L1.
undefined says Thank you so much for your help Mahsa! 
So in a nutshell, an L1 token can be mapped to two tokens on Arbitrum at the same time, standard token/custom token, but when both exist at the same time, only the standard token supports both deposit and withdrawal, and the custom token is only withdrawable.
undefined says Of course! Almost yes,
Although if a project decides they want the L2 counterpart to be their official one, they can  go through the process of registering their custom L2 token on our bridge. If done, the L1 token will have 2 counterpart tokens on L2, but only your new custom L2 token will be minted when depositing tokens from L1 (L1-to-L2 bridging). Both L2 tokens will be withdrawable (L2-to-L1 bridging), so users holding the old standard ERC20 token (the one that was originally minted by the bridge) will be able to withdraw back to L1 and then deposit to L2 to get the new custom L2 tokens.
undefined says 👍👍 got it
undefined says Is there a tool to help recover funds in the case arbitrum goes down permanently? Or is there any documentation on how to force withdraw? Does this only apply to ETH balances or to all tokens?
undefined says Create ticket and ask the support team https://discord.com/channels/1109380932365996072/1120361195354984509/1120373744112762980
undefined says How can I see how many times the arbitrum network has been down?
undefined says To date, Arbitrum has only gone down twice. The team has worked to improve the stability of the network and hopes to avoid any further downtime in the future.
undefined says Where can I see that data? Is there some chart that shows the downtimes?
undefined says And I read somewhere that two weeks ago Arbitrum had a sequencer problem and went down. Is that one of those two times?
undefined says The first downtime happened in September 2021,
undefined says Is there some chart where I can see the uptime of arbitrum?
undefined says Hey, that was a disruption in the Arbitrum batch poster that caused batches not to be posted. The Sequencer was not affected or disrupted and continued to process transactions throughout.
You can find more details here:
https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs/status/1666549893001887744?s=20
undefined says Anyone can submit any tx (including their withdrawals) themselves by putting them into the "delayed inbox" queue, which is managed by an L1 Ethereum contract. If the Sequencer goes down and cannot submit any batches for a long period (longer than a maximum delay interval (currently 24 hours)) then anyone can force those messages to be promoted into the main inbox to be further executed by the nodes.
undefined says How can I do this without being a developer? Also is there docs on how to do this?
undefined says Yes ser, you can read about it here:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job
undefined says Is the sequencer inbox an upgradeable contract? These docs don't really go into any detail on how to do this. I suppose I'll have to look to the unit tests for a more clear example.
undefined says We have a tutorial script that helps anyone with a minimum dev experience to do that :
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg
undefined says It is an upgradeable contract... who has control over this?
undefined says And yes the contract is upgradeable, you can see our nitro contracts here:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/tree/main
undefined says It would be in the hands of the DAO
undefined says What address is the proxy admin?
undefined says Here is the list of our smart contracts addresses, you can find details through the list:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/for-devs/useful-addresses#core--contracts
undefined says ? 554723262467F125Ac9e1cDFa9Ce15cc53822dbD
undefined says yeap:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x554723262467F125Ac9e1cDFa9Ce15cc53822dbD
undefined says The owner of that is another upgradeable proxy 86f0cf42ad673b3d666d103e009ec142d1298a17 who has admin roll for this?
undefined says Or more simply is it Offchain doing what the DAO says or does the DAO have direct control?
undefined says 3ffFbAdAF827559da092217e474760E2b2c3CeDd is the admin which is the contract itself.
undefined says 3666a60ff589873ced457a9a8a0aA6F83D708767
undefined says Dao have direct control
undefined says I can't even talk in this thing
undefined says 0x3ffFbAdAF827559da092217e474760E2b2c3CeDd is the Upgrade Executor controlled directly by the governance
undefined says Basically everything is controlled by the dao, offchain controls nothing
undefined says https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md#l1-upgrade-executor
undefined says this is the main executor which is a gnosis safe 3666a60ff589873ced457a9a8a0aA6F83D708767
undefined says 0x3666a60ff589873ced457a9a8a0aA6F83D708767 is the Security Council address
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/gentle-intro-dao-governance#how-does-arbitrums-governance-work
undefined says Ok cool I agree then it's controlled by these 12 people which are elected by the DAO. So not the DAO directly.
undefined says no
undefined says The Dao also control the upgrade executor directly
undefined says how
undefined says If you want to understand more details, there's a lot of low level documentation available about how the system is structured https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md
undefined says 
undefined says Particularly there's a really large system diagram in there that shows how the pieces are all connected along with a lot of written description
undefined says "The 9/12 Security Council should be able to make an upgrade without any delay." So the 9/12 has the ultimate power and in my view is the weakest link. If the 9/12 is compromised then system integrity is in jeopardy. Perhaps a DAO proposal to make the inbox a non-upgradeable contract should be considered. I'm assuming it was done upgradeable for security and upgradeability purposes.
undefined says That certainly have its trade-off, tho we tried to mitigate that with a diverse group of initial Security Council members, and will be elected regularly
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-1-arbitrum-improvement-proposal-framework/30
undefined says "make the inbox a non-upgradeable" does not really solve what you want to solve as long as any part of the system can be upgraded
undefined says What else would need to be non-upgradeable? If the L1 calldata is there wouldn't this be the only contract you'd need to call?
undefined says for example, the rollup contract can be upgraded to read from another inbox
undefined says even if you have the data onchain, you still need the rollup and the fraud proof to properly read that input data
undefined says Ok so they could be non upgradeable as well. Are there any serious adverse implications of doing that?
undefined says The technology is still new and may contain bug, just like having a Security Council it help to address critical risks associated with the Arbitrum protocol and its ecosystem.
undefined says Generally speaking, the adverse implication of having everything be non-upgradable is that it would be impossible to fix any bugs
undefined says Definitely a very known risk tradeoff that the DAO will evaluate over time
undefined says Since the DAO could remove the security council if it wanted (assuming the security council didn't become actively malicious and stop it)
undefined says Yes but on a delay which would be post anything bad they did.

None of the security council are gnosis safes so I would assume the majority are MPC/hardware. If bitgo/fireblocks were compromised this itself could lead to a total loss of funds.
undefined says But anyway this has been very helpful I don't want to take up any more of your time. I understand the tradeoffs and I hope the DAO considers further decentralization in the future.
undefined says Actually one more, why is it only whitelisted actors that can submit fraud proofs versus the longer INT approach?
undefined says In terms of whitelisting the reason is https://research.arbitrum.io/t/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups/692. A new protocol is being developed that can be used to hopefully eliminate that restriction
undefined says And fully with you on the risks, definitely a good convo to have. Btw just on the delay thing, the issue there is basically
1) Most of the time the bug is clear from the fix
2) You could hide the fix while having a delay, but then you don't have a way for people to verify the change so it doesn't help much
undefined says I have a question, could anyone help?
I am running offchain tasks on arbitrum goerli.
main task is getting past events from specific block to recent block, but nowadays some events that included in most recent blocks are missing when I tried to get events as soon as block generated.
this recent block number is also derived from node. and I can get events when trying after a white.
this is rpc node sync error? does anyone have same experience with me?
undefined says Try using a different RPC node. Increase the node's polling interval.
undefined says is this issue resolved ser? having the same issues on my end. I voted on tally already but not able to vote on snapshot
undefined says The snapshot may have been taken before you delegated your tokens
undefined says 
undefined says I have sent some USDC from exchange to arbitrum one, I can see the money in my metamask wallet, but it can't be sent and can't show in the defi plateforms, pls someone help me, Thanks
undefined says 0xc8dfbadc02019aeb6e414d4e9fceb8fe237fdaa37519507874c34642ebafb03c
undefined says Helloo there, you need to have ETH in your Arbitrum wallet in order to process transactions.
undefined says I just checked your wallet, and I see that you don't have enough ETH to make a transaction.
undefined says yeah i saw it, but when i use 1 inch and layersway trying to swap usdc-eth, they all show insufficient balance which i have enough usdc in my wallet
undefined says When you swap tokens on a DEX, you need to pay a gas fee to the miners who process the transaction. **This fee is paid in ETH**, so if you don't have enough ETH in your wallet, you won't be able to swap your tokens.
undefined says 
undefined says I'm trying to run a node on Arbitrum Nitro from Ubuntu, and after running the following command:

docker run --rm -it -v home/user/.arbitrum -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834 --l1.url=https:// arb1.arbitrum .io /rpc --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url="file:///path/to/snapshot/in/container/nitro.tar" --ws.port=8548 --ws.address=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*

I'm getting the following error: Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --ws.address

Can you please help me and tell me what I'm doing wrong?
undefined says Hey could someone please send me some AGOR? I tried to go on the testnet faucet on QuickNode but the website isn't working for me.

If you could be so kind, I would appreciate it!
undefined says No worries, the website now works!
undefined says Let me know if you need more , i have some in my wallet
undefined says would any1 mind explaining me the most practical way of accessing entire gasleft() data  or gasspent or smth like that in solidity?
currently gasleft() does not reflect the L1 fees, which makes it impossible for me to keep track of the entire gas spent in a function execution
undefined says The ArbGasInfo precompile has a getCurrentTxL1GasFees method
undefined says How does that help here though? is the poster cost of any arbi TX fixed?
undefined says (also in that case, that means that this method is highly inaccurate as it returns ~0.000022 ETH whilst my txns keep getting around a ~0.000015-16 poster fee)?
undefined says I meant calling it in the txn but I'm not sure on your usecase
undefined says is it different if i call it directly in my transaction?
undefined says yeah it's different per tx, it returns the amount of poster fees charged to that specific tx
undefined says i.e, initiating a function call and having it call ``getCurrentTxL1GasFees()`` returns the exact amount that goes towards poster fees by the initiator of the transaction? is it like gasleft() where it depends on the location of it within the execution, or will i get the same result querying it in the beggining & in the end of the execution?
undefined says the latter, it's tx level not call level
undefined says a specific call doesn't have a poster fee associated with it (I'm not really sure what that'd mean)
undefined says it's like tx.origin, it's tx level
undefined says basically, i just want to make a function which refunds the gas paid by the initiator. On L1s it's simple as adding a ``gasfree`` modifer which tracks the gasleft in the beggining and the end.

and yes i understand poster fee is tx level,  but i thought maybe it was based some call level stuff, my bad. LEt me try it out quickly
undefined says well on L1 that actually ignores the intrinsic cost too, so you're missing out there
undefined says are you refering to the base fee?
undefined says nope
undefined says intrinsic cost is 21k per tx + 4 gas per zero byte of calldata + 16 gas per nonzero byte of calldata + some other misc charges e.g. when creating a contract iirc
undefined says the ethereum yellow paper documents this
undefined says https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf
undefined says but it sounds like for your use case, gasleft + getCurrentTxL1GasFees will get you close enough to perfect on L2, assuming that gasleft gets you close enough to perfect on L1
undefined says is that disabled on Arbi and replaced by currentTxL1GasFees?
undefined says or am i supposed to do ``gasleft + intrinsticCost`` on L1 & then ``gasleft + intrinsticCost + getCurrentTxL1GasFees`` on arbi?
undefined says The latter
undefined says but likely the intrinsic gas will be small enough to ignore in your use case
undefined says yeap that makes sense, also in my usecase the gas is repaid for multiple calls within a txn seperately, so it would spread nicely amongst all of them
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs  , so how accurate is. the l1txfees eaxctly? i'm getting 0.000022+ ETH result now whilst the poster fee on arbiscsan is ~0.000018 ETH. getCurrentTxL1GasFees only refers to Poster fee, correct? The result is closer to the total gas paid in the txn than the poster fee.
undefined says actually, nvm.i think it's my bad here!
undefined says seems perfect when i emit it instead of simulating return data. tysm for ur help Lee!
undefined says Why the block gas limit is set to 30m, is there any particular reason to do that?
undefined says Am I right in thinking that `to` address in the call gets rolled down to L1, thefore having more zeros in callee would bring the L1 fees down as well?
undefined says yo guys, i got a question: if i were to launch my own crypto (designed for eth mainnet/erc20 and BSC/BEP20), would the exact same code be applicable for ARB and ZkSync network?
undefined says Currently 16 gas per byte for non-zero calldata, 4 gas per byte for zero calldata, but you need to make sure those zero are in the same byte, if so, yes it will be cheaper.
undefined says You can use the same code on arbitrum and ethereum, I am not sure about zksync.
undefined says Ethereum’s block limit is 30m, arbitrum is 32m, this is to make sure network have enough resource to execution.
undefined says I need about 40m to do my transaction, that's too bad. 😦
undefined says Why does the gas limit of the arbitrum chain fluctuate with the same contract function, and the fluctuation is very large, which makes it difficult for me to link the data up
undefined says On arbitrum, for example, when it used to only consume 7 million gas limits, but now the data volume has decreased, the same contract function requires 20 million gas limits. I don't understand why, can anyone help me explain?
undefined says Answered at #🇨🇳︱中文技术频道

undefined says 
undefined says Hey guys, I have a few questions.

So I understand that the ERC20 token in L1, when bridging, L2 version is created automatically. How does the L2 version look like? Is it a simple transferable ERC20 token?

My current ERC20 token has a lot of extra functionality and talks with a few of my dApp's contracts. Maybe I should deploy my ERC20 token and all the other dApp contracts to L2 instead and reverse bridge to L1? That would make a simple transferable only version in L1 and I'll keep all the extra funcionality in L2 correct?

Thanks in advance!
undefined says Hey,
1. Yeah we deploy the openzepplin standard ERC20 token contract.
2. You can also develop your custom gateway to support the connection between your L1 and L2 token. Please read this:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-custom-gateway
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain LabsDoes arbitrum orbit use arbitrum's common sequencer or does its own chain have its own sequencer
undefined says I'm assuming that Arbitrum Orbit uses its own sequencer. The Arbitrum common sequencer is not used for Orbit chains. This is because Orbit chains are designed to be more modular and flexible than Arbitrum One, and having their own sequencer gives them more control over their own security and performance.

However, I'm not 100% sure about this. Iets  wait for the admins to confirm.

You can use the #👷︱orbit-support for such queries
undefined says you can also check in #👷︱orbit-support
undefined says thanks
undefined says Happy to help
undefined says 5 days ago I applied for the arbitrum portal, but I still have not received an answer (
Let me remind you that I was told by partnerships@offchainlabs.com that I need to audit the smart contract. I did it! hooray! Inspired by this event, I applied again and have been waiting for a response for 5 days. I would be very grateful if you could help me solve this issue.
undefined says please wait team is working on the backlog, give more time to answer. What is the company name I'll try escalating if you wish
undefined says project headortail  Thank you
undefined says What's your website i am unable to find it?

here is a link where you can find all info about my problem
undefined says Do you guys have your bridge UI open sourced? Would make my life easier because I would like to implement it on my own dApp using your contracts if possible. For better UX and specially for new users to use.
undefined says I think it should be open source, or you can find more on arbitrum github first
undefined says Yes, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge
undefined says Hey, I don’t see your audit url in your application, you should upload that too.
undefined says 
undefined says Can you share with me your audit url link?
undefined says 
undefined says I can't send a link here. Write to you in private messages?
undefined says guys?
undefined says I have sent you links in private messages
undefined says Thanks for the help 👌
undefined says In order to avoid a large number of scam links, team members banned members from posting links
undefined says You can try to use another way such as  `github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge`
undefined says which functions should i call to bridge an ERC20 from a smart contract on Ethereum to Arbitrum one on your official bridge ?
Should i call the "outboundTransfer" function from the bridge on my smart contract or is there an easier function to call ?
undefined says @roo I also am the head of 2 BD of 2 protocols - one is already releasing news soon of backing and will be on arbitrum, would love to push ours as well. We already sent to Ana.
undefined says ok, I sent all the links in private messages @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says Please tag Ana with your project details, She will check it
undefined says Yeah I have kinda went dead for awhile now :/ didn’t want to ping her anymore as she’s probably too busy and understandable so. 

But I pinged her twice and sent all info for the past week already, in hopes to hear back 

/ but I’m also trying to push another protocol as well which is already on testnet and will go mainnet in a few weeks.
undefined says are you familiar with https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging
undefined says It is also possible, please wait patiently for Jason's reply
undefined says on the outBoundtransfer function to bridge from ethereum to Arbitrum on, there is a bytes _data param like this :
undefined says what should i put to this _data parameter ? can't find it on the doc
undefined says thanks for sharing details please check earlier conversation: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1092962142539493497
undefined says also check: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/cb71d640d233b0362591f62fac9bf951b733eecd/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L229
The outboundTransfer is payable, you need to send some ETH along w it to cover the L2 side of the tx's execution.
undefined says look like he didn't get the answer ?
undefined says @kayolord are you somewhere here ? :arbiblobblue:
undefined says thats what i'am digging in, but can't find any doc about the _data parameter
undefined says We have a tutorial to show how you can process the tx through our bridge: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit
undefined says The data field should abi encode (uint maxSubmissionCost, bytes)
usually that should be an empty bytes
undefined says thanks for that ! did you find these information somewhere ?
undefined says cause i see on barely each bridge transaction that this parameter is never empty
undefined says yes it's been shared by the team please try and let us know
undefined says thanks ! will try it on goerli and i come back to you
undefined says You can also use Arbitrum's SDK to easily bridge your tokens programmatically. In this page you can find how the process is done step by step (from Steps 2-5) => https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-standard#step-2-identify-the-bridge-contracts-to-call-concepts-summary

If you want to call the contract directly, without the SDK, you should call the function outboundTransferCustomRefund in the L1GatewayRouter => https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef#writeProxyContract#F4
(You can also call outboundTransfer, but the "customRefund" version allows you to specify a different address to refund excess gas).
undefined says we need to do a proposal from Tally (from our DAO) to bridge our token, forget to mention that
undefined says just tried the proposal with the bridge tx, will update you if it works or not on goerli
undefined says @Ana 💙 Arbitrum  Hey Ana! This is Jason, I know. im pinging you like crazy. I sent our protocols info 6 days ago and didn't include the audit. I would like to add that as well. Could we follow up?
undefined says Sure
undefined says Where did you send to? Apply portal?
undefined says i sent it to partnerships@offchainlabs.com as per what Ana told me to do dos also she confirmed it was received as well. Appreciate what she has done for me as well!
undefined says I sent, please check)

undefined says Sounds good. I can send the audit. Ill send another email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says done! just resent
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hey there @roo 
Kindly check my DM! Appreciate it
undefined says please try not to DM 🙏 better write in #📬︱support channel or open a ticket
undefined says Sure, thank you for sharing!
undefined says 
undefined says What's the latest evm version supported by Arbitrum, London? Paris? (I know is not Shangai)
undefined says @Ana 💙 Arbitrum  Any updates? I already sent in the audit as well. Sorry for not putting it together in the first place as I didn't know.
undefined says we have a fork of Geth as our execution EVM inside Arbitrum, the latest changes can be tracked on the repo (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro); there are some minor differences between EVM JSON-RPC protocol and Arb's marked here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences
undefined says you'll have to be patient, the team cannot respond to all requests right away
undefined says I agree and I understand. I am sure everyone else also has been waiting for over a week and I'm fine waiting longer. if it's okay to ask for a tentative timeframe for these things, then i can always come back after that period has passed. If that information can be disclosed.
undefined says Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. The team gets hundreds of requests and it's not always straightforward to evaluate or give a timeline on things involving potential partnerships
undefined says Understandable. Thank you then I’ll keep waiting. 🙂
undefined says have you checked my audit ?
undefined says Guys i got a question, i know that arbitrum one is highly alike to erc20, but do i really not have to change any of my code if the code is originally designed for erc20?
undefined says that's correct, if you're using some standard ERC20 like OpenZeppelin defines, there are no changes required
undefined says okok tyty!
undefined says wait, i got a side question, if i were to also develop a fee system thats additional to the gas fee, would that also be acceptable for arb?
undefined says yeah Arb is permissionless, so whatever fee mechanics you code into your contract are up to you
undefined says okay great! thx bro
undefined says guys, i reallly need some help here, if i were to depoly my smart contract on REMIX IDE, should i be choosing L2 ARBITRUM ONE or Injected provider for the "environment"(then choose arbitrum ONE in metamusk, which is the provider)
undefined says reallly need an answer guys, sorry for the rush, but my project is scheduled to launch in exatly 33mins (12am in vancouver time) @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says They are in different timezone, You will have to wait until they are back
undefined says ahhh... welp, guess im doomed xD
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs could you please help here?
undefined says I'm replying to you in #📬︱support please check
undefined says @Dan how did you deploy on testnet what did you use, it's strange because it should be the same when going to production
undefined says I have a question, for what reason, Arbitrum use ETH to pay the submission fee instead of ARB, is it because of the exchange rate of ETH and ARB
undefined says Eth was initially used as the gas token for Arbitrum because it didn't have its own token at launch. However, Arbitrum now has its own token, called ARB. I think the community should make a proposal to switch to using ARB as the gas token for Arbitrum.

( This is just my assumption )
undefined says also check the docs: https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging about messaging
undefined says Hey @Dan , Is your query solved?
undefined says 
undefined says hey guys, just wanted to share that we launched a reference spec website for rollups called **rollup.codes **, incl. Arbitrum One with info on opcodes, system contracts, precompiles, gas costs, info on l2-l1 messaging etc. Can't share a link here obviously but this is what it looks like lol. Any feedback or feature requests are appreciated!
undefined says Thanks, Will check it out
undefined says I'm sorry Aaron please let team to reply here 🙏
undefined says He is asking for the feedbacks
undefined says The community is not allowed to give feedbacks?
undefined says please don't talk on behalf of the team, you need a role please ask for the role 🙏
undefined says I am not a team member, I am a community member
undefined says I can’t share feedback? @roo
undefined says I understand thanks 🙏 😅
undefined says So I can’t give requests or feedback’s?
undefined says not sure what you mean please leave this channel to engineering team and questions about protocol 🙏 unless you have a feedback about protocol there is also #🔬︱research channel
undefined says hi @zhivkoto you can also open a post in https://research.arbitrum.io
undefined says Although I am not a developer, I understand basic things. You have built a great tool, mate. Developers can compare and analyze in a single dashboard. Good stuff! More power to you!
undefined says Not rwrong channel
undefined says any reason for this high gas period?
undefined says do you have an example
undefined says please refer to https://l2fees.info/
undefined says 
undefined says Loll he is asking about smart contracts
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Do not post links. Community members are prohibited from posting links. avoid as much as possible @kotovdmitriy
undefined says it's due to security to protect this server team disabled links
undefined says it should be 0.1 gwei normally no?
undefined says there is something going on in L2 space today that brings gas fees high please wait and try again
undefined says ok guys. who knows how to calculate arbitrum fees for smart contract method? I tryed to estimate fee by calling ```gasEstimateComponents``` from official documentation and its work perfectly for simple transactions(like sending eth between 2 addresses) but its not working for smart contract methods
undefined says are you on testnet @FreeZy ?
undefined says reposting : 

Hey, you can find out how Arbitrum calculate fees here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

If you're looking for specific functions to call, you can make use of ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei(), which will give you all gas data you need. For the L1 part, you have the second value returned which will give you the fees to be paid for each byte of data of your transaction, and for the L2 part, you have the sixth value returned => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L34-L44 .
undefined says No.
undefined says which rpc are you using?
undefined says my own full node
undefined says got it are you on mainnet right
undefined says Yes I am
undefined says how do you configure gas and network are you using any dev tools to deploy?
undefined says as you see. That value is equal to 1.11 gwei
undefined says it doesn't depends on me. Just query the gas using any rpc you want and you will see
undefined says I read this article and i understand how it works. I cant calculate `L1 calldata size` is there any method to get this data?
undefined says but how do you configure your gas limit can you show please
undefined says let me check one sec
undefined says this code from arbitrum github. it works when u estimate simple tx. send eth between 2 addresses. 

but when u put `data` of smart contract method its not working
undefined says it is not relate dto me do you understand this? just look to random transactions
undefined says please give me the latest tx of your deployment I need something I don't have time to check arbiscan.io sorry
undefined says 
undefined says could you point me at the repo pls
undefined says sure
undefined says 0x5e279d7d973bc5f372876d3b221ef6451b0cdadb0eb30131fdc859b59971b3e8
undefined says understood, appreciate the help and support 🙏
undefined says could you check with treasureDAO this tx been assosiated with them: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x5e279d7d973bc5f372876d3b221ef6451b0cdadb0eb30131fdc859b59971b3e8 it also was a big amount
undefined says look doesn't matter... You are not understanding
undefined says Hey @FreeZy, Arb gas price can spike if the chain gets busy and congested. Note that on Arbitrum gas price can change much faster than on Ethereum and this could happen during the network congestion.
undefined says Looking at Arbiscan, looks like it's come back to 0.1 Gwei now though
undefined says Is there a list of words that I can't use. Each time the bot blocks my messages. it is impossible to have a normal dialogue
undefined says Avoid "h i h ell o" and links where possible
undefined says apart this?
undefined says There are also such as d m and so on. I don't have a list
undefined says It ban words that are commons in defi wold like g a s  pr i c e
undefined says There are words blacklisted during times of high bot and scammer volume to protect users.
undefined says I understand it can be frustrating, but the list will be getting overhauled soon.
undefined says can u send me your github username
undefined says ok. now changing topic. I was measuring the performance of http vs websocket vs IPC. In theory websocket and IPC should be faster right? for some reason this is not the case
undefined says In block 70523241, the L2 Base Fee (0xbF5041Fc07E1c866D15c749156657B8eEd0fb649) gets the total amount of l2 gas used by transactions multiplied by 0.1 Gwei. But the receipt_effective_gas_price for all transactions in the block is 0.10055 Gwei. Could someone explain to me this difference?
undefined says 
undefined says Yep, in the end, i used the same way, and it was successful
undefined says It is currently the weekend, so please be patient and wait for a response from a team member
undefined says The mentioned L2 Base Fee contract only collects the minimum basefee of 0.1 gwei. If the basefee is above 0.1 gwei, the difference goes to the L2 Surplus Fee contract 0x32e7AF5A8151934F3787d0cD59EB6EDd0a736b1d
undefined says both RewardDistributor contracts have the same recipient. They're just separated to make tracking fee collection simpler.
undefined says can anyone kindly suggest me the best protocol where can we lock liquidity for uniswap on arbitrum?
undefined says sir please help me , i did the bridge on 22 june from abritrum nova to eth mainnet , but until now it has not arrived nor has it come back !!
undefined says I still can't claim. I've done everything even generated the qr code
undefined says Hey there. When the support team comes online and they open the #📬︱support channel again, kindly write down the issues you're having, and the support  team will help you out.
undefined says Nova bridges to the ETH mainnet through the official website bridge, which requires a 7-day challenge period
undefined says After the 7-day challenge period, you need to claim. Funds will be returned to your L1 wallet after claiming
undefined says need help. I withdraw funds through the official bridge from NOVA to ETHMAIN. today I wanted to claim funds, but all transactions and the transfer confirmation tab disappeared from the bridge. Where do I go to confirm the withdrawal of funds?
undefined says I see that arbiter has provided you with detailed answers in #💬︱general
undefined says Try not to post the same information on different channels. Post questions in #💬︱general and #📬︱support , team members or others will reply you in time
undefined says Typescript sdk gas estimation not working with smart contract data. I created issue on GitHub. @roo can u send me your github nick name I’ll tag you in  this issue?
undefined says i need help with the air drop
undefined says Scammer
undefined says mmm
undefined says Please add our project to the arbitrum nova portal.  We have done everything to meet the requirements.  We have a finished product, we have a website, we audited a smart contract (which, by the way, was not cheap).  Until we are added to the portal, we cannot do marketing.  And it turns out that the development of the project stopped at this very moment.  Too much effort, time and money has been invested in the project, so we can't just stop.
undefined says do you remmber their handle?
undefined says please wait for the team to reply 🙏
undefined says there is also tg channel: https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1674471595644014594?s=20
undefined says Ok🙏
undefined says Patiently waiting as well 🙂 hope your project is doing well
undefined says 
undefined says What is the meaning of `sendRoot` or `outputRoot` in Outbox.sol? (can't post link to the contracts on github, it's in src/bridge/Outbox.sol)
undefined says please check: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/b20fa84a0b3024668b9c2bc65871a7b142443c63/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L123 https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L30 https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/bridge/Outbox.sol#L74
undefined says does submitting a transaction with higher gas make a difference in arbitrum pls ?
undefined says The sequencer prioritizes transactions on a first-come first-served basis. Because tips do not make sense in this model, they are ignored. Arbitrum users always just pay the basefee regardless of the tip they choose.
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas
undefined says Thanks for response, I understand that second one is L2 block hash. However the first value is mentioned in comments and parameter names as "send root", "root", "root hash". It is not clear to me what root is this exactly, it doesnt seem to be L1 block root nor L2 block root, could it be hash of outbox txs? Or could you please tell me what data does the send root refer to?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs if you could help them pls ^
undefined says 
undefined says wondering if someone could help me understand why my bridge tx is reverting? `0xa18520fb2cb634859753dfa9984228be7fe66612eccd955b1cbc57032a062bc7`
undefined says 
undefined says The send root is the merkle root of l2 to l1 tx, it is used to proof an user’s l2 to l1 tx is correct so the outbox can execute
undefined says Your data is wrong: https://dashboard.tenderly.co/tx/mainnet/0xa18520fb2cb634859753dfa9984228be7fe66612eccd955b1cbc57032a062bc7, you can see how to structure data here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/src/lib/assetBridger/erc20Bridger.ts#L540
undefined says Is this one: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/issues/306 ?
undefined says You need to claim it on https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says You can find a project you like here: https://portal.arbitrum.io/one
undefined says ah interesting. i was able to bridge USDC last Dec with that data, but looks like things have changed. How would I calculate `maxSubmissionCost` ?
I see this:
> - `uint256 maxSubmissionCost`: The maximum amount of ETH to be paid for submitting the ticket. This amount is (1) supplied within the deposit (l1CallValue) to be later deducted from sender's L2 balance and is (2) directly proportional to the size of the retryable’s data and L1 basefee
undefined says also it seems that connecting a Safe to the bridge frontend doesn't work clicking on "Move funds to Arbitrum One"..nothing happens
undefined says thanks for the response Jason!
Is there any way to get latest L2 block hash (or state root) on L1 on-chain? Or is there any on-chain way to get the latest merkle root of l2 to l1 txs so I can query it from the mapping? my use case is a zk bridge impl and I want to reuse the block hashes available on arbitrum's contracts.
undefined says You can calculate like this: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/bridge/Inbox.sol#L507 , I would recommend you to use sdk to do this:  https://developer.arbitrum.io/sdk , and here is the related tutorial: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/token-deposit
undefined says Oh, you can’t use smart contract wallet to use bridge directly since it will alias your address
undefined says You can do this with latest confirmed rollup block: https://github.com/ensdomains/arb-resolver#1-prove-a-certain-l2-block-hash-correspond-to-a-noderblockraw-block-state-with-the-assertion
undefined says is it possible to decode the sequencer feed and get the l2 block number for the message please ?
undefined says ok, so the sequencer feed only has transactions in it, no blocknumber. How do the rpc nodes know what block a transaction belongs to ?
undefined says RPC nodes actually process the messages in the feed through the state transition function which deterministically derives the block boundaries
undefined says thanks, thats super intersting - how does it deterministically do it ? is there some kind of token in the message that works it out ? or is it something else please ?
undefined says Is there a faucet for mainnet?
undefined says @teddytomas The sequencer feed does have the L1 block number. Here we explain how one can decode the data:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed
undefined says There isn't any faucet for the mainnet.
But you can get Goerli faucets from here: https://goerlifaucet.com
undefined says thanks, but I wanted the l2 block
undefined says Execution on Arbitrum is fully deterministic; i.e., a current chain state along with new input data is sufficient to compute the new chain state. So the moment this input data is available (i.e., when the Sequencer posts a batch), the L2 chain's state can be computed. 
What happens is once the sequencer's batch is finalized on L1, all nodes can deterministically figure out the corresponding L2 block.
undefined says I'm trying to deploy a few contracts to Arbitrum One but the gas fees are much higher. I'm not sure why
undefined says The "Estimated total gas used for script" is 5x the other networks we are deploying to which is confusing to me because it's the same bytecode
undefined says We would love to deploy our project to Arb today if possible. Thanks for your help 🤗
undefined says I would be able to look into this if you could provide the hash of the transaction. 
Technically, gas on Arbitrum has 2 components: L1 gas and L2 gas. You can read more about it here:  https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 
And most of the gas used by transactions goes to the L1 part which is heavily dependant on your calldata size (you can find these info within the  `Advanced TxInfo` tab in the tx view of the Arbiscan).
undefined says Ah ok I see, that makes sense. Thanks for the insight.
undefined says When does the L2 Surplus Fee balance change? I need to understand the use cases
undefined says When sending the tx, anything above base (currently 0.1 gwei for arb1) goes to L2 surplus
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x32e7AF5A8151934F3787d0cD59EB6EDd0a736b1d
undefined says For arb1, you can add arb1 genesis block number (22207817) to feed message’s sequence number, that is the l2 block number.
undefined says 
undefined says What is the fastest way to verify a transaction I submitted to the sequencer has been confirmed (success or failure tx doesnt matter). Is it a check transaction receipt or subscribing to sequencer?

Is the process  different for a successful transaction/failed one? Does the sequencer only tell if a transaction has been confirmed?
undefined says You can just try get transaction receipt, if you don’t trust others rpc service, you can run your own one.
undefined says If your tx revert, you can also get receipt.
undefined says Thanks for the reply. Will the transaction receipt be when the sequencer confirms it or when l1 confirms the batch? Also does the sequencer show if a transaction is successful or not or only if it will confirm.
undefined says After sequencer confirmed, no need to wait l1 confirm, the receipt has status field which can tell you success or failed.
undefined says Yeah I know that transaction receipt has status field does decoding the sequencer feed also have status field or is it only the transaction input data?
undefined says The feed message only contains tx, no tx receipt, you need to run a node to execute that tx then get receipt.
undefined says Appreciate it thanks
undefined says Np
undefined says Thanks for your answer. But I found some blocks where the balance decreases. For example in block 70504822, the balance decreases by 13750300000000. What is that case?
undefined says I need to understand how the refunds mechanism works in Classic and how I can reconstruct it from the createRetryableTicket and redeem transactions. Can you point me to documentation about this process? It has to be for Classic, not Nitro. Thank you.
undefined says if I query a node for the blocknumber does it guarantee that that specific block has been completely processed from the sequencer pls ? ie the state is consistent with that block ?
undefined says Hey, I do have some assumptions, but please allow me to consult with the team and provide you with reliable information at a later time.
undefined says There's documentation about the differences between Classic and Nitro in this document => https://developer.arbitrum.io/migration/dapp_migration#breaking-changes
It goes through the changes applied retryables too. Hope that helps.
undefined says Hey, if you request a specific block to a node, and the node returns the block's information, it means that that node has processed that block. Does that answer your question?
undefined says thanks response... not quite! 

If I query for the latest blocknumber (not a previous one) - does it mean the blocknumber I receive has been fully processed by the rpc node ?
undefined says Yeap, the block you'll get is the latest block your node has processed
undefined says I was wondering if there was anyway to look into the details of specific transactions and whether they were challenged. Challenged as in someone getting caught committing fraud and getting there stakes slashed during the "challenging window" of 7 days.
undefined says Hey Ana! wanted to ask if we are almost done with our 2nd audit - should we be sending it again to partnerships@offchainlabs.com as well? @Ana 💙 Arbitrum
undefined says I think that would be better 🙂 
Sharing all the info when it’s ready in a single email, including the Company that is evaluating you
undefined says no problem ill share everything again with the evaluation company included as well + all necessary social links/Dapp etc. Thank you!
undefined says Thank you. Were you able to ask that to the team?
undefined says Hey @William X - curious if you were able to resolve this issue. I’m having the same problem via foundry
undefined says I just had a bunch of eth in my deploy wallet and it is fine. Also you can break up your contracts deploys so you deploy  one by one instead of all at once- you don’t pay the inflated quote btw
undefined says Currently no challenge happens on arb1, but you can see the challenge logic here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/b20fa84a0b3024668b9c2bc65871a7b142443c63/contracts/src/challenge
undefined says Thanks for the insight. I got it to work properly with the `legacy`. Don’t know what it does but it worked lol
undefined says Oh how did you put legacy- is it an argument in foundry or is it an rpc thing
undefined says It’s a foundry flag, I just added `--legacy` to the `forge script` command
undefined says hey support team, I am trying to verify this contract on arbiscan but getting error. `0xA238CBeb142c10Ef7Ad8442C6D1f9E89e07e7761`.

Error: 

`Error! Unable to generate Contract ByteCode and ABI (No match found)`

The same contract is verified on other networks. Can you please help?
Would be happy to give more details if any needed.
undefined says where are you seeing it on arbiscan?
undefined says When I submit the source code to get contract verified.
undefined says please talk to etherscan.io they are managing arbiscan.io
undefined says Let's say I execute `block.timestamp`  in a solidity smart contract, which block number is going to return? L1 (Ethereum block number) or L2 (arbitrum sequencer block Number) ? @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says it is the sequencer's clock value each block, not the L1 timestamp. ` block.number` however, will be the L1's block number. To get L2 block number, call ` ArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber()`
undefined says and how can i get the L1 (ETH) block timestamp? @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says I am having hard time verifying contracts on arbitrum goerli testnet using hardhat etherscan. Is 421613 chain supported ?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says hey @Ricardo__Gordon | Arbitrum we rotate shifts, and I'm currently on shift (not Jose), so unless Jose had a thread with the user, it's ok to just wait for us to reply (unless a long time has passed with no responses from us)
undefined says are you verifying on Arbiscan? What command are you running, what's the exact error that hardhat puts out?
undefined says checking to see if there's a source for that on chain. Do you need it in the context of a smart contract? the L2 timestamp will be more accurate (as it updates multiple times per second, vs L1's 12 seconds between blocks)
undefined says yes i need it in the context of a smart contract
undefined says curious why a more accurate timestamp isn't sufficient? generally timestamps are used for minimum condition checking (ie at least x seconds have passed) rather than pegged to a specific value
undefined says Ahh. Thanks for letting me know. I saw him online that's why I appointed him 😛
undefined says 
undefined says I am running 2 Relays under the same condition, while they present around 20ms latency difference. 
Interesting! I am very curious what causes the difference. Cloud be Load balance, Priority, Map or anything else? Thanks so much!
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Were you able to ask that to the team?
undefined says could just be round robin ordering from the sequencer
undefined says Is debug_traceCallMany not supported in Arbitrum? 
Running a erigon L1 node in backend which supports this method and it is working on erigon but not on arbitrum.
undefined says We only support go-ethereum type debug call so we just support debug_traceCall
undefined says Dear community, I am asking for your help. Help our team solve the following problem. In order to get on the arbitrum portal platform, several conditions need to be met, one of which is:
"Please list at least one reputable cryptocurrency figure who would willingly be your recommendation. This person must have a track record and a positive reputation in the cryptocurrency or technology industry..." 
We wrote to some teams, but got the response, "Sorry, we can't vouch for people we don't know.
We're just a nameless team, we don't have any connections to such projects, but everyone starts somewhere. Isn't that right?
We've put everything we can into this project, and there are challenges along the way that we can't solve on our own.  This raises the question of what is a team like us to do? So the arbitrum ecosystem is a closed community where only the "special" can enter?  I turn to the teams, developers or moderators who sit here. Someone vouch for us, in exchange we can leave a link to your project on our site (we have nothing else to offer unfortunately). Best wishes, Sam
undefined says I have created API key on arbiscan just like we can on etherscan and tried verifying via hardhat (npx hardhat verify --network arbtirumTestnet "<contract>")

But I get
undefined says Hey, you can run `npx hardhat verify --list-networks` to see hardhat verify supported network, and for arb goerli, it should be arbitrumGoerli       │ 421613, rather than arbitrumTestnet
undefined says Hello, sir, we know that you are a good project, but as I talked to you before, many unendorsed projects will go through some rugs after they are listed on the portal. Any project can be deployed to arbitrum and is very welcome. But due to some risk prevention, we have to formulate some strict rules, I hope you can understand.
undefined says That command is not working for me
undefined says And isn't npx hardhat verify --network 'Name' picking up the rpc and network name from hardhat config ?
undefined says According to hardhat's docs, they mentioned `The identifiers shown there are the ones that should be used as keys in the apiKey object.`, so i think you need to use arbitrumGoerli as the key in apiKey object.
undefined says https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#multiple-api-keys-and-alternative-block-explorers This command mentioned here
undefined says I am doing exact same thing. As they have mentioned the identifier key can be any name.
undefined says And this is how my config looks like. Where SCAN_API_KEY is from arbitrum
undefined says And if i do a single key rather than multiple, I still get unsupported
undefined says No, I don’t think they mean that, they mean the key should equal to the identifier returned from `npx hardhat verify --list-networks`
undefined says I am not sure --list-networks is not working for me
undefined says You can just try change the key to arbitrumGoerli
undefined says Might be version reason, you can upgrade your @nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify version
undefined says Updated etherscan, now --list-networks working. However, the verification still was failing. I renamed the network name in my config the same as apiKey identifier. Now it works. Thanks !
undefined says Np!
undefined says Jason, tell me how you can solve this problem? maybe the company that did the audit for us will be suitable?
undefined says Already let our partnerships team know, and they will give me feed back next week
undefined says Btw, this channel is tech channel, you can ask this in #📬︱support or #💬︱general , if no one answered you, you can @ me.
undefined says If you have someone within the audit firm can provide you reference might work, but not so sure, you can ask this via portal-listing@offchainlabs.com
undefined says H
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs to add onto the convo you guys are having then can I confirm that to get listed on portals = need audit, need to put in Audit company name and get them to be a reference and/or email listing@offchainlabs.com for further info and/or ask any current arb listed on portals to come forward to be a reference and/or get a reputable person in the crypto space to vouch
undefined says @Ana 💙 Arbitrum is this the correct SOP? Cause now I’m getting a bit confused as I don’t want to keep on sending additional emails
undefined says Hi,
You can send an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com so our partners can create a private gp to get in touch for better communication 
Also feel free to send me a DM so I can give you TG handle of our partners who can help you with this.
undefined says I just want to make sure if I understand it correctly.
Arbitrum Orbit allows each project that is build on Arbitrum to create they own L3 chain on top of Arbitrum?
And the fees can be paid in the project token?
Who will be the sequencers?
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs  already sent you a dm! Thank you so much, looking forward to the TG handle
undefined says Anybody, even if not not deployed on Arbitrum, can deploy their own Orbit chain on top of Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova.
Also on the release version, yup, fees can be paid in any ERC20 tokens, or ETH.
For sequencer, right now on devnet, you can run it locally. but for realease version, we're in touch with providers and also Sequencer as Services, to have support of this.
undefined says I have found that eth_call with pending block is not working on nitro node. Is it intensional  ? or is there any flag to enable accessing pending block ?
undefined says Arbitrum doesn't have pending blocks because the system is different from Ethereum in case of block production and block validation.
Arbitrum doesn't need to have consensus between nodes, because nodes uses sequencer feed and also L1, to find the ordered transactions, and based on that ordered transaction as a source of truth, each can use State Transition Function to transit to the new state.
This may help you: https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle
Also for diving deeper on what's going on Arbitrum you can read this: https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
undefined says 
undefined says does reading sequencer feed from the websocket will enable me to read the current pending transactions ?
undefined says is they any api endpoint to query this arbiscan.io/tokens   to get the top traded tokens in arbitrum?
undefined says I want to get the top traded tokens on arbitrum network
undefined says Is there any way to get L1 block hash on Arbitrum? (I tried searching for this in the arbsys precompiles)
undefined says how can i get L2 block number in solidity? can anyone give an example source code?
undefined says What is your project about ?
Lets talk and I'll see if I can be of any help to you.
undefined says Our `nitro/l2chaindata` dir is almost 4T now, is this what other node operators have as well?
undefined says ```error acting as staker                   err="error advancing stake from node 6634 (hash 0xae5ec996b11e127d9fb8082d8b11d8102858fd1454a60b64dd9a088443c23edc): error generating node action: waiting for validator to catch up to assertion blocks: 109292212/109295327"```
undefined says Encounter this error and the node stop syncing, could anyone help on this?
undefined says No, sequencer feed only give you confirmed tx.
undefined says Sorry, we don’t provide this type api, but you can go to our portal, and select infra/tools categories and see if they support those api you want: https://portal.arbitrum.io
undefined says Hey, don’t know if l1 block number works for you, you can get related l1 block number by calling eth_getTransactionReceipt, if you mean you want to get that on chain, you can just call block.number which will return l1’s block number.
undefined says Here it is: https://developer.arbitrum.io/time#arbitrum-block-numbers
undefined says Oh, you need to prune your node by --init.prune value, Value can be "full" for full nodes serving RPC requests, or "validator" for validators (Only works after v2.0.14)
undefined says Are you running a staked node? Staked node needs whitelist, if your address not in whitelist, you can just run watch tower validator.
undefined says ok, will use watch tower mode
undefined says Thank you, will try
undefined says 
undefined says why is posting a link not allowed? i wrote a huge msg quoting a legit link to some documentation and now its all gone, i have to type again
undefined says actually i want to trustlessly prove some L1 state by providing state proofs on arbitrum, for that access to block hash would be very helpful. for e.g. optimism have added a precompile for the recent block hash (pls remove the spaces here if interested to check: `https : // community.optimism.io /docs/developers/bedrock/how-is-bedrock-different/#l2-contracts-predeploys`)

I want to propose Arbitrum to not only support recent L1 block hash through precompile but also allow retrieving some recent block hashes, e.g. last 256 L1 block hashes, since generating state proofs would take some time and by the time user provides them on L2, the precompile would return a new block hash. Is there a procedure like EIPs that I can follow?
undefined says I found blocks where the balance of L2 Surplus Fee decreases without any trace. I understand that L2 Surplus Fee gets fees beyond 0.1 gwei.
But when does its balance decrease? 
For example in block 70504822, the balance decreases by 13750300000000 and there is no trace. What is that case?
undefined says okay
undefined says Hi! Does anyone knows if i can customize Nitro as a proof of authortiy-permissioned network, where I can choose which validator can approve a transaction? this is for creating a consortium blockchain. I am searching alternatives to hyperledger fabric
undefined says Hey,
You can discuss it on the Arbitrum Foundation Forum:
https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/
undefined says Hey,
Thanks for telling this! this is a known issue which is patched on next ArbOS verion and will be up soon
undefined says Hey,
With Arbitrum Orbit, you can setup an Anytrust Orbit chain, which you can have control over some parameters, like having a permissioned blockchain.
for more info read here pls:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction
undefined says thanks, will check now
undefined says I have tried all three types of open-source compilers, but I always encounter this error: "Error! Unable to generate Contract ByteCode and ABI (General Exception, unable to get compiled [bytecode])".                                                         Please assist me in resolving this error and verifying my self-deployed smart contract on the Arb chain browser.
undefined says Thanks Mehdi, do you know if that balance is transferred to another particular address or where it goes?
undefined says Here are some things you should check:

(1) Verify the compiler version.
(2) Check if optimization is enabled. If you are using Remix, you can find this in the compile section.
(3) Confirm whether you are using any libraries. If you are, make sure to include those libraries as well.
(4) Ensure that the Solidity code you are using to compile is exactly the same.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, I recommend contacting the Etherscan team, who maintains Arbiscan. You can reach out to them using the support ticket link provided: https://etherscan.io/contactus
undefined says The net fee collected by the system does not change, but it is transferred to the L2 Base.
undefined says can someone give me geroli test eth?  0x81fc7b86316Bb26b4ceC8f38121Bab70b39672F2
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain LabsI contacted the team through the email you mentioned, but it has been five days and I haven't received any response at all.
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain LabsIs there no direct way to contact the engineers? This contact mechanism and efficiency are too low!
undefined says What issues do you meet? You can just ask here
undefined says Hey team, our project wants to use a bridge to transfer tokens between Arbitrum and Ethereum. Is there any upper limit on the number of total tokens that can be transferred via the Arbitrum bridge? Like for wormhole bridge its equal to uint(64).max tokens.
undefined says Arbitrum official bridge doesn’t have this limit, but when you use it to bridge your token back to l1, you need wait 7-8 days.
undefined says Can you also tell me more about how the bridge works? Do we need to upgrade our ERC20 token into a new form, or can it be used as it is? Our token is already trading, so upgrading it to a new form of token might be a hassle. Also, what would be the further steps to integrate with Arbitrum Bridge? Do we need to fill out a form?
undefined says gm!
is it possible user can place transactions, on their purpose?
if transactions are processed by FCFS
(tx1 => tx2 => tx3)
undefined says Is your token follow the standard erc20 implement? If so, you can just use our bridge, it will automatically deploy a standard token on l2 for you, if not, you need see https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#the-arbitrum-generic-custom-gateway
undefined says No, the order depends on when they arrived sequencer
undefined says so it is not guaranteed that the three  transactions placed one by one.
but is there any possibility?
undefined says I mean, user can’t insert their tx to any order, the order of tx only depends on when they arrived sequencer.
undefined says Thanks for the help.
undefined says I read about it, but one thing, just to understand better, in case we wanted to use a self hosting solution do we need to settle on arbitrum l2? i imagine this require a cost, and we are restricted at the moment from buying tokens (its a political thing mainly)
undefined says Your Orbit chain will have to settle to an L2 chain, yes. The onchain cost of this settlement is just the fees paid in every transaction, basically L2 + L3, similar to how Arbitrum chains handle L1+L2 fees => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 .

Besides that, running a Sequencer and/or a validator (and/or a DAS server) has some "offchain" infrastructure costs too (servers, etc.)
undefined says I see, thank you for your answer
undefined says what are your plans for supporting the push0 opcode? vyper 0.3.8/0.3.9 fixed a problem with 0.3.7 that among other things prevented arbiscan from verifying source code in random cases but 0.3.8/9 also introduced support for push0
undefined says Supporting push0 code is an update that requires going through the DAO, so it might take some time to be supported. But it's definitely on our roadmap.
undefined says thank you Jose'
undefined says Hey. Please take a look at #🤝︱careers. There are a lot of offers there that you might find interesting and can easily apply. 👍
undefined says What are the current long-term plans/process for the Gas Floor settings? The Arbitrum documentation lists the fact that they exist, but has no information on the "why?" and any plans to change them. Arbitrum One being held to a 0.1 gwei floor makes it a decently-expensive rollup L2. Optimism has gas less than 0.000001 gwei recently, which is a dramatically different cost comparison.

I believe there was a narrative that the artificial Gas Floor limit was a way to keep adoption lower while Arbitrum was in testing phase/rollout. Is that accurate, and if so, when will that "phase" be done? Is keeping an enforced floor limit helping at this point?
undefined says We also need to prevent hacker use a short calldata but contains a huge computation op codes to dos the blockchain network.
undefined says Is anyone familiar with the arbitrum code and how challenging works specifically?
undefined says We have docs about challenge here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/proving/challenge-manager and also the challenge code: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/challenge/ChallengeLib.sol
undefined says @soham @soham
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsI said that I cannot verify my smart contract code on the Arb chain browser. I need technical support to open source it, and I need an engineer to uninstall it. I have sent an email seven days ago, but no one has replied to assist me in resolving the issue.I have tried all three types of open-source compilers, but I always encounter this error: "Error! Unable to generate Contract ByteCode and ABI (General Exception, unable to get compiled [bytecode])".
undefined says Do you remember which compiler version you used to compile?
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsI remember.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsI can send you the source code for you to review, but I just can't verify it.
undefined says Can you check if your bytecode on chain (which you can see at arbiscan) is the same as you local compile with that version compiler?
undefined says Ok, just send me
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsI compiled it using the corresponding version, but I still encountered errors. Should I post the source code here?
undefined says Dm me please
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain LabsI compiled it using the corresponding version, but I still encountered errors. Should I post the source code here?Moreover, there is a time limit for message replies here.
undefined says I mean you can send me private message, not through this channel
undefined says You need to check your if  compiled bytecode same to the one on chain.
undefined says Wouldn't a transaction with "huge computation op codes" also need a large number of gas units? So even if the gas cost per unit were low, doing massive amounts of calculations in a single transaction would be a high gas cost?

If that is an attack vector concern, how does Optimism (as another "rollup" style L2) not be susceptible to it?

If it's to mitigate attacks, why is Arbitrum Nova's limit lower than Arbitrum One's?
undefined says Optimism is not that cheap in practice, they use a different pricing mechanism than we do, but they also have L1 costs they have to pay; both chains vary in cost from block to block, but are generally comparable in cost, as you can see at: https://l2fees.info/
undefined says 
undefined says The Optimism gas tracker (which I cannot link to in this channel) cites the Optimism gas cost as 1.48e-7 gwei currently (0.000000148 gwei; 148 wei), making an ETH transfer about $0.06, even though that l2fees site indicates currently it would be about $0.08.
undefined says yes, costs fluctuate from block to block, depending on L1 demand; and if you refresh L2 Fees from time to time you'll see various estimates depending on how L1 data has fluctuated
undefined says that gas tracker is not telling the whole story; 6 cents is about 1/20th the cost of mainnet; not 1/50 millionths
undefined says Sure; I guess it's not directly comparable since Optimism separates out their L1 gas cost from the L2 gas cost. However, my question remains how they can have such a low fee for their L2 part (compared to Arbitrum), and not be susceptible to whatever attack vector Arbirum is worried about?
undefined says I believe Optimism is probably losing money right now on their L2 fees; I'm not even sure if they have a demand based mechanic for their L2 fees right now; so they are probably subsidizing costs
undefined says But "losing money" is not the same as "being DOS attacked". I guess what I'm asking is what would happen if Arbitrum One's minimum gas was dropped from 0.1 gwei to 0.001 gwei?
undefined says sure it is; for one they do not have fraud proofs in place, so there is no way to dispute a state transition on Optimism. but also, they are incurring costs they're not representing with their gas price fixed at where it's at. but OP is very centralized at this point in time; it's less decentralized than Polygon
undefined says OP can't DOS themselves, they control the mempool and the sequencer and there are no other validators
undefined says they will have to worry about that when they catch up
undefined says My use-case is as a developer I'm trying to port an NFT collection's metadata to other chains. I stored a chunk of that data on Optimism in transaction `0xfbc8a6be7e264a298e122c9f2ca2bd2f64f9e9dcff512e7b5a50000fc596502c`, and it cost about 0.002 ETH. I believe if I were to do that same transaction (9.1M gas units) on Arbitrum One, it would be much more expensive (correct?). Is that the sort of transaction you consider "DOS" transactions (if there were done a lot at once)?
undefined says this one: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0xfbc8a6be7e264a298e122c9f2ca2bd2f64f9e9dcff512e7b5a50000fc596502c ?
undefined says Yep, that one.
undefined says so we do data compression on calldata that we post to L1; when I ran that through it comes out to about 12.9KB of compressed data, which is about half the maximum smart contract size (25 kb); I don't think it would be much more expensive, but can get a more specific estimate for you; would be cheaper on Arbitrum Nova
undefined says how many of those transactions do you need to post?
undefined says 10 transactions (take a peek at the contract that Optimism transaction is pointing to: `0xf00e9cF6a96dFAd869f676022F49761632A3aA2C`; a similar contract is deployed on several L2s, and my gas-cost estimator on my wallet for the Arbitrum one was quoting a much higher value to do the transaction on Arbitrum, so I paused doing it.
undefined says also, can you break them down into smaller chunks? just asking, because if you reduced the size about 25% for each chunk and sent them spaced out by at least a couple seconds it would be cheaper
undefined says Yes, I can break them down into arbitrary sizes; I was targeting a high gas unit cost to minimize the number of transactions. On Arbitrum would it be cheaper to do more chunks of smaller size?
undefined says yes, because we have a 7M gas per second target and gas price increases after that (even though block limit is 30M)
undefined says All right, thanks; I'll play with my deployer script code and scale it down to target 6M gas units/chunk and see if that makes the estimate more sane.
undefined says for sure; also what are you using for estimate? have you tried deploying to Arb Goerli?
undefined says To estimate, my deployer script was just passing the transaction to Metamask, and allow its gas estimates to calculate.
undefined says For my overall question, is it Arbitrum's goal to keep the 0.1 Arbitrum One gas minimum in place forever? Or is there a roadmap to step it down (as other technologies/decentralizations get in place to guard against the attack vectors you're concerned about)?
undefined says hmm, I'm a bit more skeptical of MetaMask's estimates, ArbGoerli would be most accurate for gas usage and L1/L2 components
undefined says Arb will save quite a bit when EIP-4844 comes out; importantly, Arbitrum is economically stable in its current state based on the costs to run a truly decentralized rollup at scale; but of course if those costs drop due to improvements in tech and L1, the DAO can opt to lower fees at any time; you can look at Arbitrum Nova or launching an L3 Orbit chain for potentially even cheaper fees today
undefined says Why is Nova's minimum cost able to be lower (and seemingly still be "stable") than One's?

We may also deploy to Nova, but that would be in addition to One (there's other ecosystems on One we want to interact with), not instead of.
undefined says Arbitrum Goerli transaction `0xeb3d1c929b0b35fadc604d8f53caa6f1cb6ce4a01b8ba4295f68487273a766ef` done now, which is a scaled-back version of the same transaction interaction as the `0xfbc8a6be7e264a298e122c9f2ca2bd2f64f9e9dcff512e7b5a50000fc596502c` transaction on Optimism. With Arbitrum Goerli coming in at 1.6 Gwei currently, that came to about 0.01 ETH gas cost. But the Arbitrum Georli block explorer doesn't break down the L1 vs L2 gas costs?
undefined says Arbitrum goerli's l1 cost is not same as arb1 as their l1 gas price is too different, you can't simply compare the two
undefined says Hi!

I'm from Sayfer, a blockchain security company with 4+ years of experience. Our expertise involves supporting DeFi projects in terms of security, hence our partnerships with Tezos, BNB Chain, and 1inch Network, showcasing the quality of our services.

We had the chance to look at your treasury, and believe there's some ways we can help you guys further enhance your security; afterall, who couldn’t use an added layer of security to their protocol? 

Let's schedule a meeting, we’d love to take a deeper look at your security and help your platform in any way possible 🙂
undefined says Hey guys. Would it take a DAO vote in order to change the `implementation` of the UpgradeableBecaon here? `0xE72ba9418b5f2Ce0A6a40501Fe77c6839Aa37333`.

In light of recent events vis-a-vis Multichain, if this could be done, it could potentially free up millions of dollars that are current locked in Multichain contracts.
undefined says I'm not sure what you mean. I'm just looking into the faesibility of rescuing funds currently trapped in anyTokens deployed on Arbitrum.
undefined says is there any JS implementation to read feed relay? I only found a function in GO
undefined says As I understand it, an AIP would have to be submitted to do this.
undefined says But @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs indicated "ArbGoerli would be most accurate" for gas usage. Now that I've done a sample transaction of that type on Arbitrum Goerli, what can you derive from it as to what the approximate cost will be to do the same on Arbitrum One?

The `goerli.arbiscan.io` site doesn't break down transaction cost into L1 and L2 gas costs; is there another testnet block explorer that does show what the L2 component of the gas cost was?
undefined says This question I've still not been able to find a direct answer to: is it the plan to keep Arbitrum One at a 0.1 minimum L2 gas cost forever? Or under what circumstances would it be safe/good to start to slide it down?
undefined says Linking to my message in #💬︱general to provide some more context: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/1129409316563198065
undefined says It would be good to get input from the team ASAP, because as I understand it, funds could be moved by malicious parties at any time until such an AIP could be passed.
undefined says Can I get any kind of response on this? It's quite time sensitive.
undefined says Hey,
Could you please drop an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says I asked the foundation and they said unfortunately it’s not feasible
undefined says Not an official one at the moment
undefined says Any details on why this isn't faesible?
undefined says Should it be possible to run fork tests against an alchemy arbitrum URL? For some reason when trying to fork arbitrum in tests certain calls and contract deployments don't work. But they work when using a mainnet RPC. Anybody come across this before?
undefined says Are there any RPC providers on arbitrum that are generally regarded as faster than their competition?

Need a very fast RPC for a script I'm writing, and I'm not sure if it's worth trying to set up a custom RPC just for this purpose yet. Thanks guys 🙂
undefined says Is there any kind of way to set up a dialogue with them? People's life savings are at stake here. It would be good to have some two-way conversation and a technical explanation as to whether or not it's possible, rather than just 'no'. On the level of solidity, it looks doable to me.
undefined says This would have to be a DAO vote ser. You can defintely propose this to the DAO.
undefined says I'm aware. I just wanted to know if my understanding here was correct: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/585084330037084180/1129409316563198065

Thanks for getting back to me though.
undefined says How is it possible to deal with fork tests that need to run against ArbSys? Seems like they will always fail with invalid op code because ArbSys is non standard?
undefined says You'd probably need a fork of hardhat/foundry/revm with that opcode implemented.
undefined says RIP me, Fair enough, this is what I feared haha. For now we just do some dirty replacements for those bits 🫡
undefined says ~~Wait, is arbsys an opcode or a precompile?~~ Ah it's a precompile. Mostly the same situation, but I think maybe you could actually mock it by telling your local EVM to put a bunch of bytecode there? Not 100% sure.
undefined says 
undefined says I should be able to post GitHub links. The relevant isue would be foundry-rs/foundry/issues/748.

Also, my intuition seems right, you can just set the code: foundry-rs/foundry/issues/5085#issuecomment-1568825895
undefined says Actually after starting to write my own library, found exactly what you need: github/saucepoint/foundry-arbitrum/
undefined says Does this mean that each block has 32M gas limit?
undefined says Correct.
undefined says ok and why if I put a gas limit at 40M my transaction is always set at index 1 in the block?
undefined says It depends on your tx. If your tx consumes a lot L2 gas, so that it's not possible to pack it up with another tx in a block (for instance it uses ~32 M gas) then sequencer will put it in a separate block
undefined says nope it just consume 5M and the tot gas consumed is below 20M
undefined says I'll send exact details soon
undefined says 
undefined says I can't seem to say anything..
undefined says this
undefined says does this cover all fees
undefined says For bridged assets such as USDC (non-native), how can I see what bridge was used to mint it? e.g: `0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8` is the USDC(bridged) contract. Was this done over the native Arbitrum bridge?
undefined says What's your favorite dex for **Nova** tokens guys?
undefined says And ease of use for newbs? We were going to fork Uniswap and retheme and in-house our own swapping but I'm all set with dex regs later-on lol. We have 6 in-game tokens being released over the next 24 months.
undefined says Also, when it comes to bridging from ETH (or something else) what's the difference between gas/tx costs/time to process between Metamask/Celer and the Arbitrum bridge?
undefined says PS: I saw a tweet today that said the Arbitrum bridge is the only bridge. Which seemed counter to a users experience. I get the *want* to capture fees etc if that was the reasoning. Just looking for what's cheapest and fastest for my users though.
undefined says That was not the intention of the tweet. There are many people getting their wallets drained because of using fake arbitrum bridges. The intention was to raise awareness to people use the correct one.
undefined says gotcha, I thought that may be the other end of the story. But um... what about the questions I've asked.
undefined says Curious if there's a Nova community yet too. Maybe the foundation forums? I've got a lot of questions actually.
undefined says Most important 2 are best Dex for Nova and fastest/cheapest bridge
undefined says A third question (important) who would you say is Nova's biggest competitor and why? Like who's on the opposite side of the field if this were a competition. *I know for Arb One it's Optimism, but Arb is better. The reason we're choosing Nova is Vitalik's unwillingness to slay his rollups with danksharding. Which was cool. And I don't like Polygon at all. The biggest reason is you guys are based in NY, and I'm up in Boston with a team at MIT.  Seemed like a good fit.
undefined says 4th question is, are there any Arb meetups in Boston or NYC?
undefined says Also Dubai, I may be there in the late fall for 3-6 months
undefined says Well, in my opinion I don't think it would make much sense to build just a seperate community just for Nova. Afterall, Nova is part of the Arbitrum ecosystem, therefore we can discuss Nova right her in this Discord. That's what it was made for 💪 . Also you can always check at https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/ for some more interesting discussions/proposals, etc.
undefined says About the meetups, I'm sure that it will announced when they're gonna happen so...I would say to stay tuned.
undefined says There might be other events where arbitrum is going to be present and you'll be most welcome 🙂
undefined says Gotcha, what's the plan for long term sustainability, if Nova grows and the fees aren't sustaining the cost to process transactions, like is there an internal financial axis where server tech/electricity (becoming cheaper) and tx fees **meet** down the road? Or is the plan to wrap Nova as an enterprise solution.. I'm not into chain hopping users later know what I mean
undefined says Like once we build on it, we're staying 💪  But my thought is on the fees and sustainability.
undefined says *PS, I know in the beginning it's all about miner rewards and/or funding that vs cost to in-house it all.
undefined says In short, will fees on Nova be the same in 5 years?
undefined says Oh, the gas price depends on network load, if tx gas used above 7 m per second, then the gas price will increase, so it not even remain same now.
undefined says Just like Mehdi said, when sequence order your tx, if your tx limit is 40m, but there is another tx in that block, the sequencer will leave it there and put it into the next block to avoid gas not enough errors.
undefined says Ya but follow that thought through... what's the backstop there, if Nova gets huge; a 3rd network or centralization.
undefined says centralization is fine too, it's basically Mastercard. But idk if the math adds up r/n between the cost to process and the fees
undefined says Like is Nova unique in some way (to have such low fees).. or is it just under the radar still. Sell me on it dude 😎
undefined says We will continually upgrade the tech for arb1/nova too, like we will upgrade to stylus later this year which will scale the network too, so we don’t need to let the network to be centralized to process the growth usage.
undefined says Gotcha, I like that.
undefined says Another option is just infinite new networks... Nova Air, Stardust... just keep rolling em out like shards, and allow them all to cross bridge anything. Just name em all Arb.... Arb 1 2 3... eventually just take away the front end and make the chains work as rollups for your rollup. Which is what stylus must be?
undefined says If it is, I'll stay here and launch. I kinda wanna see someone take on Polygon
undefined says The biggest turnoff the past few years was their bridge. You guys would crush them if bridging was like a DEX swap. Cheap and under 5 mins. ETH/One ETH/NOVA ETH/BNB/POLYGON ETH lol whatever.
undefined says Stylus will let arbitrum support more smart contracts language like rust, that will significantly increase network efficiency. Also we have arbitrum orbit too, that will allow others deploy layer3s based on arb1 and arb nova.
undefined says Yes, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ArbitrumGateway.sol#L213 , the bridge can mint the token, and if token not bridge before (use standard gateway), the bridge will deploy one for it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ERC20Gateway.sol#L78
undefined says For others gateway, you can also deploy your l2 contract rather deployed by the bridge: https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-custom-generic
undefined says which node snapshot is the most recent one?

 nitro-pruned? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says nitro-pruned.tar and nitro-archive.tar are most recent one, it depends you want to run regular fullnode or archive node
undefined says regular node
undefined says ooh so it considers the gas limit not the real gas used. I missed this thanks
undefined says So it should be nitro-pruned.tar
undefined says Np, because when select the tx, the sequencer don't know how much actually gas it will use.
undefined says Correct. So in theory if I set 33M it get pushed to the next block always right? because cap is set to 32M
undefined says Yes, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/sequencer.go#L909
undefined says And this cap is variable right? Because I noticed that sometimes, during high load period, even if gas limit is over 32M, it get included with other txs without waiting for the next block.
undefined says like this
undefined says 
undefined says 2 days ago, transfer eth mainnet. But the transfer still hasn't happened.  what should I do?
undefined says Hey everyone, new to the discord, but developing in arb for a bit. How are y'all doing?
undefined says I have a (probably amateurish) question: how many blocks is it considered safe to wait for confirmation in arbitrum one? I read somewhere that data is sent to eth mainnet every few minutes, but there wasn't a clear cut answer as to how often.

In more clear terms, I'm running a subgraph that's indexing my smart contracts deployed in arbitrum one, and I want to know how many blocks behind the tip I should be querying the data to ensure it is final.

Cheers and thanks in advance for any answers
undefined says That is because the gas limit is for both l1 and l2, it will sub l1 gas first to get the compute gas.
undefined says so is the 32M hardcoded?
undefined says You mean withdraw eth to mainnet? You need wait 8 days and then back to bridge ui to claim, next time if you don’t want to wait you can use 3rd party bridge: https://portal.arbitrum.io/?chains=arbitrum-one&categories=bridge
undefined says It’s chain config
undefined says means?
undefined says It’s hardcode, but can also be changed by reset the config.
undefined says ah ok, by ArbOwner
undefined says You can call eth_getBlockByNumber with safe or finalize tag, it will return the first safe/finalized block, there is no fixed block number like l1 that we can consider it as finalized
undefined says is there a way to compute this by my own?
undefined says You can call gasEstimateComponents of nodeinterface, it has gasEstimateForL1 return.
undefined says and then I subtract that from 32M
undefined says Thanks. How would that look on a client like ethers?
undefined says Or if I’m doing something like “getLogs” and I want to know the latest safe “toBlock”?
undefined says provider.getBlock("finalized") or provider.getBlock("safe"): https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider--block-methods
undefined says subtract from the tx gaslimit
undefined says ok so:
My real gas limit = 35M - gasEstimateForL1

then I check if this is lower ir greater than 32M
undefined says Awesome, thanks a bunch.

Is there a difference between finalized and safe or are they aliases?
undefined says https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/ethereum-commitment-levels
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs is this correct?
undefined says Yes, or you can say  32m should be blockGasLeft.
undefined says ok thanks. Is calling the ArbGasInfo contract the only way to retrieve these data? Or is there a json rpc api?
undefined says What data? blockGasLeft? This can’t be retrieved, but the total block gas limit is 32m
undefined says `gasEstimateComponents`. Is calling the NodeInterface method the only way to get it?
undefined says Theoretically, you can also use ArbGasInfo.getL1BaseFeeEstimate() or ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei() (and get the second element), and then multiply that result for the size of your calldata, but this is not as accurate as NodeInterface.gasEstimateComponents . Not sure if you've seen this page, but it goes over how to estimate gas, its components, and different ways of doing so => https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says yes already checked thank you.
undefined says I'm trying to fetch blocks with the `BlockByNumber` function but by using the geth (github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) I get `transaction type not supported`.
So I've modified my go.mod to include `replace github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum => github.com/offchainlabs/go-ethereum v0.0.0-20230710215110-3725b60e0494 `but now I get the error `missing required field 'EffectiveGasPrice' in transaction` on older blocks (for example: 690000) while it works fine for newer blocks (111180000).
Is there a way to support both transactions types instead of having to manually fetch older blocks with one client and newer blocks with another?
Thank you!
undefined says Hey! I would need a bit more of context to fully understand what you're trying to accomplish, but be aware that Classic transaction receipts are different than Nitro transaction receipts (after block 22207818 on Arbitrum One).
Both are handled correctly in the nitro node though. If you call eth_getTransactionReceipt on any of the transactions of those blocks (obtained with eth_getBlockByNumber), you get the right results.
undefined says 
undefined says Oof, my message got deleted by the bot, lol.
Anyway, I'm only trying to fetch blocks to then scan through its transactions for those sent by my addresses, nothing fancy.
Are you saying that the nitro node (github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) offers the same functionalities as Geth's "ethclient" package? I couldn't find a similar package, would you mind telling me what package is that?
undefined says Yeap, exactly. Nitro is based off geth, with customisations for Arbitrum. You can see instructions on how to run your own node here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node
Or you can use Arbitrum's public RPCs or any other RPC from a third party provider => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says btw I'm not interacting with my nitro node via the console, my plan is to use go packages integrated in my program.
I already run my own nitro node.
That's why I don't understand how "github.com/offchainlabs/go-ethereum" isn't already accounting for the different block/transactions type pre/post nitro.
For example, Geth's `BlockByNumber` function works with every block by accounting for differences in blocks before/after a fork
undefined says I'm not that familiar with calling RPC methods directly from a go script, but several things that come to mind:
- Use the latest released version of nitro and import the go-ethereum module from there (there's a folder go-ethereum in the root of that repo) => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.0.14
- OR use the latest offchainlabs/go-ethereum package => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.0.2
- Try to send RPC requests to your node instead of calling directly the go-ethereum script (not 100% sure, but could be a workaround)

Let me know if any of those solutions work for you, please
undefined says 1. that folder is empty and does not contain any package
2. using `go get` the package downloaded is ` github.com/offchainlabs/go-ethereum v0.0.0-20230710215110-3725b60e0494` which is what I've been using, and `BlockByNumber `has the problem as described in the messages above
3. that's what using the function in a program does though, requesting data directly to the node through RPC
undefined says Mine doesn't seem like an hard or strange task to do though, how would you go about when coding a program that fetches Arbitrum blocks? That's what I'm trying to do. I have no problem doing that for Mainnet as Geth's `BlockByNumber `function works as expected, it's the Arbitrum client not working as I expect it should
undefined says I've asked internally some of my colleagues who work with Go. I'll get back once I get a reply from them. In the meantime:
1. Not sure if go installs submodules by default, but go-ethereum is a submodule of the nitro package
2. That's the right version, yeah
undefined says Thank you.
> Not sure if go installs submodules by default, but go-ethereum is a submodule of the nitro package
I'm still learning all these strange things happening with packages for forked repositories, so I definitely might be doing something wrong, but it seems like you can't `go get` the go-ethereum submodule from the nitro repository, but it seems like it just references the other repository anyway (github.com/offchainlabs/go-ethereum), so I doubt it would change anything for those errors even if it worked.
undefined says Hi! Super excited about Arbitrum Stylus and Orbit, wanted to ask if it is possible to look at some Stylus code and to ask if there is a timeline for its launch @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs
undefined says Hey, we haven’t open source it yet, and stylus will go alive in the end of this year
undefined says we'll open up the code and launch a testnet in the coming weeks, stay tuned!
undefined says How do i access sequencer feed?
is there any recommended package to access it?
undefined says @SQLEinstein
undefined says thanks!
undefined says Also: https://offchain.medium.com/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22

And tune in for any #📢︱announcements regarding that 🙂
undefined says It would be nice if we could have some documentation or guidelines to help us hit the ground running when stylus is released.
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says how can I read the sequencer feed msg after decoding it with base64 using your arbitrum sdk?
undefined says we will definitely have docs ready along with the testnet launch; glad you're excited about it; once it's released please give any feedback you have on docs and sdk!
undefined says you can find more details here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed it references a Golang implementation but feel free to reimplement in whatever language you prefer
undefined says Thanks. I remember somewhere here someone mentioning a lib or something in javsscript to do so. Are you fimiliar with any similar solution?
undefined says we don't provide one, someone may have written one, but I'm not familiar with it; maybe check npm?
undefined says awesome thank you! also wanted to ask if Stylus and Orbit are planned to work together
undefined says if you will be able to create a Stylus enabled L3
undefined says yes, initial support for stylus will be on Orbit L3s as support for L2 will require governance approval for the upgrade and will take a bit more time
undefined says sounds awesome! really looking forward to it
undefined says Hey is it possible to withdraw ETH not via a bridge but via the smart contract if so can anyone refer me to some documentation?
undefined says yes, you can use the TypeScript SDK for that, see EthBridger class in the SDK, which will call the bridge contract directly: https://developer.arbitrum.io/sdk/classes/assetBridger_ethBridger.EthBridger#withdraw

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/
undefined says Thanks appreciate the help
undefined says If I deploy a smart contract on Arbitrum Nova that has a function which returns `block.number`, which block number will it return?
undefined says L1 block number: https://developer.arbitrum.io/time#ethereum-block-numbers-within-arbitrum
undefined says gm @Gims , if you haven't found yet a solution to your problem, can you try with this commit of the offchainlabs/go-ethereum package? 
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum/tree/d52739e6d54f2ea06146fdc44947af3488b89082

The latest stable version of nitro (v2.0.14) is using that one. The master version might have issues introduced in the latest changes.
undefined says not sure why automod is blocking my message, anyway here's a screenshot of it, ahah
undefined says Great! Good to know. Yes, let me know if you try my suggestion and it works 💪 
Thank you
undefined says Is there anywhere I can look to find the repercussions to a false challenge, and general challenging logistics in code or text either is good
undefined says Thanks, I wasn't sure if this appllied for Arbitrum Nova as well
undefined says Also, I understand no transactions have been challenged before, but is there a place where you are able to view challenges if one happens
undefined says Hey all. Wondering:

Have you noticed any areas of friction around accessing data, creating data, querying data, or the tooling used for these things? 

Doing some research to try and support the community.

undefined says I am setup arb nitro one use docker but there is an error when get balance, balance does not change when I use meta mask to send coin to another wallet
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I have a problem with Arb Full node 
1)_ I have already setup Arb Full node Docker for L2 (discord not allow to post link here)
2)_ I have already setup Nethermind Docker for L1  (discord not allow to post link here)

Everything seem be good, i can start those dockers and all necessary services also, such as: 8545 (netherum), 8547 (arb one)
2.1_ The first problem is: I can not create new account address (personal_newAccount) via Arb L2 w/ port 8547. I get error 
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "error": {
        "code": -32000,
        "message": "local keystore not used"
    }
}
Then, i have used netherum (L1 to create account w/ the same method (w/ port 8545) , it's work well. But i got the second problem as below:
2.2_ When i transfer token/eth, the balance can't update, that's mean i can not get its balance. But Arbscan shown correct of Balance, Txt transactions are also shown correct, networks already confirmed..... But i got balance still is zero.

Thanks so much for your help!
undefined says is there anyway to view every transaction whcih has been challenged?
undefined says From which wallet?
undefined says Currently no challenge happens on arb1, but you can see the challenge logic here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/b20fa84a0b3024668b9c2bc65871a7b142443c63/contracts/src/challenge
undefined says Although we don’t have challenges on arb1, but we do have challenges on arb based on ethw, which you can see Lee’s tweet here: https://twitter.com/plasmapower0/status/1588206033654145024?s=46&t=PQpIW5UWGjzdQfEgWr0wdA
undefined says Yes, we have analysis tools list on our portal, you can see them here: https://portal.arbitrum.io/?categories=analytics
undefined says Do you finish syncing? What is the block height of your node now?
undefined says Hey, that is might because your node doesn’t sync to the latest state so you can’t see the latest balance, and for the local key store, I don’t think we support it now, but you can use a lot of tools to generate it like you mentioned, also you can use web3js or ethersjs to generate keystone too.
undefined says How can we sync to the latest state? Is it related to the configurarion?  Thanks for help
undefined says It will automatically sync, you can see the log to check the synced block number
undefined says It can’t sync , i dont know why 😦
undefined says can you help us ? @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says What is your node’s logs now?
undefined says i have two services
_ arb 
_ nethereum 
i'm sr, but which are you mentioning ?

undefined says Thank you! Are there any themes you're seeing, any things that might support the broader ecosystem of devs around data plugins, pipelines, accessing and querying blockchain info?
undefined says Do you have any specific one in mind? Cause we have support for the big ones like Nansen and Dune
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says wondering broadly about the ecosystem. any ways in which developers experience managing, storing, updating, querying data could be improved? any current limitations in the tech stack with respect to data? 

trying to find ways to support people with our database, Tableland.
undefined says Any efforts for The Graph to support arbitrum nova?
undefined says Is there a general rule on arbitrum for how much calldata costs in practice (average case)? Like does adding another uint to calldata tend to be cheaper than an sload?
undefined says Actually nothing Arbitrum specific for that. Very similar to Ethereum, cost of storing indexed data, and querying data is the main barrier
undefined says Not a general rule. This completely depends on the tx, but mainly calldata is the most expensive resource on Arbitrum, cause it needs you pay cost of batch posting the compressed version of txs back to L1
undefined says Is it possible for the proposer to prevent from coming back to the L1? I know that the sequencer can be bypass but I don't really understand how work proposer
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Super, thank you @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs 🙏 
Wondering about these next questions:

1. Can you detail the costs tied to data storage and queries? Any cost-reduction strategies in mind?
2. What tools are devs using for data management on Arbitrum? Any gaps in these tools?
3. How do storage and query costs scale with data size or transaction volume? Any scalability issues?
4. How is data security managed on Arbitrum? Any areas needing more security?
5. How smooth is data transfer between Ethereum, Arbitrum, and other L2s? Any challenges?
6. What challenges do devs face when handling data on Arbitrum? Any ways to improve their experience?
7. Any specific partnerships or collaborations that could enhance data management on Arbitrum?
undefined says Your question is a bit vague. You have the option to send a transaction without involving the Sequencer, but it will require approximately 24 hours to be incorporated into the Inbox: https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job
undefined says A significant portion of transaction costs in Arbitrum is attributed to the L1 gas cost, which is essentially the expense of putting your transaction's calldata on the Ethereum network. To reduce gas costs, one approach is to employ data compression methods. This involves compressing data when storing large amounts on-chain, thereby lowering storage expenses. Additionally, it is advisable to develop smart contracts and applications with gas efficiency in mind. This can be achieved by minimizing unnecessary computations, loops, and storage operations to reduce overall gas consumption. 
Also, when building on Arbitrum, one of the main challenges is working around the fraud proof delay, especially when interacting between the L2 chain (Arbitrum) and the L1 chain (Ethereum). Transactions are asynchronous and will only take effect once the rollup block has been confirmed. Apart from this delay and the need for interoperability with Ethereum, most aspects of development within Arbitrum are similar to Ethereum, except for a small set of operations that function differently, as documented in: https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support
undefined says Arb One has a 32 million gas limit per block. Your transaction could potentially consume more gas than what is allocated in a single block.
undefined says I think that normally means you don't have enough funds for the deployment but I could be wrong
undefined says can someone help me with the write contract feature on arbiscan
undefined says Seems that network is halted 👀
undefined says we back
undefined says I saw a emergincy withdrall 1 day and 11 hours ago and i be live it was haulted 14 days ago
undefined says any suggestions on claiming the arb?
undefined says Hey yeah for an approximately 10 minute period, networking issues with the sequencer prevented the submission of transactions. We're investigating further, but we believe the issue is now resolved.
undefined says Please ask this question is #📬︱support, they'll be able to guide you.
undefined says Apologies if this has already been asked before, but how does Arbitrum plan to store state post 4844 with regards to sync ? That is, today all state can be reconstructed from L1, but once data starts to be published to the side-car data blobs, they expire after a specified amount of time. If there are resources about this, I’d be grateful if anyone can point it to me.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs Circling back to this; can that transaction I did on Arbitrum Goerli be used at all toe estimate how much it should cost to do the same transaction on Arbitrum One?
undefined says will there be a post mortem report about the issue?
undefined says In theory, you can do this, but it kinda difficult. The difference of gas usage is l1 component, if you can estimate your l1 component on arb1, you can add it to the l2 component you estimate on arb goerli. To do this, you need to call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/1b10711dc5f2eeefebc8c9f07d5c5f580534f703/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L84 both arb1 and arb goerli, and you can add the gasEstimateForL1 returned from arb1 to (gasEstimate - gasEstimateForL1) returned from arb goerli.
undefined says thanks, could you provide some more example or explanation on what you mean by  outside evm context? really appreciate that.
undefined says Hey, they are operations that are not triggered by a specific smart contract instruction (or OPCODE). You may see, for example, transfers of the internal L1 and/or L2 fees outside the EVM context, in those beforeEVMtransfers and afterEVMtransfers fields of the trace.
undefined says appreciate that a lot. So can I say beforeEVMtransfers refer to operation happen before a specific smart contract instruction execute?
undefined says and afterEVMtransfers fields record the operation happens after a specific smart contract instruction execute?
undefined says Before and after all instructions execute
undefined says Hey there, I had a query about how TVL works? 

For instance, on Arbitrum's website, TVL* is said to be $5.97B as of 18th July ? But some 3rd party blogs/websites claim different numbers. So I was curious to know how this value was calculated ? (Things like - do the arbitrum validator nodes' stakes, which are run by arbitrum also count in ?)
undefined says Hey arb dev community - is there any public plans or time lines for when or how Arbitrum will leverage EIP-4844? I cant find anything on the site about the change and it looks like it will be making it into maininet Q4/Q1
undefined says It depends on the website you're looking at. Generally, TVL would account for value of assets locked in escrow contracts on L1 (that's how L2beat calculates it), but it can differ. For example, iirc DefiLlama aggregates the TVL of all protocols in the network, so if assets are not locked in any protocol, it won't count towards that network's TVL.
undefined says There hasn't been any official announcement about EIP-4844 yet, but it will be published in all public channels: Twitter, Discord, Telegram, ...
undefined says 
undefined says oh gotcha, may I know how Arbitrum does it to get the number on the website ? The $5.97B one?
undefined says That's taken from L2beat
undefined says cool, thank you for the information!
undefined says 
undefined says Idk why my message was warned, but I keep seeing these warns and not sure what is causing it:
undefined says 
undefined says In general it's not a problem to be worried about. Are you sending any transactions that might cause this high gas?
undefined says If I turn on debug logs would they show what call is causing this warn?
undefined says Maybe with --log-level=4 or 5 (that's a lot of info though)
undefined says I just set up fullnode. I look in the log, there is a new log every 1 second. So are blocks also updated every 1 second?

undefined says And we realised that our latest block is usually 2 blocks behind the actual latest block. Is there any solution to this?
undefined says 
undefined says Based on the arbitrum docs (I can't post a link...):

> ⚠️ Note: There is no protocol level incentive to run an Arbitum full node. 

I know the sequencer gets paid some amount of the fee, but I thought the Arbitrum full node got paid a little as well? Does 100% of the gas fees go to the sequencer?
undefined says Is it true that the security council can update the protocol instantly and theoretically rug the users?
undefined says notice how it's not printing every block to the screen, ie it skips 4 block numbers once a second (see l2Block); your node is probably perfectly up to speed, but not everything logs to the console; Arb One actually posts up to 4 blocks per second; you should query your node with a JSONRPC request to check the exact block against a precise timestamp
undefined says hey Patrick! there is currently no fee provided to ArbOne validators; they have a bond posted and if they make an invalid fraud proof claim they would lose that bond; Nova validators on the other hand, receive a small portion of the L2 fees on that chain; currently 100% of all other gas fees go directly to the Arb DAO; Offchain Labs operates the only sequencer for now, but we are looking to open that up in the future; all of this is subject to change based on various DAO votes/initiatives
undefined says a supermajority (9 of 12) of the security council could in theory upgrade the protocol; however, in practice this is not going to happen unless there's a security flaw that needs to be addressed. The security council members are doxxed and have long, solid reputations in the blockchain space, the members are also distributed among multiple teams in the Arb ecosystem. They are also contractually and legally obligated to abide by the DAO constitution
undefined says Who is the best person to connect with regarding partnerships?
undefined says Thank you for your clear answer 🙌
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs Can i msg you regarding some technicalities about token bridging & using custom gateways on Arbitrum. I hope you can help!
undefined says You can just ask here
undefined says OK so the solidity docs say that for scalability reasons, you can only access the previous 256 blockhashes. Is this still true for arbitrum? If not does anyone know how many hashes back you can access?

Working on a small project and want to use future blockhashes relative to an original TX as a means of Oracleless randomness
undefined says partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Arbitrum still can query previous 256 blockhashes.
undefined says Where can I find the identities of the security council members? Also, in the future elections, the new candidates will have to be doxxed as well?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup#governance-powers-breakdown
undefined says Is it possible for them to be re-elected?
undefined says Yes, https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1682663180147777536?s=46&t=PQpIW5UWGjzdQfEgWr0wdA
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs 
Arbitrum is currently known as PoS. I have a few questions about this!
1. Can anyone become a Validator?
2. Is there a minimum amount I must stake to become a Validator?
3. How much are validators rewarded per year? (Inflation rate and reward pool, detailed mechanism)
4. Can I do delegate staking?
5. Is there a dashboard or scanner website related to Validator or Staking?
6. Is there a guide document related to validator node operation and staking?
undefined says And only 256? because on arb unless im mistaken that works out to much less IRL time
undefined says Arb is not really proof of stake. Arbitrum works on fraud proofs, not stake-based consensus. L1 Ethereum is Proof of Stake, however, and it does inherit security from L1 (since the fraud proof resolution process is invoked by smart contracts on L1):
1.
undefined says 1. Not currently, it is whitelisted, but we are working on proposals for opening it up
2. Right now, as mentioned, it's a permissioned thing. The current set of validators have posted a bond, not a stake. They lose that bond if they make an invalid fraud proof claim.
3. Currently ArbOne validators are not rewarded. Nova validators receive a small portion of l2 fees, but I don't know the figures offhand
4-6. No, since there is no staking as a concept on L2 and other details mentioned

as mentioned, we are looking to enable permissionless validation; many of these details will then be subject to change by the DAO at the time, including rules for fees
undefined says If so, is there no exist arbitrum staking?
Or staking is just pool  program?
undefined says there is no staking on L2; the set of currently permissioned validators on Nova receive a small fee for running validators
undefined says Okay, thank you for answers!
undefined says Hey there!
undefined says @Ana 💙 Arbitrum  We have big telegram bot ecosystem and we want to add Arbitrum to our ecosystem free.. Allready we added bsc and eth.
undefined says I have a question , If i have TokenA on ethereum and a staking contract on Ethereum but i have a reward token on Arbitrum ( TokenB ) can i Stake tokenA on eth with the staking smart contract and get reward tokenB on Arbitrum ?
undefined says Not without very extensive code at which point you would just be better bridging over token A and having people stake on arbitrum
undefined says I am trying to do a withdrawal using the write contract feature and not sure what one to use and suggestions how to withdraw my arb this way?
undefined says Hey,
Could you please drop an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says Yeah you can have a design for it. To give you a big picture: you can use retryable tickets (https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging) to send L1 to L2 messages whenever you want to send a message between a contract on L1 to a contract on L2.
You can have a contract on L1, in which users can call a function whenever they wants to get their rewards. On that function you can send L1 to L2 message and send a message to your L2 contract which can gives your users the rewards on L2 in Token B
undefined says what contract is it?
undefined says Sent you the contract directly
undefined says .
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs you get my message?
undefined says thank you , i will read this article and try to implement it and see if it works , it will be also helpful if you have a tutorial how to implement that in code
undefined says I really cannot figure out how can i create a staking smart contract on etheruem that reward people a token on arbitrum , and what arbitrum is used in the first place ? sorry i am new into L1 to L2

please if someone from Arbitrum team can give me a solidity example that would be very helpful
undefined says Pls im trying to deploy on the arbitrum blockchain but I cant seem to find faucet 
Pls how do i get arbitrum test faucet for testing purposes ??
undefined says how do i go about it anyone ?
undefined says Do you need arbitrum test token or ETH on Arbitrum?
undefined says Goerli L1 Faucets
https://goerlifaucet.com/
https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/
https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/
https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/
https://goerli-faucet.com/


Try these faucets to see if they are still available.

Once you get Goerli ETH you can bridge them into Arbitrum testnet via the official bridge: https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Hey, we have several tutorials regarding L1-to-L2 messaging. This one, for example, creates a contract on both layers and sends a message from L1 to L2 => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter
undefined says Hey. I am not sure where I should ask but I hope it finds You well. My name is Philip and I am working with CarmineOptions AMM. We're crypto options AMM built on top of the Starknet. Our product is on Mainnet already and audited. We're looking to expand to other chains to improve possibilities for the users/community. Who I can connect with to talk about this issue?
undefined says Hey can you drop an email to parternships@offchainlabs.com?
undefined says Hey,
You can provide some ETH goerli from faucets, and then bridge them into Arbitrum Goerli using Arbitrum bridge https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Is there a way for me to add an ERC20 token to the official lists such that my users can easily find it in the bridge UI?
undefined says Thanks 🙂
undefined says If you add it to uniswap list, it'd be added to our list automatically
undefined says How often do reorgs happen? Like, once a day/once a month?
undefined says I see. We'll try that, thanks!
undefined says 
undefined says Just to confirm, are you referring to the Uniswap Labs Default list on the Token Lists website?
undefined says Who is best to position Orbit chains?
undefined says yes! as Mehdi said, we don’t actively maintain a list now so if you get on coinmarketcap / uniswap’s list our list will be updated accordingly as our lists depend on those.
undefined says Deep L1 reorgs are pretty unlikely in POS
undefined says Please drop an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com
undefined says 
undefined says Does eth_sendRawTransaction sends to the sequencer directly? Or do I need to set up the node in order for to be sent to the sequencer RPC url?
undefined says eth_sendRawTransaction can be sent directly to the Sequencer at https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Yes I mean when I use eth_sendRawTransaction I can't choose who I send it to. Is it forwarded to the sequencer (the url you gave me) by default ?
undefined says You can do that with the parameter --node.forwarding-target=https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/rpc to forward sendRawTransactions to the sequencer.
But you have to note that we don't allow direct connections to the sequencer so that it doesn't get overloaded. That endpoint will first go through a prechecker node which will confirm the transactions are valid before sending them on to the sequencer.
undefined says is there a list of live arbitrum projects somewhere? looking to join a project or help around as a dev. have prior experience in eth & other chains :arbitrumkitty:
undefined says yea you can find a list of live projects on arb here:
https://portal.arbitrum.io
undefined says i am facing lag issues when running our hardhat test suite on arbitrum goerli. does anyone else face similar issue?
undefined says the test wont exit itself for a pretty long time, even after executing the last line of the test.
undefined says Hey, is that related to a specific request you're sending to a node? Or just the hardhat test suite? 
For the former, we would need to see the actual request you're sending, for troubleshooting.
For the latter, you might get better support in hardhat's discord server.
undefined says i think its actually specific to my project tbh. i tried to do the same on a newer project with newer dependencies, and it doesnt really hang or lag. i also tried running the test suite that comes with the hardhat sample project and that too works fine
i was wondering if someone has already seen anything similar and fixed it
undefined says 0xd9b32fae351191d0fe51fb926d372628f7b0d7b95b91c46f58c8d3a36fa96f8f

i cant locate this transaction on arbiscan
undefined says gm! is arbitrum goerli testnet going to move to sepolia after goerli is deprecated on dec 31 2023?
undefined says If Arbitrum ever moves to Sepolia it will be a new testnet chain, nothing will be migrated from Goerli.
In any case, the Foundation will announce it if it ever deploys the new testnet.
undefined says Can you provide some more context on what you are trying to do?
undefined says yea that's what i thought too, can't move the whole goerli L2 state right? it will be a different L2
undefined says Yeap, exactly
undefined says this goerli deprecation is going to screw up everyone's L2s 😬 arbitrum/optimism/zkEVM/zkSync/etc., all are on goerli
undefined says i hope they extend it by 1 more year at least
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs So what is faster? Sending a transaction to my node or sending it to my node with this argument. I am kind of confused.
undefined says 
undefined says someone said they got away w fraud on this transaction so i wanted to look into details to see how i could see other transactions that got away w fraud and analyze the security of arbitrum
undefined says It looks like the transaction doesn't exist on any Arbitrum or Ethereum networks
undefined says Can I create a Gnosis Safe Multi-Sig Wallet for Arbitrum Nova?
undefined says it's possible to deploy a Safe on Nova, but it's not currently officially supported in their UI. a factory contract does exist that can deploy Safes, but it's fairly technical to work with. I don't know when Safe intends to support Nova officially (hopefully soon)
undefined says Thank you very much - Are you aware of any other multi sig wallet which supports Nova?
undefined says I heard on the grapevine that bls12-381 operations like pairing are now available as precompiles, though I see nothing in the documentation. Can anyone confirm if this is the case or could link me to more info?
undefined says may want to look into either Sequence (https://sequence.xyz/welcome), Etherspot (https://etherspot.io/), or Biconomy (https://www.biconomy.io/sdk)
undefined says only what's supported on L1 is currently supported and BLS support will only be added when L1 does; when Stylus support rolls out (https://offchain.medium.com/hello-stylus-6b18fecc3a22), you'll be able to make your own precompiles via Rust, C or C++ code
undefined says where can i get a list of all tokens bridgeable btwn ethereum and arbitrum using the native arbitrum bridge?
undefined says any ERC20 on L1 is bridgeable to Arbitrum; and any L2 native token can define a reverse gateway for bridging the other direction
undefined says Has anyone implemented a batch_transaction decoder for type 3 transactions emmited by sequencer ? Also what is the different between L2 txns of type 4 and type 3? thanks !
undefined says Can someone explain to me what are the purpose of those flags ?

--node.sync-monitor.coordinator-msg-lag
 --node.sync-monitor.block-build-lag
 --node.sync-monitor.block-build-sequencer-inbox-lag
undefined says This bold stuff is pretty cool. If I understand it correctly, it's basically allowing any actor to submit a fraud proof without the issue of a delay attack.

I am curious though why arbitrum has put so much effort into maintaining an optimistic rollup setup when ZK seems superior and avoids the issue of needing to submit a fraud proof entirely.

Wouldn't that development energy have been better spent on getting a zk prover?
undefined says Is it true that if there is a challenge in the current protocol that no new transactions can be processed? Or is it only the transactions within the disputed batch?
undefined says I am trying to write a smart contract that that sends outBoundTransfer() functions calls to the Arbitrum: L1 Gateway Router. I was wondering what the fields _maxGas, _gasPriceBid, and _data were and how to populate the correctly.
undefined says Hey yup:
--node.sync-monitor.coordinator-msg-lag : allowed lag between local and remote messages 
 --node.sync-monitor.block-build-lag:  allowed lag between messages read and blocks built 
 --node.sync-monitor.block-build-sequencer-inbox-lag: allowed lag between messages read from sequencer inbox and blocks build
undefined says Do you want to do it on-chain or offchain?
undefined says Hey,
We've explained the challenges that ZK-rollups facing and why we choose to progress the optimistic rollup path for now:
https://medium.com/offchainlabs/optimistic-rollups-the-present-and-future-of-ethereum-scaling-60fb9067ae87
undefined says Cool I'll have a look though EVM compatibility is no longer a reason against.
undefined says when I send a tx via my node, I get this message:** INFO [08-04|20:09:39.747] Submitted transaction**
What does it mean? When the sequencer has received my tx and is going to process it?
undefined says Yeah thanks I saw the doc 😅 but i don't understand whats does "lag" mean

And btw can we use "--node.seq-coordinator.enable" ?
undefined says Does the arbitrum node makes a lot of calls to the Ethereum 1 node? I want to run a full arbitrum node so I might use infura to connect eth to my arb node
undefined says how does arbos handle  PREVRANDAO? can anyone point me to impl?
undefined says it's still just DIFFICULTY on Arbitrum, which is 1
undefined says I had a chance to read the piece. On the topic of cost, is zkEVM's proof of efficiency when operated at scale less than an order of magnitude more expensive than fraud proofs?

Yes zkEVM requires running a node for proving, and to be competitive specialize infrastructure, but anyone can run this.

EVM compatibility as I said is 100% for zkEVM so that's no longer an issue. I don't think visibility is an issue for zkEVM.

Finality is less time for zkEVM if it's operating at scale. In other words batches are processed as soon as it becomes profitable to do so which requires enough trxs on the L2 to cover the gas and incentive fees.

Is trustless liveness not something they solved as well?

And of course bridging is done at the pace of finality on the L1 once the trx is processed.
undefined says From another angle, if Arbitrum stays optimistic and this bold thing allows anyone to submit fraud proofs AND the 12 people who basically have full control over the network are removed then from a decentralization standpoint I do agree it's arguably not much different.

There's also the topic of single sequencer which zkEVM has tried to tackle, but there are still issues there and personally I like the fact that it's more difficult to front run on single sequencer. Of course there's still back running.
undefined says Though I do agree there's a counter argument for giving up the 12 person msig. With the BNB bridge hack and the recent Vyper compiler issue it's clear not everything has been worked out. Also the geth vulnerability that the Telos audit uncovered was also something someone else probably should've already found if they were looking hard enough.
undefined says > EVM compatibility is 100% for zkEVM

That's not accurate. Take `CREATE2` as an example, which in zk systems often produces addresses that differ from EVM compatible chains like Arbitrum One. The economics of opcodes aren't equivalent either, in that the true cost (not subsidized) to execute and prove different opcodes have different relationships than in the EVM. According to the EVM, an `ADD` is 3 gas and Keccak is 30 (plus 6 gas a word). But the true cost Keccak in a zk system is far greater than 10x an `ADD`. This causes UX, tooling, and/or subsidy needs.
undefined says It's def fine to say zk systems have improved in compatibility, but 100% is a really high bar. And there's teams that def care about `CREATE2` having the right address. It's just going to depend on your use case if zk technologies can serve your needs or serve them without needing you to put in additional work
undefined says 
undefined says 2 questions i'm intrested to learn...
is the L2 used in arbitrum something they developed entirely new? (BFT, consensus and all..)
were there rollback that happened in L2? if so how many and when... is there any public infotmation about it?
undefined says hey guys is arbiscan goerli down  ?
undefined says No it's not. Is it not working on your end?
undefined says its taking time to index , network congestion ig , some trx not showing up
undefined says How about now? If it still not show up, could you send me the tx?
undefined says Are there any news on the progress of implementing MEV system on arbitrum similar to what is already implemented in ethereum? I know the idea was announced a couple of months ago
undefined says Works ser thanks
undefined says Thank you for pointing out those differences I was not aware of this. That is a big difference regarding keccak. Is arbitrum going to introduce some real tooling to level the playging field if there is a sequencer failure and people need to force include trxs?

It basically sounds like to me everyone is going to be swapping for native ETH and bridging for force inclusion. All other bridges rely on events that will likely not function in the case of sequencer failure.
undefined says We have working on a app and are using Arbitrum. When creating tx's on the backend a lot of times we get some wierd insufficient funds error. Although the account has over $5 in eth. Can anyone help with this? i am using ethers 6.6. And when it does success it takes like .20 cents in tx fees
undefined says i tried setting type 2 txs like on ethereum with maxPriorityFeePerGas and maxFeePerGas and read this is not something you do on arbitrum, Then added a gasLimit to the transaction which didn't help. We had some success with just calling the contract function outright without any gas settings. It worked for a while but now i am starting the errors again
undefined says What is the gas limit you estimate?
undefined says Can you tell me when the Stylus update will be released? I am very interested!!
undefined says We will have announcements in a few weeks.
undefined says Okay i got it.

I understand that the biggest change in Arbitrum stylus is that it can be developed in any programming language. Are there any other changes in terms of fees besides this??
undefined says i removed the estimate gas since it didn't do anything. It would estimate gas a ridiculous number. And the tx would take 20 cents
undefined says Usually how much gas your tx will cost (Same type tx), and tx gas cost will be different due to l1 gas price changed.
undefined says yes but. When tx goes throw with success, they cost maybe 0.20, 0.30 cents but require a total of maybe 4-5 dollars in eth on the account
undefined says maybe i am doing something wrong. The estimate gas was giving a big number, in reality the gas costs was .20 cent. Could you help in providing a good workflow on placing a transaction with ether  6.6 that will not fail?
undefined says Sir, can I know what contract address of Arbitrum one?  I just want to try to deploy my first contract on Arbitrum one, but I still confused what contract of Arbitrum one provide to become public address on my contract, Example

`Contract zoro {
       address public oneAddress =* I dont have a clue*;
       address one;`
undefined says arbitrum one has no single contract address; to deploy a contract to arbitrum one, use a public arbitrum one RPC and deploy your contract to it like you would to any other evm-compatible chain — does that help?
undefined says Is there any update on when we can deploy contracts to arbitrum compiled for an EVM version with PUSH0?
undefined says I recently went through the BoLD paper (whatever's available on GH) and tried to wrap my head round it. Overall it seems pretty cool what's possible with this but there are a few things I don't understand. I'd appreciate if someone could help me with it,

1) What fundamentally changed or what was the breakthrough that enabled this, which was earlier not the case? (TBH the bisection protocol seemed pretty similar to me, so I got a little confused)
2) How are these bisections done in parallel in the new model ? The given example in the paper clearly highlights how a 1v1 challenge would proceed, but I'm unsure how the same is applicable if there are let's say 100s (hypothetical) of rival level 0 edges competing against each other. These somehow happen to run in parallel now right ? Which didn't happen before.
3) How does Layer 1 (ethereum) resolve the final op-code level conflict ? (single step proof part) - This seems like the main coupling between L1 and L2 security right ? Any details on this would be awesome
4) The section 3.10.1 mentions a possible extension where the honest parties are _reimbursed_ the transaction fee. Made me curious, is there no reward/bonus what so ever apart from the refund of the gas fee for them ? Is this the same in current implementation ?   


Thanks a ton!
undefined says Final gas price might vary a lot depending on when you send the transaction, mainly because of L1 pricing (as Jason mentioned). That's why estimating the transaction first will give you the best probability for your transaction to be executed. If you want to play with the estimations, so you have a better understanding of the process, you can go through these 2 pages that explain it (in a theoretical and practical way): https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas AND https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 .
undefined says No updates yet, but this will require a DAO proposal, so it might take some time to be supported.
undefined says Hey!
I'll try to answer your questions:
1) The problem with the current fraud proof system is that it allows for a special kind of attack: the delay attack. This kind of attacks prevents the chain state to be confirmed on L1 for a certain period of time (longer than the standard 7 day challenge period), which can be extended based on the amount of stake that can be spent for that. Bold prevents these delay attacks by allowing challenges to run in parallel instead of 1 vs 1.
2) Maybe the implementation example in 5.2.3 and 5.3 can help understanding this. Basically, for each edge a goroutine that uses a FSM to go through all states until confirmation. All validators can go through this process with every active edge.
3) There's a smart contract on L1 that actually executes the WASM instruction, giving out the correct result of that step, so that only the honest party will be able to win that challenge.
4) There's no extra reward/bonus in the current fraud proof system, nor will it be available in Bold out of the box. The Dao can, however, decide to develope this reward/bonus feature (of course, it would need to be designed and implemented). Bold paper proposes one way of doing it.

Hope that helps! Feel free to add any follow up to these answers.
undefined says 
undefined says mind to share the doc that state about the RPC sir?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says thank you sir 🙏
undefined says I've created Arbitrum test node, but I'm not sure how can I make web3 Py api calls pointing to this node to get block and other related information. Could you please help me with any sample code for this purpose.
undefined says I don't have a lot of experience with web3.py, but you should be able to connect to your node by specifying its address when creating the provider object: https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html
undefined says Thanks a lot for the reply!

1) Yeah, I'm familiar with the delay attack and how it can be executed in current Arbitrum challenge protocol if it were open to public instead of a whitelist. That's the part I'm trying to understand, why was current system not able to run these challenges in parallel and had to do it 1 by 1 while the newer BoLD can ?  Like ... what core principals enabled it ?
2) That explains node architecture, and how it can keep track of multiple edges in parallel and bisect/confirm them as needed. So If I understand it correctly, the challenges on-chain still run 1 v 1 independently, but now because of this node structure, a single participant is able to take part in multiple challenges simultaneously. Is that correct ? ( I think an example of a challenge with more than 2 level 0 edges would help me understand better about how these are resolved in one go).
3) Great, I was able to find the contract and check this out, it's so cool that all the WASM instructions were implemented as functions in that way there enabling their execution on L1. 
4) oh, gotcha.

Mhm that really helped, I have the followup query on 1,2 which I've mentioned above, thanks again!
undefined says Are there any resources or code that how Arbitrum will use EIP4844?
undefined says The unsafeCreateRetryableTicket call to the inbox contract of Goerli network was successful, but there is no data in the arb chain
undefined says You can check your retryable status here: https://retryable-dashboard.arbitrum.io/
undefined says We currently still don't have the public docs about this yet.
undefined says Why exist ` ArbGasInfo.getMinimumGasPrice` on Arbitrum? (0.1 gwei or 0.01 gwei)
undefined says There is no auction based model for transactions as there is in layer 1, transactions are ordered first come first serve; there has to be a minimum price for that reason in addition to covering the costs of running the chain, expanding features, etc.
undefined says Thanks for the comment. So am I correct in understanding that this is a minimum l2 base fee that set to cover the cost of the minimum operators (seqeuncer or poster or DAO)?
undefined says Hey!
Let's see if this helps:
The current protocol uses a sort of tournament structure built out of one-vs-one contests, so that multiple round of the tournament are needed to resolve everything. BOLD has a new way of structuring and managing the individual contests, so that even if there are multiple sub-challenges going on at the same time, they are logically independent of each other so it is easy for an honest party to conduct them in parallel. Also, in BOLD, if you're an honest party it is enough for you to watch a sub-challenge, and if someone else is making moves to defend the honest outcome in that sub-challenge, you don't need to do anything yourself (just keep watching in case they stop). In the current protocol you would have to stake on everything yourself and participate in a challenge against every individual who disagrees with you.
undefined says yes, in addition to the need to balance price predictability and longer term state growth of the chain
undefined says The gas limit for nova is 2^40 rather than the standard 30m, does that mean nova can handle much more transactions per block?
undefined says I thought so too, but arbitrum has a block time of 0.25ms(?) which is very fast anyway, so I don't think it makes sense.
undefined says The computational block limit is 32m
undefined says Hmm... yeah that makes sense.

Thank you José!
undefined says Thank you!
When will those be public? I want to know how Arbitrum integrates EIP4844, because it may affect our service so I just want to  know beforehand.
undefined says very difficult to estimate gaz on arb. please give me some code i use alchemy api and python. i read your docs but it's still unclear with me

undefined says Hey. Feel free to reach out to our engineers in #💻︱protocol
undefined says Hey, l2 is not the same network as l1 (so as to l2 and l3), so they don't share the state, you need use something like oracle to achieve that
undefined says I am looking to deploy a stablecoin on Arbitrum. Our stablecoin is already deployed on Eth Mainnet. Is there any guide on this?
undefined says We have different gateways for different usage, you can check them here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-overview
undefined says Can I clarify if bridging an existing L1 token has the same outcome as a native token on Arbitrum (similar to native USDC token on arbitrum)?
undefined says If you bridge directly, it will use standard gateway by deflaut, that gateway will automatic deploy a standard erc20 on l2. (If your token is not implemented though standard erc20 implementation, you should use other gateways)
undefined says thanks! last qn: is there any guide for setting up multisig support for a token on arbitrum?
undefined says https://safe.global/
undefined says thanks @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs !
undefined says might vary is really far off. The error says it requires 0.08 eth in gas. But only takes up 0.0004011224 after the transaction is over. This is a big big difference. This is definitely a bug. and for our use case this means i have to keep a lot of eth in user wallets and just use a small amount. And it seems sometimes this gas requirements gets higher. Do you not agree this difference is really high and this is definitely a bug?
undefined says I have to set gasLimit and gasPrice manually for Arbitrum mainnet in my app and send that with transaction so I get a correct estimate... Do you guys know what's a good average to hardcode? I can't query the current gasPrice I think so i'll have to find a good average :pepehatttip:
undefined says check DM!
undefined says Can you share a transaction and the estimation you got? (Also, how did you performed that estimation)
undefined says Keep in mind that gas might vary depending on L1 gas price. Here's a breakdown on how gas is calculated on Arbitrum in case that gives you a few ideas => https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
Can you tell me a bit more about what you're trying to accomplish so I can maybe provide further ideas? (You can DM me if you prefer)
undefined says any good news today
undefined says 
undefined says i gave a big comprehensive explanation and got warned and message was deleted. This is easy to replicate, and this issue is knows among developers i talked with but nobody knows how to fix it. Gas estimation is useless in this case if the wallet doesn't have the eth inside.
undefined says Can you send me the instructions to replicate it? (If that's the message that was filtered by the bot, you can DM that to me). Without actual data it's difficult for us to debug where the problem might be.
undefined says the steps is pretty easy. Set up a arbitrum wallet. Add about 1-2 dollars worth of eth. Use ethers off chain and create a transaction to a more complex smart contract. I use the ones on Overtime Markets.  I would say a high amount of times you will get an error, yo will need maybe 5-6, sometimes i needed 10 dollars worth of eth to do the transaction. Which in turn will only use 20 or 25 cents of eth. Our app uses their markets to place sport bets for users.

undefined says Hey Arb, I have a few questions.
1. Is `block.number` in sync with L1?
2. Does `block.hash` behave the same way as on L1? Does it return a block hash?
3. Is `block.timestamp`  useable?

These are all things mentioned in the "Migrate from Classic to Nitro" section of the docs, but there are other parts of the docs which are inconsistent, I wonder whether they are just out of date.
undefined says Hey Emilio!
Let me try to answer your questions:
1. `block.number` gives an estimate of the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction
2. `blockchash` returns a cryptographically insecure, pseudo-random hash for x within the range block.number - 256 <= x < block.number. If x is outside of this range, blockhash(x) will return 0. This includes blockhash(block.number), which always returns 0 just like on Ethereum.
3. `block.timestamp` will return the Sequencer's timestamp at which it received the transaction

undefined says You are right, that value is set by default: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/cmd/chaininfo/arbitrum_chain_info.json#L5
undefined says i need a help about bridge my Goerli L1 token to Arbitrum-Goerli
undefined says i dont want automatic generated contract on artbitrum i want to use my own contract
undefined says i should write my own gateway or there is a solution for that ?
undefined says Shoot me a message let me look it up for you
undefined says It depends on the requirements of your token, but you probably won't need your own gateway. You can use Arbitrum's generic-custom gateway. Here's a guide on how to do that => https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-generic-custom
undefined says i really cant figure what i need - i dont need standart i now this but custom or generic-custom which one i need i cant figure
undefined says That guide will help you answer your question. On most cases, generic-custom is more than enough. In any case, you have a similar guide for custom gateways just below that one.
undefined says i have 2 contracts one is on Goerli other one is on Arbitrum-Goerli i want to bridge this tokens
undefined says Yeap, that guide helps you do that exactly
undefined says but my contract dont have this 'First of all, the L1 counterpart of the token, must conform to the ICustomToken interface. This means that:'
undefined says Alright, that's a more specific question. In that case, if your L1 token is not upgradable, another possibility is to create a wrapper to make it bridgeable. Your L1 token must be able to call a specific function in the router and the gateway, to register the new L2 token.
undefined says i want to do what tether do exactly
undefined says they use L2Gateway as 0x096760f208390250649e3e8763348e783aef5562 this is a custom-gateway
undefined says Tether uses the generic-custom gateway (and that's the address of the L2 generic-custom gateway). However, they used the force registration path to register their token. That's another option that you have, although that would be only for mainnet tokens, and you would need the approval of the Arbitrum DAO. It is also explained here => https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-generic-custom#what-can-i-do-if-my-l1-token-is-not-upgradable
undefined says thank you for your help can u please send me their proposals so i can create one when i need
undefined says They didn't need a proposal because they requested it before the DAO's creation. Since Arbitrum was handed to the DAO, any administrative onchain action requires the DAO's approval now.
undefined says Hi:) 
I am looking to read more about how finality works on arbitrum. Can someone point me in the right direction? Specifically I am unclear on hard vs soft finality I read somewhere soft finality is almost instant but hard finality requires the sequencer posting the batch to L1 (how long does this take?) And does th 7 day dispute window effect finality time at all? Or is that something separate? Also does Arb finality have a name (like Eth's CasperFFG)?  thanks everyone!
undefined says Hey! You should check out https://docs.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle#2-sequencer-orders-transaction-off-chain which should hopefully answer everything 🙂
undefined says The network seems to be unstable.
undefined says Also observing it on our Arb nodes
undefined says I have some questions, who should I ask?
undefined says Ask here and anyone who know an answer to your question will definitely answer you
undefined says But my question couldn't be sent out
undefined says But my question couldn't be sent out
undefined says I have a developer question. Can anyone answer me?
undefined says You can just ask here, why your message can't send out, does your message contain any url?
undefined says yes
undefined says The thing I asked is related to the JSON rpc method
undefined says You can try add some spaces to your url, we added this rule due to so many scams.
undefined says It's useless. I have already chatted with you privately. Could you please reply
undefined says Replied
undefined says https:// goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x9fdd1c4e4aa24eec1d913fabea925594a20d43c7#writeProxyContract

which methot i should use for register my token ? 7 or 8 one
undefined says Force registeration need owner address to approve, but we have ways to bridge custom token, here is the tutorial: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/custom-token-bridging , you can see if this way meet your need
undefined says 
undefined says I ran into this error `ArbSdkError: Latest block did not contain base fee, ensure provider is connected to a network that supports EIP 1559.` when following the OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials github for token-deposit
undefined says It looks like a provider error, can you check your rpc endpoint?
undefined says what rpc endpoint should i be using? i am currently using goerli-rollup arbitrum for L2RPC and goerli infura for L1RPC
undefined says https:// goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
https:// goerli.infura.io/v3/[my api key]
undefined says It is alive now
undefined says Could you check which url throw this error? Or you can refresh your network and try again, your rpc url looks good.
undefined says turns out its the L2RPC that is throwing this error. any idea why
undefined says You can also try infura's l2 rpc
undefined says I've changed the RPC and refreshed the network but it's still giving me the same error. the error comes from the `erc20Bridger.deposit` method
undefined says Given arbitrum currently is just a single centralised sequencer, is it ever possible for reorgs to occur? If yes, is there any data on the frequency of said reorgs and how deep they are / can be on average?
undefined says But `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` ignores blockNumberMin, timestampMin, etc. It acts like `eth_sendRawTransaction`. Or maybe I doesn't cook it properly.
How to force node to respect options?
undefined says I've tested it like this, but txs executing asap without any delay.
undefined says sorry i found out it's my L1provider that causing the base fee error
undefined says Is there any info covering yesterday's sequencer outage?
undefined says ```
WARN [08-17|23:04:47.164] readData returned EOF                    url=wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed opcode=0 err=EOF

```

many of us witnessed an outage and these errors.

The incident started at 18:36 UTC. One of my nodes wasn't able to begin recovering until 19:03 UTC.
undefined says My monitoring of Arbiscan also showed it had issues processing blocks between 18:36 until about 19:20
undefined says There, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out as a Tech Lead, Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in web app development, blockchain technologies, and fintech. I am actively seeking new opportunities in my field and wanted to inquire if there might be an opportunity of interest on your end.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards!
undefined says L2 reorgs are possible, but very unlikely to happen. It has never happened up to now, iirc. For an L2 reorg to occur, the sequencer would have to be down for 24 hours, so it would potentially affect all transactions within that frame.
undefined says Are you sending it through a regular RPC node or the sequencer's endpoint?
undefined says Batchposter couldn't post batches on L1 for a while, but got resolved later and all batches were successfully posted.
L2 blocks continued to be processed during that time.
undefined says You can check #🤝︱careers
undefined says bump on this! much appreciated
undefined says where can i chat with the engineers?, i have a problem that needs to be solved
undefined says Here's the right place, just go ahead with your questions
undefined says can anyone help with this error?
undefined says I am using the arbitrum demo for token-deposit
undefined says Are you there? @undefyned
undefined says yup
undefined says Can I use delegatecall in the Arbitrum drop claim contract to call the claim() function from another contract.
undefined says when turning x coins into xx coins with the help of the Uniswap service, a problem arose due to which the funds were not where they were needed and I do not have access to them, all information was recorde
I have already talked with Uniswap, together we came to the conclusion that you have access to the address since it is displayed in scanners as the wallet of your network and I think you can help me with this without creating problems, thank you.
All recordings are live. There is also a forum where there are users with the same problem
undefined says hey guys so im working on a side project a tool basically to help me with from L2 to L1 with direct smart contract interaction, currently are there any docs referring to the contract address of the smart contract deployed on goerli? Any help is appreciated:)
undefined says You swapped a token on uniswap but didn't get the token you swapped for even when the transaction was successful. Is that what you're asking?
undefined says And there is evidence showing that something went wrong, but only you have access to it because it's your network. The funds ended up there by some kind of magic (there is a video)
undefined says Think you should send me a dm. Thanks
undefined says and also there is information on arb and eth scan
undefined says Hey, I'm trying to find the exactly definition of these two values inside Arbitrum blocks (from RPC `eth_getBlockByNumber`, not from Solidity):
- `timestamp`
- `hash`

From trying to read the code, it looks like `timestamp` can be anything the sequencer wants as long as it satifies the same restrictions that are imposed on L1 timestamps:
- new block timestamp >= prev block's timestamp
- it's not too far from the real timestamp
However, that doesn't explain why there are many duplicate timestamps for blocks. All I can find is `block.timestamp is similar in behavior to L1, but two different blocks in L2 can have the same block.timestamp, unlike in L1`, but it doesn't explain why this is the case

For `hash`, it looks like the same function that is used as the Ethereum L1? I couldn't find any special definition, so I assume it is
undefined says There are many duplicate timestamps for blocks because Arbitrum One produces about 4 blocks a second. If each block needed a new timestamp it would get way out of sync with the real time because it's denominated in seconds and would need to increase 4 times a second.
Block hashes (as visible in the RPC) are the same format as eth L1, yes.
undefined says Is the ArbAddressTable precompile adopted by projects that build on top of arbitrum ?
undefined says I was reviewing Arbitrum network and wanted a clearification on one of the questions,
Do Arbitrum has something like Event hook, where it can fetch the details of the Event Emitted in Arbitrum(L2) on Ethereum(L1).?
Please do share any insights you might have.
Thanks in advance.!
undefined says Does it mean that if eth_blockNumber returned some block X eth_getLogs/eth_call can be called with this block X? 

In other words: do all RPC methods are finalized relatively to the last block of nitro node? (e.g. there is no way that eth_blockNumber returned block X and eth_getLogs/eth_call "doesn't know" anything about block X for some time).
undefined says Does anyone have an idea if it is required to implement IArbToken in order for bridging to ETH L1 to work? We have initially deployed our contract to Arbitrum as our main layer and it is non upgradeable + does not implement IArbToken of course... I'm trying to see if there is any way around wrapping it on Arbitrum to make it compatible.
undefined says I know there is the ReverseCustomGateway, but it still requires the token to implement IArbToken (I think, but I'm not totally sure)
undefined says how to query l1 base fee on-chain?
undefined says What's the standard way for exchanges to recognise an arbitrum transfer? Given there's only one sequencer to trust, would it not be possible for a malicious sequencer to tell the exchange that $10000000000 of ArbETH had been transferred? It would seem to confirm such a transfer (any transfer that we want to be sure is legit) we'd have to wait for L1 confirmation. Which as far as I'm aware is every 2-3 minutes or so? What does waiting for L1 look like in that case? Is it possible to see that a transaction posted to L2 is in a particular rollup on L1? How is that done? Would appreciate the help!
undefined says You can call eth_getBlockByNumber with tag finalized, it will give you a l2 block number which will never rollback (inlcuded in l1, and that l1 block is also finalized). And sequencer only have the power to order tx, it won't make any promise to the state, so you don't need to worry sequencer will transfer others token, because it can't make malicious tx as tx need private key's signature. The worst condition is sequencer orders your tx and give you feedback but not include it to l1, but just use the method I told you can avoid this condition.
undefined says You mean l2 base fee? https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L44
undefined says We will have reverse gatewat but for now it can't be used for now.
undefined says i'm doing a simple keeper service and i need to calculate l2 execution fee + l1 poster fee
undefined says You can just use the precompile method I sent you to calculate, it has all information you need.
undefined says ~~so i can just use `getCurrentTxL1GasFees()`?~~ nvm i can just calc it
undefined says Thanks, that helps. While I can understand this might be true of the running code of the sequencer, given there's just one sequencer, a malicious actor could just intercept requests at the RPC level, say for the eth_getBlockByNumber query, and then say that a block has been finalised when it hasn't right? and given there's only one sequencer, we would actually have to query l1 to trust it, since the sequencer could just say any value for eth_getBlockByNumber right?
undefined says You mean query l2 contract's event on l1? Or query arbitrum infor (e.g. bridge, inbox event), if is the second, you can subscribe our contract: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/tree/main/src/bridge
undefined says No, your node will serve the rpc request, sequencer only serve like those eth_sendRawTransaction that send a tx.
undefined says Ah I see, and just to be clear I understand, this is because the nodes are validating the state the sequencer produces?
undefined says Hmmm, so what would be the best way going forward in that case? I'm a bit confused, because the following post is mentioning ARB token uses it already... So we could create a custom one for ours, right (which in that case would be available trhough the official bridge UI as it just queries the router for the custom gateway we created and uses that one for bridging)?  
https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1121111483573612555
undefined says I want to query L2 contract's event on L1.
undefined says Sequencer will feed you the ordered tx, your node will execute it and get the state, sequencer won't feed the state
undefined says Only arb token can use it, we haven't open it public registered yet. But for custom ones, your token need implement IArbToken.
undefined says Oh, if so, it is not possible
undefined says To me this seems like it depends on the custom implementation of the gateway right... if I don't use the IArbToken interface in there, it isnt needed I think.... To make it clear, I won't use mint/burn but rather use a lock/unlock mechanism like used on L1 normally (Similar as the ARB L2 gateway uses, but without using IArbToken which requires the need for mint/burn which I can't implement in my existing L2 token).

Other than that. Is there a technical reason why only the ARB token is registered now in the router, and no other custom gateways can be registered? My purpose is to use it through the official bridge UI
undefined says So you mean you use your gateway and register to our gateway router? Technically yes it works, but you should be careful about your logic because if it has bugs, you might lose your tokem. For our reverse bridge, we are still under test to let eveyone can register it.
undefined says yes, indeed. thats our intended behavior. We will do extensive testing and will perform audits on it. But its good to know that it should work at least technically. 

For the public version of the reverse bridge, what is the approximate ETA?
undefined says In any case we're also planning to make all our gateways upgradeable so we can always intervene in the off chance of such problems
undefined says We are not sure about the timing yet, cause it needs audit after development as well.
undefined says Hey guys! I previously ran into this error when following the arbitrum-tutorials for token-deposit:
`ArbSdkError: Latest block did not contain base fee, ensure provider is connected to a network that supports EIP 1559.` coming from the `erc20bridger.deposit` function
I am currently using
`L1RPC="https:// goerli.infura.io/v3/<api key>"`
`L2RPC="https:// goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc"`
I have identified that `L1RPC` is the one causing the issue. I have tried the following:
1. refreshing my network
2. used a different RPC `https:// eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/`
to no avail.

Any help or advice on this is much appreciated!
undefined says Hey! I am a student trying to use Arbitrum Nova for a hackathon project. I can't seem to find a testnet for Arbitrum Nova. Am I missing something or do I just pay for the transactions? I have Arbitrum One goerli testnet eth already.
undefined says How long have you been experiencing that ?
undefined says Hey,
We don’t have a separate testnet for Arbitrum Nova! You can try Arbitum Goerli testnet. Both Nova and Arb Goerli are using the same stack. The only difference is how these two chains support Data availability so as a  dapp dev, you don’t need to worry about it. What’s the purpose of you project?
undefined says May I ask if arbitrum has its own unique JSON rpc command for obtaining block height?
undefined says It's still eth_blockNumber
undefined says I mean being able to obtain both the current block height and the latest block height rpc simultaneously
undefined says When I call the `ArbAddressTable` I'm getting a revert:

```
  [9079256848778899316] ArbAddressTableTest::testLookupIndex()

    │   └─ ← "EvmError: InvalidFEOpcode"
    └─ ← "EvmError: Revert"
```

Am I doing something wrong here>
undefined says You mean your node's block number and network's block number? We don't have that rpc, but you can use  eth_blockNumber to call both your node and 3rd party rpc provider to get this
undefined says Do you test this on local forked arbitrum network? Currently local forked still don't support precompile
undefined says Ah, yeah testing it locally on fork mode... what's the best way to test it ?
I guess having the chance onyl to test it when shipping is not ideal, right?
undefined says You can use our goerli testnet to test
undefined says ah so no way to make it work locally/CI... :\
undefined says Is it possible to get it somehow verified on etherscan https://arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000066#code ?
undefined says It doesn't contain real bytecode as it is precompile, but we have abi on it so you can call it on arbiscan directly
undefined says Can we fetch the Whitelisted validators mentioned in the Assertion Tree protocol or the whitelisted state root submitters of Arbitrum from Ethereum smart contract.?
undefined says I bridged my token from L1 to L2 using the standard gateway, I was unable to bridge the contract functions (mint, burn etc.). Is this supposed to be intended from using the standard gateway?
undefined says how did you fix it?
undefined says @Ricardo__Gordon | Arbitrum
undefined says You mean this? https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#allowlisted-validators
undefined says Yes, but where does the smart contract get this list from.?
Are there any functions where the validators check the validity etc. in the nitro contracts.?
undefined says @Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says The rollup admin sets the list of approved validators using the `setValidator()` function (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/2ba206505edd15ad1e177392c454e89479959ca5/src/rollup/RollupAdminLogic.sol#L166). This function appends the address to the `isValidator` mapping, a publicly accessible variable stored within the the rollup core contract. This mapping can be accessed by anyone interested in querying it: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35#readProxyContract#F17
undefined says When an ERC20 token is bridged for the first time, our standard gateway will deploy the L2 token contract which is an instance of `StandardArbERC20`(https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/StandardArbERC20.sol) which includes `bridgeMint`and `bridgeBurn` methods.

We provide a complete guide for how to do that in our docs which you can follow and make sure you are following the right process:
https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-standard
undefined says Thanks for this. I have 2 additional questions:
1. do wallet roles on L1 carry over to L2 (using standard gateway)? i.e. admin wallets, blacklisted/whitelisted wallets etc.
2. who is the owner of the contract for the standard gateway? my L1 token contract is configured to be a multisig contract (using gnosis safe), just wondering if this will be carried over to L2.
undefined says From what you're describing, I believe you need to use our generic-custom gateway. 
To give you some hints, there are some prerequisites your L1 token needs to meet (https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-generic-custom#step-0-review-the-prerequisites), if your L1 token (1) is already deployed, (2) does not meet these requirements, and (3) is not upgradeable, you need to wrap that and register the wrapped version of your token.

If you'd like to take one step back and learn token bridging better, here we describe a series of how-tos showcasing the different methods available for making your token bridgeable: https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-overview
undefined says im looking to integrate a contract with the arb bridge, the question that I have is does our L1 contract need to pay for the L2 transaction (with `msg.value`)? I see that the Inbox contract has some methods that do not require payment but I can't seem to find any documentation on them `sendContractTransaction`, `sendUnsignedTransaction`.
undefined says (I either need to bridge an ERC20 or do an cross-chain call, both would work for our use-case, we just can't pay using `msg.value`)
undefined says This need you have ethers on l2, you will pay the gas using l2 balance
undefined says We still recommand to use retryable ways as it would be safer.
undefined says That was a great help, Thank you so much. Can you share some guide or can someone help me understand the deployment and interactions of the nitro contracts, to better understand the flow. Actually we are trying to query the L2 event details on L1 so If we have a clear understanding of nitro contracts we can be well aware of our options. Please do let me know if any resources are available or any individual can guide us.
Thanks in advance🙂
undefined says what is the difference between mint and bridgeMint/burn and bridgeBurn?

from the overview under custom gateway, it says that `(for example, your token has the capacity to increase its supply on L2, and you want those L2-minted tokens to be withdrawable back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract)` does this mean i have to use custom gateway if i want to be able to mint directly on L2 (is this different from bridgeMint)?
undefined says You can verify l2 state on l1 by doing this: https://github.com/ensdomains/arb-resolver#how-l2-state-verification-on-l1-works, however, it is impossible to verify a l2 contract's emited event by this, you need use some tools like oracle to achieve
undefined says bridgemint is called by the gateway, mint is mostly called by owner address if your token contract has that function implement, but it still depends on you implemented it.
undefined says Thank you for the response.👍
undefined says am i right to say that bridgeMint increases the supply of the token on L1 which is then then bridged to L2?
undefined says No, bridgemint only called when your token locked on l1, so our gateway can call bridgemint to mint the related token on l2, it is a lock-mint brigde, it won't increase your token supply on l1.
undefined says are the bridgeMint-ed tokens withdrawable to L1 and recognized by L1 contract?
undefined says Yes, they will
undefined says Just a newbie question. Consider transferring assets from Aribtrum to another chain, say Aptos. Is it necessary to first transfer from Arbitrum to Ethereum and then to Ethereum to Aptos, or is it possible to bridge from Arbitrum to Aptos directly?
undefined says How?
undefined says I need assistance from a specialist in resolving a technical and financial issue. I have already communicated with one of your specialists, but he simply stopped responding to me and did not solve anything.
undefined says Hello, I asked for some details which we can use to check for the transaction you were talking about but you didn't provide them. So please do so. Thanks
undefined says Certainly, when moving assets from Arbitrum to different chains, the route must go through the primary Ethereum layer (L1). However, it's important to be aware that transferring from Arbitrum to Ethereum L1 will require a confirmation time of 7 days due to the utilization of live fraud proofs in our system. There's a possibility that certain third-party bridges offer a more direct option for transfers between Arbitrum and other chains, but these alternatives might involve additional fees.
undefined says Any example of such third party bridges that bypass transferring assets to Ethereum?
undefined says We provide a list on our protal:
https://portal.arbitrum.io/?search=bridge&categories=bridge
undefined says and these bypass transferring assets to Ethereum?
undefined says Another newbie question. What happens when a fraud happens? Does the L2 chain quashes the fraud blocks and rebuilds new block from the point of contention?
undefined says Nope - a fraud proof never causes a reorg. Fraud proofs dispute the chain's output (i.e., the state root to be confirmed in the L1 bridge). They don't affect the *inputs*, which are posted on L1 and deterministic. E.g., see https://docs.arbitrum.io/faqs/protocol-faqs#q-dispute-reorg
undefined says Suppose users A and B have balances 100 and 100 respectively on Arbitrum. There is a tx transferring 50 from A to B. Ideally the post state of such tx should be A=50 and B=150. But the sequencer maliciously makes the state A=100 and B=150. By the time a fraud proof is raised, A submits another tx (tx2) to transfer 100 to C. Then when a fraud proof is eventually raised, tx2 should also be nullified. Isn't it? Hence I thought a reorg would be necessary
undefined says As @dzack23 | Offchain Labs said, fraud proofs actually reject invalid state (outputs) and not the chain’s inputs. In your example, A’s second tx would be an invalid tx which will still be sequenced but it won't change the state, because invalid txs are skipped and have no effects. Note that there is a difference between the sequencer and validators. The sequencer can order transactions, but validators prove their effects. Even if the sequencer sequences invalid txs, nodes and validators will determine they have no effect and ignore them.
undefined says Where exactly does the arbitrum proposer saves the new state root? I can't find it in the core contracts... trying to compare the solutions with other rollups.

1. users send txs to sequencer
2. sequencer submits batches to l1
3. proposer creates a new state root from the batches and submits the new state root to l1

where is the state root exactly? Which contract? I've looked up in all the core contracts and can't find it.
undefined says Validators submit their assertions including the block hash to the rollup contract
undefined says How are invalid txs determined? I suppose all validators will be simultaneously executing L2 blocks and they find that the second tx is invalid because it is trying to send an amount more than its balance. Right?
undefined says Invalid tx will be ignored or reverted just as what ethereum does.
undefined says Why I can’t see them interacting with the contract on etherscan? This is the rollup contract https://etherscan.io/address/0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35 how do the submit the assertions if it cannot be seen on etherscan?
undefined says You need to see internal tx and click advanced mode
undefined says Thank you, so arbitrum proposers or validators (what is the right term?) use their own contracts to submit the value to the rollup contract, therefore it’s only shown as an internal tx.
undefined says You can see this contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7cf3d537733f6ba4183a833c9b021265716ce9d0
undefined says When you decode the input data, you can see the destination is     0x5eF0D09d1E6204141B4d37530808eD19f60FBa35
undefined says when can this passed AIP-2 get executed? https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/71941171835710778457735937894689629320431683601089057868136768380925169329077
undefined says it seems Arbitrum mainnet still do not support `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` options now, and act just like `eth_sendRawTransaction` that confirm the tx immediately
undefined says Question about developing/testing on the testnet - it seems like there's only 1 testnet for both `One` and `Nova` - is this the case?
undefined says just to add here: the sorts of transactions that are inherently "invalid" (and thus get ignored) are things like invalid signatures or txs with malformed data. @raghavendra your example of a double spend isn't "invalid", it would just revert. Reversion is behavior that's defined within the state transition like anything else; it's up to the _validators_ (not the user who created the tx, not the Sequencer) to ensure the STF rules are properly applied.
undefined says Hello! I was comparing between arbitrum and optimism and was wondering why doesn't arbitrum use the same pricing model as optimism for L1 data fees? 

I had a look on Dune and found that there were days where the L1 data fees charged on Arbitrum were less than the actual costs incurred from posting state. Whereas for Optimism, their protocol hasn't had any days where they've been unprofitable as a protocol. 

Is this an intentional trade-off to make fees cheaper on Arbitrum relative to Optimism? Would love to hear! Thank you
undefined says correct, both One and Nova operate on the same tech stack, so we use the same testnet for them; so Arb Goerli is our primary testnet, but we are working to add Arb Sepolia support soon as a backup (since Goerli has gotten congested at times)
undefined says we do not do an auction model, we do first come, first serve transaction ordering. So we have to set a base fee since we have to charge something, and from our experience it's better that a consistent fee is charged. Another thing to watch out for on Optimism is that due to their auction model, is that MEV is more easily exploitable with that model, and that costs you on trades
undefined says same problem, could anybody answer this?
undefined says wanted to add, for the L1 component itself, there is an optimization algorithm invoked that attempts to achieve the lowest average L1 cost. It's not a perfect algo, and sometimes it may be forced to pay higher than the batch posting costs, but we find that on average it works well. More detail explained here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#l1-calldata-fees
undefined says can you provide some context on the parameters you're using to construct the tx and also, could you let me know what endpoint you're using?
undefined says Also what is your node version?
undefined says is Arbitrum actively working on an interop solution for Orbit chains/L3s? the docs aren't very clear on this: https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction#can-my-orbit-chain-talk-to-other-orbit-chains
undefined says Yes, now you can deploy orbit on testnet by https://orbit.arbitrum.io/deployment/step/1
undefined says i'm trying to use `{"timestampMin": hex(future_timestamp)}` as option, and directly send to `https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/rpc` ; but the sequencer directly accept the tx, ignoring the timestamp requirement
undefined says to reproduce, you can sign a tx to yourself (0 value and empty calldata), then POST to `https://arb1-sequencer.arbitrum.io/rpc` JSON `{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"eth_sendRawTransactionConditional", "params": [signed_tx_hex, {"timestampMin": "0x64f5a041"}]}`  (this value is 10 days after now); I expect this eth_sendRawTransactionConditional being rejected by sequencer. but it acutally immediately accepted and published on-chain
undefined says Got it @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs thank you. And then the implications of your formula vs optimism's is that there are cheaper fees per transaction on Optimism? (was playing with some numbers I found and seems to be true) 

The other implication is mev is harder to exploit via Arbitrum model compared to Optimism?
undefined says And then when we refer to MEV, with the FCFS model, the protocol itself removes the problem of toxic MEV so things like front-running and sandwich attacks (the latter harder is much harder to implement). 

Arbitrage still happens but is more based on speed on posting transaction so the MEV game itself shifts to those who have fastest speeds (or are closest to Arbitrum nodes), would this understanding be correct?
undefined says And just curious, what's the top problems on Off-chain labs mind for Arbitrum? @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs  could you reproduce this? or having a docs demostrating how to force a tx only confirmed after a timestamp?
undefined says hey mookim, we are looking into this; we only recently added `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` support, so it looks like we will need to correct this behavior; will follow up
undefined says yeah I would generally make that argument about MEV on the two approaches. It's fundamental to auction mechanic vs FCFS mechanic. And correct, in FCFS approach, speed would be primary factor.
undefined says I wouldn't state anything in particular as "problems". We're proud of what we've built so far and are aggressively working to expand what Arbitrum can do. Our current efforts are for streamlining L3 Orbit chains and making them super user friendly to deploy as well as our upcoming Stylus launch to support multiple programming languages (initially Rust, C, C++) besides just Solidity and enable cheaper compute via optimized wasm contracts. We're also working to get permissionless validation enabled so we can remove the validator whitelist
undefined says Amazing, completely got it, thank you. Agree "problems" is the wrong framing (a fan of Arbitrum myself)
undefined says And how much is gas from posting on the L1 something you're looking to solve / find a solution to?
undefined says You can find currently the gas cost on arbiscan tx page's advance info like: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x6bad50f1426b54514991277073b323e503157c39357d7e164cc8b3e0a1b9dc86#txninfo , you can also see each batch's cost here: https://arbiscan.io/batches, and in the near future, when eip4844 deployed, we will also support it, which will reduce the l1 cost significantly: https://www.eip4844.com/
undefined says I want to know if there is any api to fetch the supported RPC method calls filtered through chains?
undefined says How long does it take to challenge if there is "dispute" and fraud proof happens? The confirmation of the state change is more delayed than normal(no challenge)? Does it affect Arbitrum network during the challenge?
undefined says I don't think we have rpc method like that, but we support evm rpc method and also geth type trace rpc (debug) : https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/ and https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug#debugtracecall
undefined says Usually it can be solved within the fraud proof window because we have timeout for each round, but it also might have delay attack, but we have bold to prevent that, you can see what is delay attck and bold (bold is not alive yet): https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf
undefined says So, it can be "delay attack" by some validators, but it does not happen now because there are only "good" validators running by OffchainLabs, right?
undefined says They are not only running by offchain labs, but also other parties here are the address list: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#allowlisted-validators, and delay attach can't change the chain's state, they can just delay the rblock confirmation
undefined says Tell me how can I get ETH for Arbitrum Sepolia?
undefined says Here’s the faucet:

https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
undefined says Got it @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs , once EIP-4844 is deployed, would L1 gas variability be something on Arbitrum's mind? I had a read over the docs and I guess it depends on where the prices rebase too depending on demand for blob space vs the lower bound of calldata
undefined says does arbitrum runs own blockchain to update the states besides running the sequencers?
undefined says Hey team could someone pass along a note to the Arbiscan team? 

We've been trying to get data to show up on Arbitrum on Arbiscan named NFTEarthOFT and symbol is NFTE.

It shows up fine on Etherscan and BaseScan but is not fetching the data on Arbiscan for some reason.
undefined says Arbitrum itself is a separate chain that runs on top of the Ethereum and derives its security from that. Sequencer recieves the incoming txs and orders them, and then validators run those txs through the State Transition Function in order and emit new L2 blocks. 
See this for more information of how Arbitrum chain operates:
https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#sequencing-followed-by-deterministic-execution
undefined says Hey, I'll flag this to their team
undefined says hey guys , is their an address for the native token on Arbitrium ? @Mahsa | Offchain Labs @Ricardo__Gordon | Arbitrum
undefined says Do you mean arb token?
undefined says ARB - is the Arbitrum governance token
USDC.e -  is USDC bridged from other networks.
USDC - is USDC native on the Arbitrum network issued by Circle.

ARB contract: <https://arbiscan.io/address/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548>
USDC contract: <https://arbiscan.io/token/0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831>
USDC.e contract: <https://arbiscan.io/token/0xff970a61a04b1ca14834a43f5de4533ebddb5cc8>
undefined says uhmm have you tried https://app.union.finance/ , I was wondering which tokens can I borrow on the Arb chain from it in place of Dai , like can I borrow ETH , any hints for this ?
undefined says Please reach out to union finance. They'll be able to help you better. You can use the #🌐︱defi-chat for questions like this too
undefined says my company is considering switching from ETH mainnet to Arbitrum L2, may I know which doc is recommended to follow in order to make changes in our current code right? Than you
undefined says Arbitrum is EVM compatible. So deploying on Arb is no different than on Ethereum mainnet, same code could be used. You could see this: https://docs.arbitrum.io/solidity-support where we list subtle differences
undefined says so there will be extra code change apart from specifying ```  
        "geth": {
        "httpUri": "",
        "wsUri": "",
        "networkId": ,} ```, right?
undefined says well you can take a look at our sample codes to make sure you have the config right:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says Hey everyone! I'm working on the "Escrin Smart Contract Helper", aiming to supercharge DApps by securely connecting on-chain contracts with private off-chain data. Would love some feedback to tailor it better for fellow devs like you (more information at escrin.org/).  Cheers! 🙏🛠️

🚀 Key Features:
• Confidential off-chain computing
• Integration with major blockchains & languages (Solidity, Rust)
• Uses TEEs like Intel SGX for secure enclave execution
undefined says Hey all, I am looking for an explorer where I can use a query string to get the latest block height on `sepolia-arbitrum` 
Similar to this:
https://api-goerli.arbiscan.io/api?module=proxy&action=eth_blockNumber
but with sepolia, any help greatly appreciated
undefined says Could you just query from the rpc interface instead ex. `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","id":"latest"}' https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc`
undefined says Or you can also use the api that blockscout provides: https://sepolia-explorer.arbitrum.io/api-docs#block, `?module=block&action=eth_block_number`
undefined says hey @logicbeach.eth :froge:  :waq: I've also found the Foundry `cast` CLI tool to be useful for this: `cast block-number --rpc-url [RPC_URL_HERE]` documented here: https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-block-number
undefined says I'm wondering if there are multisig services like Safe already deployed on Arbitrum Nova. I'm Carl from EthTrader on Reddit. We're investigating porting our Donut activity to Nova.
undefined says Contracts are deployed but their official ui doesn’t support Nova, but you can host your own
undefined says Am I doing this correctly by using: https://sepolia-explorer.arbitrum.io/api?module=block&action=eth_block_number
undefined says Oh, seems our blockscout forbid this module, you might need try other ways as harry and chrisco mentioned.
undefined says Understood. I am monitoring block height on a few chains using test queries like that, so I may need to change my logic for arb-sepolia.. Thanks!
undefined says I've got a question I want to post in here, but the server keeps blocking it, saying that the message contains content that is blocked by the server. I don't know what it would be, though. It's a question about estimating gas
undefined says I guess the long and short of it is: can gas be estimated using only ethersjs? Or is a specific library for arbitrum required?
undefined says Yeah you can just use ethers and use eth_estimateGas against Arb RPCs to have the estimated gas. Arb nodes will compute all necessary gas and report it
undefined says Does L1 archive node is mandatory to run a Arbitrum archive node?
undefined says No, just fullnode is ok
undefined says Ok, does this mean that I can just treat the whole process the same way as we do for ethereum? Fetch prices via an api, get gas quantity estimate from `contract.estimateGas`, and then pass the same gas override keys when calling contract functions?
undefined says We provide a detailed guide (together w the code) that shows exactly how you could estimate gas on Arb: https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says My question isn't "how to estimate gas", it's "can rely on `contract.estimateGas` to do gas estimation in the same way that we do on ethereum, using ethersjs"

However, discord kept blocking me from posting it for some reason
undefined says yea that link contains a handful of good info about how gas works on Arb and how estimation takes place.
Short answer is, you can use ethers and  eth_estimateGas to estimate gas **but** against Arbitrum nodes. The reason is gas on Arbitrum is two dimensional (see this: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9).
undefined says ok, I will have a look. Thank you!
undefined says Getting a lot of `Unindexed transactions` from Nitro node's logs, is this normal?
undefined says It is not errors, no need to worry
undefined says Thought so, thanks
undefined says I have been looking into EIP-4844 (or Proto-Danksharding) recently, and I see there are plans to use Blob TX to roll up Arbitrum L2 TX to L1 (https://research.arbitrum.io/t/eip-4844-shard-blobs-and-how-we-would-use-them). I’m just wondering if Arbitrum has any plans to support users directly posting Blob TX on L2.

Imagine a fully-on-chain NFT or GameFi project based on Arbitrum One or Nova, and they want to store the Dapp site and user assets as TX Blobs introduced by EIP-4844. So what happens if they directly post a Blob TX to Arbitrum L2? Will the Blob be simply ignored, rolled up to L1 somehow, or persisted somewhere? Thanks for your clarification.
undefined says No, we currentlt don't have this plan
undefined says Hey I am a rust dev and I want to migrate solidity code into stylus. Will this make the contracts consume less gas and give faster finalization?
undefined says I'd post over in #🖊︱stylus-devs for more responses, but in general using stylus should save a large amount of gas depending on what you're doing. I'm not sure what you mean by faster finalization there
undefined says If arbitrum is single sequencer, why doesn't the sequencer just sign the blocks to enable trust minimized bridging of non-native assets? This signature could be included in the L1 transaction for reference.
undefined says I'm not sure what you mean here. All the sequencer does is order transactions included in the system. It's not trusted with the result of executing those transactions at all. That's enforced by validators instead
undefined says I've got a quick question Re: the Arbitrum bug bounty. The Immunefi bug bounty page at https://immunefi.com/bounty/arbitrum/ doesn't specifically list the Nitro stack (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) as being in-scope for the bounty. I just wanted to clarify as to whether Nitro is indeed in scope or not. Thanks.
undefined says Yes, you can use immunefi even if it doesn't explicit the nitro stack.
undefined says Doesn't the sequencer forward information to the inbox? If the sequencer is saying what trxs are included and the order, then I think they can also be trusted to attest to the blocks themselves.

This would help level the playing field for bridging against something like Cosmos's trust minimized IBC where block headers are past as proof instead of relying on third parties.

Perhaps you're referring to the option to force self include as well, which is fine but in this case one would forgoe the attestation provided by the sequencer.

How is the information batched to the inbox? Is it done in blocks?
undefined says I guess you'd also need to pass a reference block in order to prove finality, so like 20 or so blocks out you get that signauture as well which references the block you want to prove for trust minimized finality. Could use a merkle root as well.
undefined says thanks very much for the info. i'll go ahead and submit bugs for the Nitro stack for consideration in the bounty via Immunefi then.
undefined says No, if sequencer are responsible for the results, there will be other security issues need to figure out and we need to much more things to prevent that, so for now, it only order the tx and will not send out the state result so it can't steal user's funds, if it can determine the state, then it can send out a wrong state that add funds to its address which doesn't belong to it. The l2 state on l1 is protected by fraud proof.
undefined says I have one question regarding the output root dispute.
Suppose I make one token transfer transaction on arbitrum after that my transaction will included in output root.
If anyone raises dispute within challenge period of 7 days against that output root and found malicious then my transaction(which is present inside the same root) will be reverted or not?
undefined says So who sends data to the sequencer inbox and is it done by block or trx? If it's backed by fraud proofs why does it matter who sends it?
undefined says nope, fraud proofs themselves never cause a transaction to revert or get discarded. Fraud proofs are a dispute over the result some inputs (transactions); they don't change the inputs themselves, which are ordered in the inbox and deterministic from that point onwards. All a dispute does is delay confirmation to the L1 bridge.
undefined says there's a few good reasons to maintain a separation of responsibilities between ordering and execution: for one, forcing the sequencer to commit to a state root would impose an addtiional overhead cost on the system (without any clear gain). Also validation (execution) can be permissionless, while fast sequencing fundmentally can't be. Note that once validation is permissionless (hopefully not too far way) this whole question becomes moot
undefined says 
undefined says How can configure nitro for Sepolia? I am using these parameters but get errors (invalid address):
`./nitro --l2.chain-id 421614  --l1.chain-id  11155111 --l1.url http://xx.xx.xx.xx:58545 --http.addr xx.xx.xx.xx  --http.port 22545  --persistent.chain /space/sepolia/nitro --node.forwarding-target null`

Unfortunately can't post the errors because your bot in the channel blocks my posts. Are there some docs on how to run `nitro` process for Sepolia?
undefined says Thank you for this, but this doesn't really help answer my question. I was assuming the sequencer pays to post the data to L1 thus creating a profit for the remaining amount, around 30% as I understand.

If the sequencer is pushing that data to the L1 I don't see why it can't also sign part of that data. It's not adding any additional trust assumptions, it's just attesting to what happened. Others may still force include trxs, they just forgo this additional benefit.
undefined says To help me understand, it would be great to have some kind of example. Does the sequencer post data block by block, does it do it in batches, anything along those lines would be helpful because howerver it gets batched would determine what the signature attestation would reflect.

I'm assuming the sequencer is whitelisted to be able to post this data in a non-force-inclusion way.
undefined says what nitro version do I need to run sepolia? I am noticing that v.2.0.14 (which I am currently using) is not including sepolia chaininfo. But v2.0.14 is the official stable version
undefined says 
undefined says hey guys i ran into this error when doing the tutorial for `custom-token-bridging`
undefined says can anyone help with this?
undefined says I compiled v2.1.0 beta 14 and tried to run with parameters for Sepolia but it gives me this error: 
 `error initializing database              err="unsupported L2 chain ID 421614"`
undefined says what did you pass to that call in the SDK?
undefined says can you share the TS or JS that you ran?
undefined says can you try passing `--node.feed.input.url=wss://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/feed` to it?
undefined says will try, but what is the equivalent of `--l1.url` for 2.1.0 nitro?
undefined says `--parent-chain.connection.url` ?
looks like it is fetching blocks. so now I suppose I got the genesis, I can terminate the process, and relaunch without `--node.feed.input.url` ???
undefined says great! I got it synced. So is 2.1.0 beta14 ready for running or should I wait for the official announcement before using it?
undefined says Are you sure you compiled v2.1.0 beta 14? Because this error log is an old-version log which doesn't exsit in v2.1.0, you might need to git checkout v2.1.0-beta.14 to compile again
undefined says I have pulled the master, then I did `git checkout 9a6559822372e7e65b36f3eb96f927bfa4e64f0d`, which is v2.1.0 beta 14, then `make build` , cd `cmd/nitro` ;`go build`
undefined says I have accidentally executed wront binary a few times, but now I am running 2.1.0 beta 14
undefined says Ok, that is the reason why you have that errors, v2.1.0 beta14 support sepolia rollups
undefined says Is there any new testnet now ?
Or still Goerli ?
undefined says We released sepolia l2 testnet and stylus testnet recently: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says here are the files
undefined says here is my hardhat config
```require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    compilers: [{ version: "0.8.19" }],
  },
  networks: {
    l1: {
      gas: 2100000,
      gasLimit: 0,
      url: process.env.L1RPC,
      accounts: [process.env.DEVNET_PRIVKEY],
    },
    l2: {
      url: process.env.L2RPC,
      accounts: [process.env.DEVNET_PRIVKEY],
    },
  },
};```
undefined says Hey @undefyned , I just tested the tutorial and it works ok. Does the unmodified version from the repo work for you?

Also, I see you modified some of the contracts, so I'm not sure if something was introduced there that might be causing issues. Verify if you require to do any extra steps in between the deploy and registration calls with the new contracts (any extra configuration or initialization that you might need).
undefined says they're posted in batches (which include many blocks). the sequencer/ (batch poster) has affordance to call this method: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/2ba206505edd15ad1e177392c454e89479959ca5/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L175
undefined says Hm ok. To me it seems like a decision to not pay the gas to support the feature. I don't understand the counter argument of separating execution and ordering.

If the blob submission trx fails, all the signatures batched would revert as well.

The sequencer would need to be slashed for providing an improper signature of the block but that seems pretty straightforward to handle and can be done optimistically as well.

The sequencer would include a reference block in each signature to prove finality. So the hash signed could be the merkle root of the reference block and current block.

So on one side if a trx is processed through the sequencer ordering a block, you get this additional ability to attest that the trx did indeed take place and can provide the signature proof to any OP chain for example. Seems like a pretty big feature add that steals the thunder of one of the core value adds of Cosmos.

If you can provide a specific attack vector, that would be helpful.
undefined says thanks a lot for help, you guys doing a great job with Arbitrum!
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says I'm still not clear on what it is you're suggesting: a) if we want the sequencer to commit to a state root, I'm not sure where "signatures" come in; you could just add a state root field in a batch, but b) I don't see the point of the sequencer doing this when we have a whole validator system already. If the sequencer can simply make attestations, these wouldn't be "trust minimized"; users of it would simply be trusting the sequencer; for them to be trustless, this reduces to just duplicating the whole validator system.
undefined says Optimistic attestation systems (that, e.g., can be disputed but have a shorter dispute window than the underling challenge mechanisms) could be useful, but it seems to me these can and should be handled at the application level, not protocol level (indeed several bridge projects are working on things like this). I see only downsides in coupling this at with the sequencer role. 

If we're still talking past each other, it may be helpful if you could write up your idea/questions more thoroughly
undefined says did you solve your issue ? just encountered the same error
undefined says when i transfer tokens between L1 and L2 the max total supply only increase but does not decrease? i.e. if i transfer 100 L1 tokens to L2 the max total supply of L2 increases by 100 but L1 remains the same. is this intended or is there anyway to get around this?
undefined says anyone would know why Im suddenly getting "error acting as staker                   err="error advancing stake" in my node ? No change changes on my side since months, just restarted my node today and it started complaning out of nowhere...
undefined says Sorry for the simple question but I am struggling to find a Arb One WebSocket RPC connection provider, only http endpoints - do they exist?
undefined says Gotcha. I think we're speaking the same language.

Basically I'm saying to sign the batch and provide a reference to a previous signed batch as well that's say 20 blocks out for finality purposes. 

That way someone could take the future batch and validate a trx in the batch you want to prove in.

The signature coming from the sequencer provides 2 things, 1 is that it's a semi trusted actor and 2 it already has the ability to have fraud proofs submitted against it.

You could open this up to anyone I suppose that's willing to lock up a bunch of ETH on the L1 and just provide signatures that could be contested, but then you'd have to pay that additional actor.

If the sequencer is yeilding 30%+ right now, I think there's a lot of room to pay for this additional calldata and you get trust minimized bridging that no other bridge operator can rival.

Take stargate for example. Someone oracle passes a block header that may or may not have occured, no one knows, we just trust the oracle. Then the relayer provides the data necessary for the patricia proof. We trust that these actors don't collude or censor.

With the approach I've suggested you get the same security guarantees as the optimistic process itself. And with the signature you can do the patricia proof on another protocol and cutout the need for trusted actors since the sequencer already has a financial interest in not submitting fraudulent information.
undefined says You could make the batch signing better with some kind of merkle root as well which is how other protocols do it.
undefined says Do you support debug api such as `debug_traceBlockByNumber`?
undefined says yes this is indended for l1 native tokens using the standard token gateway; depositing escrows tokens on L1 and mints token on L2, so L2 supply changes but L1 supply does not https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/token-bridge/token-bridge-erc20#default-standard-bridging
undefined says i am currently using generic-custom gateway. must i use the custom gateway to fix this?
undefined says is this my ISP problem or something on sepolia side? are there other RPCs? using chainlist.org here
undefined says what do you mean "fix this"? i.e., what's your goal exactly?
undefined says Might be a Chainlist issue. You can also see the RPC information in our documentation => https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/node-providers
undefined says when depositing from L1 to L2, i intend for my L1 tokens to be burned on L1 (instead of escrowed) and minted on L2. and vice versa for withdrawal from L2 to L1. i also intend to mint directly on L2 and make it withdrawable to L1.
undefined says this is similar to what is in the token bridging overview ``for example, your token has the capacity to increase its supply on L2, and you want those L2-minted tokens to be withdrawable back to L1 and recognized by the L1 contract``. in the custom gateway tutorial, the gateway examples are of the arbitrum generic-custom gateway. if i were to adapt it for my goal above, do i just call the ``mint`` and ``burn`` functions instead of ``escrow`` (for L1Gateway.outboundTransfer) and ``bridgeBurn`` (for L2Gateway.outboundTransfer)?
undefined says Is your L1 token contract already deployed and live?
undefined says just curious why you want this type of model? without a single source of truth it can be difficult to manage, especially since L1 to L2 messages and vice versa are asynchronous. So your supply would be ambiguous, since L2 to L1 messages take at least 1 week to confirm on L1, and any withdrawals would have burned on L2 but not yet minted on L1
undefined says greetings! we're diving into the arbitrum ecosystem and i'm looking for advise or someone to please point me in the right direction with regards to gasless relay options for us. looking at OZ Defender but i have some uncertainty as to the [trusted] Forwarder we would need to implement - the OZ MinimalForwarder is flagged as test/dev only.
are there any other vendors, services of robust forwarders that supports Nova?
undefined says basically i would like to be able to mint on L2 and i want the L2-minted tokens to be withdrawable back to L1. how else should i implement the custom gateway to achieve this?
undefined says We have reverse gateway, but we are in the process to make it can be used, it will be public soon
undefined says do you have any soft ETA on this?
undefined says We don't for now, but it already under process
undefined says Hey, I'd like to know what `arbitrum_ethereum_block_height` is in metrics!
undefined says alright, but can i get more details on how the reverse gateway work?
undefined says Sure, we have codebase here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ReverseCustomGateway.sol and https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ReverseCustomGateway.sol, but we are still under test, so for now it has deployed a public permissionless version
undefined says is there a L1ReverseCustomGateway for this?
undefined says also taken from the documentation: `The reverse custom gateway burns on the l2 and escrows on the l1 is the opposite of the way the normal custom gateway works means that the total supply L2 isn't affected by briding, which helpful for obeservers calculating the total supply especially if minting is also occuring on L2` does this mean that minting and burning can still occur on L1?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1ReverseCustomGateway.sol
undefined says You can see the l1 reverse logic, it will burn when user deposit token back to l2
undefined says correct me if im wrong but based on the logic it seems that in this case i MUST mint on L2. if i mint only on L1 and i deposit to L2 there will be no tokens to escrow and it will fail
undefined says either L1 or L2 should be your source of truth for your supply; there are rare exceptions where this is not the best model, and it introduces a lot of risk and complexity to go with a model that allows for arbitrary supply increases/decreases on both chains. 

if L2 is your source of truth, then the L1 contract will have a mint/burn function, but only the L1 gateway should have authority to invoke those functions (based on L2 deposits/withdrawals)
undefined says i see thank you for this
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs 
Is there any way to update bridged erc-20 token's Token Info on Arbiscan?

- I am the owner of L1 token.
- I bridged with Official arbitrum bridge (https://bridge.arbitrum.io)
- The L2 token owner became the arbitrum's bridge address (https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb4b8b6f88361f48403514059f1f16c8e78d61ffd)

So, I can't verify ownership of L2 token contract and change token info on Arbiscan.
undefined says what info are you looking to change?
undefined says I want to change token info on arbiscan. such as, token image, website link etc
undefined says I think this is doable if you can validate ownership of the equivalent L1 token; but you'll have to contact Etherscan support for this
undefined says did you already update the L1 token info?
undefined says actually i already validated on L1 chain. But on L2(arbitrum) chain, bridge address has the ownership of my L2 token contract so there are no way that i can validate myself.
undefined says ok, contact Etherscan and let them know to update the L2 to identical info as the L1; they know how to reverse lookup the L1 contract from an L2 bridged token: https://etherscan.io/contactus
undefined says thx for your support!
undefined says Or what about sharing a sequencer inbox? I think zkevm can do shared provers which to me sounds like proving from multiple chains to the same inbox.

I think this should be the top priority for you guys right now. If the dydx launch goes well, there could be a huge exodus of TVL towards cosmos as confidence rebuilds.
undefined says Any idea why this would be happening on Arbitrum Sepolia?
https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc RPC url fails to query more than 40 items however when I tried connecting via QuickNode RPC it worked just fine...
undefined says It might be your contract revert it or it hits the request limit, but since you said use quicknode endpoint works so you may hit our public rpc limit, if you need send lots of rpc request, you should use 3rd party provider for this.
undefined says Does ARB have the equivalent of "bedrock" upgrade coming anytime soon?
undefined says We already have nitro upgrade last year, this year we will have stylus upgrade which will support EVM+ (You can write contract using rust, c, c++)
undefined says Is there a contract on arb similar to the `CrossDomainOwnable3` on Optimism? https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossDomainOwnable3.sol
undefined says Also what is the best way to get the cross chain tx caller in arbitrum? I see in the greeter tutorial it just check against msg.sender https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/greeter/contracts/arbitrum/GreeterL2.sol#L35 is msg.sender in arbitrum == the actual tx sender on mainnet ?
undefined says If your tx send on l1 and your sender is contract, your msg.sender on l2 will be alias address, so you can see why our tutorial does that, you can check if the caller address aliased or not by calling: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/precompiles/ArbSys.sol#L65
undefined says For more details, you can check here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging
undefined says I don't think we have this provide, but you can implement it manually.
undefined says So on L2 only contracts addresses are aliased? if my sender is an EOA on l1, the address on l2 will be the same?
undefined says All unsigned msg will alisaed (sorry for confused), but you can make eoa doesn't alisa by sending signed message: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg/scripts/normalTx.js#L82
undefined says Thats literally single request though 🤔 Is there like response length limit?
undefined says Hola
I am a solidity engineer from ExxNetwork
Hope you are doing well
We wish to implement the open source token bridge of OffChain Labs (used on Arbitrum), on Shibarium One chain.
I am currently running into issues compiling the contracts, something about version conflicts.
Please, let me know if you are open to help and if there are ways to go about this.
Thanks
undefined says Yes, the node has response length limit, what the size of your response?
undefined says You can directly change the code to make it can be compiled of your version, any issues when you change the code?
undefined says I haven't tried that yet
undefined says Response length: 608851, tried many testnets none of them failed to fetch such request with public RPC, this is the first one that didnt go through 🤷‍♂️
undefined says For this type request, use 3rd party rpc would be better, because as I know 3rd party rpc should limit to 10MB by default.
undefined says for this type request i guess i'd rather switch back to another chain. Forcing users to add our 3rd party rpc just so they can open the dapp doesnt seem like a good solution 🙂 thought Arb supposed to be scalable, seems like not so much 🙂
undefined says We implement this to avoid dos attack, not to limit the user experience, for dev needs, 3rd party rpc can provide faster and large response, and user can choose any type rpc service they want, hope you can understand, thanks
undefined says Can you share what rpc request you're running that's failing to we can verifiy if it's an expected limit or not
undefined says Currently not home but its a simple contract read operation so I believe should be "eth_call"
undefined says If we can recreate it locally we can better figure out why it's failing. We haven't hit any other complaints about issues with the RPC like this so I'd like to figure out better what the limitation is
undefined says 
undefined says Basically what that request contains is an array of structs, once base64 encoded svg gets added to the image field it fails at 40 items. If no base64 images added then it goes through.
Struct contents:
undefined says Is there a way to get prices from Arbitrum programmatically, like an official API enpoint?
Get quote for certain tokens and amounts to be precise.
undefined says I guess I was specifically referring to gas fees... Bedrock makes optimism much cheaper than arbitrum, so wanted to see if arbitrum has anythign similar in store
undefined says please use arbitrum scan apis
undefined says thanks
undefined says If you look at l2fees.info which tracks fees of different L2s, Arbitrum One looks cheaper than Optimism https://l2fees.info/. We're always working on further improvements to cost and efficiency, but nothing particular announced currently other than Stylus which Jason mentioned and will be a huge improvement
undefined says It doesn't. Recheck that. OP is 3 cents to send ETH vs 5 cents on ARB and more importantly its 2.5x more expensive to swap ETH on ARB than OP
undefined says I have seen ArbOS currenctly is version 6. Right?? So, Where can I find the history for previous versions / release updates info?
undefined says ylus
undefined says This might be some network influences, for example, for now, eth transfer on arb is 3 cents and optimism is 5 cents: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x65a66335f56ebfe5f9a89c0d3878ad1841544d3beac8bb737256967b5b659fd8 and https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x771b87f35895a8a5bf5b0171a3ea1e1fabf69d7b9f5dfef2dd143db06369ff0e
undefined says Where do you see your arbos consensus, you can check your current version by calling `arbsys.ArbOSVersion1` https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/precompiles/ArbSys.sol#L35. If returns 65, it's correct (you need to add 55 to current version since nitro start at 55), also our latest stable version of nitro node is offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.14-2baa834, you can upgrade your node if needed. Our consensus info is in github nitro release page: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/releases/tag/consensus-v10
undefined says Oh, then Currently version is 65-55 = 10 ??
undefined says Why blank is 7 btw 9?? lol
undefined says Has this json file been updated yet?   `"InitialArbOSVersion": 6,` 
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/38ad1f1ea750b4658b6aca8909c12375e2f2bb36/cmd/chaininfo/arbitrum_chain_info.json#L36C13-L36C13
undefined says Also, the Arbitrum nova appears to be a nitro version of the same. Right?
https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000064#readContract
undefined says It's just initial, not the current, it can be upgraded
undefined says yes
undefined says Okay, i have a one more question. what does "makeFakeTxForMesseage" function? 
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/38ad1f1ea750b4658b6aca8909c12375e2f2bb36/arbos/l1pricing/l1pricing.go#L540
undefined says This is just used for tests and it has been removed in our new releases.
undefined says Oh no… So the source code I can see now is not in production, where can I see it?
undefined says You can checkout to v2.0.14 and see
undefined says I'm 100% more ARB is a lot more expesnive than OP, expecially for transactions with a lot of information on it.
For example a parlay bet on Overtime on OP is 10-20 cents, whereas on ARB is $1.50-$2.00
undefined says Arbitrum One is definitely more expensive sometimes. Arbitrum Nova is much cheaper. I'm not sure exactly what you're asking here though
undefined says specifically asking if there is the equilvent of "bedrock" upgrade that Optimism did a few months back
undefined says There are many different active R&D efforts involving improvements to Arbitrum technology, but nothing specifically like Bedrock at this time
undefined says Generally Arbitrum development has prioritized security much more than reducing cost so far, For example see the active work on BOLD https://medium.com/@offchain/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc
undefined says We're trying to directly integrate one of our smart contracts with the ETH>ARB bridge. From what I've read the bridge contract should be able to tell it's a SC passing the funds through and use tx.origin to send the funds to the EOA on ARB. However I'm not seeing this happen in my testing. 

Some insight would be good. TIA
undefined says Have you read through https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-standard ? If not I'd recommend going through that
undefined says Sorry I should have clarified, bridging ETH, not an ERC20.
undefined says depositEth on the inbox contract does not seem to accept an address parameter.
undefined says It looks as though it tries to set the destination address with AddressAliasHelper if the msg.sender != tx.origin, however it does not send the ETH on ARB goerli to the correct address, it sends it neither to the contract address nor the EOA account interacting with it. It just seems to be a random address.
undefined says Ah sorry didn't realize what you were going for.  Using the `depositEth` method your options are pretty limited and since it just deposits eth to your address on L2 for EOA's or the alias of your contract address that's the caller. The reason for this is that even though you control the contract address on L1, you might not on L2, whereas an L1 contract can make arbitrary calls on L2 through its alias address

For more advanced usecases you can use the `createRetryableTicket` ticket method which lets you create an arbitrary cross chain transaction carrying eth. I don't think we currently have an example of using it to deposit eth in our tutorials, but there are general docs about how it works at https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging and it's used to power the `depositTo` method in the sdk https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/29290590d5955d8bffa2d2bb80a64e98601077e8/src/lib/assetBridger/ethBridger.ts#L231
undefined says Is it possible to create tx from eth mainnet to arb chain via sendL1FundedContractTransaction calling the 0x4Dbd4fc535Ac27206064B68FfCf827b0A60BAB3f (delayed inbox)?
undefined says You can use `sendL1FundedContractTransaction` thought it's not very well documented. I'd recommend using retryable tickets for cross chain communication with the `createRetryableTicket` method https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/cross-chain-messsaging#ethereum-to-arbitrum-messaging
undefined says lets say that I have this contract it basically mint nft 0x47Ec4768502ADA411bce8b973a6609f3F96061f3 and I need to call function - purchase batch,will it be possible to send tx from eth mainnet and expect that it will be executed at arb network minter contract?
undefined says Yep using retryable tickets is the recommended way to execute cross chain transactions. You can find an example of using it at https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/greeter
undefined says @Harry | Offchain Labs Thanks, as far as I understood this requires some offchain gas calculation etc, can I use  createRetryableTicket directly from my contract and do I need to have balance for l2 gas fees, or there way how can I pay gas fees at l1?
undefined says this is the tx that I have created but for some reasons the address was incorrect at the l2 ,any ideas why? l2 tx - 0x6c1c9ed4a7f2e514838af778b7bfaa844560867b750ed9226efde18b800d99b5, l1- 0xbdcb23a57c1e628dc35c053ba94f6a6d80b8d56e7cd30b5034003194f24a8563 the to address is 0x05a131e657855263Da33856dF61Ac3f02A67190B but I've specified it as 0x47Ec4768502ADA411bce8b973a6609f3F96061f3
undefined says im trying to run the latest node version but im getting
`Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --l1.url`
undefined says i just run --help and there is indeed no --l1.url anymore
undefined says wdym reload it
undefined says oh i was looking at the beta repo my bad
undefined says Yep in the next version that will become `--parent-chain.url` btw if you want to run with the beta
undefined says `0x47ec4768502ada411bce8b973a6609f3f96061f3` is the to address of the transaction, not the sender. The from address on the transaction `0x05a131e657855263Da33856dF61Ac3f02A67190B` is what's called the alias of the sender address of the caller of  the call to `createRetryableTicket` on L1 which was `0xf49031e657855263Da33856dF61aC3F02A6707fa`. Aliasing is explained here https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing
undefined says I have a question because there is some confusion about the terminology being used in Abitrum. ArbAggregator, Sequencer, Batch Poster, fee collector... I'm sure the same names are being called differently. Can you introduce a page that defines these terms??
+ there is differences btw `arb blocknumber` and  `l2 blocknumber`?
undefined says I'm not sure why the TxSize is fixed at 140 here, can you explain?
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/89d4a99e6990505272a0208b0ccbda730dc228ba/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.go#L23
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says How exactly are transactions stored in Arbitrum? Is it like in Ethereum in a patricia merkle trie or is there another method?
undefined says How are the transactions batched by the sequencer? Simply by concatenating the transactions after they have been serialised? I would like to understand the principle of how the transactions are batched and processed by the sequencer.
undefined says The brotli compression algorithm is applied to the serialised and batched transactions, right?
undefined says Another question, are there some testnets where I can test Arbitrum: Delayed Inbox cross-chain contract calls, like goerli => arbGoerli?
undefined says I'm looking at the code to parse the incoming data from the sequencer, but is the file that handles incomingmessage missing from the master branch?

The official documentation has this URL: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/9b1e622102fa2bebfd7dffd327be19f8881f1467/arbos/incomingmessage.go#L61


but I can't see it in the master branch
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbos/incomingmessage.go
undefined says Hey folks, I'm looking to build some dashboards in dune since I realized there's no tool currently that shows L2 to L2 activity
- Swaps, txn vol, unique address between ETH and Stables going to/from ARB > OP or OP > ARB 

I found the optimism token contract list - https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json - is there something equivalent for arbitrum?
undefined says Question, how does Arbitrum prevent the same blockhash from being entered twice? or how is each blockhash unique?
undefined says yeah we use a fork of Geth inside the Arb code base so exactly like Ethereum
undefined says transactions are just sequenced first come first serve; there's a ton of good docs on this here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-sequencer
undefined says yes, the sequencer compresses all calldata before it posts it to L1
undefined says yes, you could do that on Goerli -> Arb Goerli or Sepolia -> Arb Sepolia; or you can run a local dev node and run the tests just on your local machine
undefined says ah yeah looks like that link is referencing an older commit; the file was moved here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbos/arbostypes/incomingmessage.go
undefined says hey there, we don't maintain our own but we aggregate a list from Uniswap, Coinmarketcap and Gemini; but you can reference the URLs listed here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/53c88a477f97ecd4f186c887ed2adeb075e5e356/packages/arb-token-bridge-ui/src/util/TokenListUtils.ts#L62, which is what our bridge uses
undefined says https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_gemini.json https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_coinmarketcap.json https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_uniswap.json if you want the direct json files
undefined says our block hashes are not a reliable source of randomness, if that's your question; there is no guarantee about block hash
undefined says It is September , 1 month (and a half ?) has passed since PUSH0 opcode support was requested , are any good news about when it will be supported? Also, when it will be supported on Sepolia?
undefined says A proposal for the next arbos upgrade including PUSH0 support will be completing audit soon and then it'll be proposed to the DAO for adoption
undefined says I want to know how to get the `Poster Fee`, where can I refer to??
undefined says This is shown in arbiscan on the Advanced TxInfo panel when you're looking at a transaction
undefined says Yes I would like to know more about how the value of poster fee is derived.
undefined says To understand how fees work better, I'd recommend reading this https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#fees
undefined says Here's what I understand so far (in a nutshell)

To pre-calculate the cost from L2 → L1, do the GetPosterGas function (/tx_processor.go)

As I understand it, here charing the cost of the call data paid by the poster, and then after brotli compression, multiplying it by 16 per byte of call data is the poster fee. Right?

And now I'm looking at the l1pricing / l2pricing source code, and I don't know what you have set as `assumptionTxsize = 140` in your arbgasinfo.go.
(I'm guessing that the 140 is the compressed size of the eth_transfer calldata.)
undefined says `assumptionTxsize` is just used for estimating how expensive a transaction might be, it's not used for actual charging
undefined says And yep, it's based on the size of a transfer
undefined says Thanks sir, then What parameters do I need to calculate the poster fee in this contract? https://arbiscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006c#readContract
undefined says If you want to dig into more of the details of how pricing works I'd recommend https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-pricing. If you want to estimate what the L1 fee of a given transaction would be, it recommends using `NodeInterface.gasEstimateL1Component` https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/a1cdec7bce168759a1f21c75831e5b0e4c981833/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L112 which you can call against the node interface contract address `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8`. Note that that precompile can only be called offchain. For an example of doing gas estimation to break the cost into different components, you can also see https://github.com/TucksonDev/arbitrum-scripts/blob/main/src/gas-estimator.ts
undefined says ~~One more question! 
I had some idea about the 6 returns from 15.getPriceInWei() .
1) perL2Tx = `WeiForL1Calldata * assumptionTxsize` = WeiForL1Calldata * 140
2) WeiForL1Calldata = `(L1gasPrice * eip2028)` = L1gasPrice * 16 
3) weiForStoarge(fixed) = `l2gasPrice / storgeWriteGas` = `0.1/20000` = 2000gwei~~
undefined says Oh, thank you. Super Cool 🙂 I didn't check nodeinterface.sol, I'll try to understand it better with the script you shared, thanks.
undefined says I have a question, but the discord is blocking my question, please help me .lol
undefined says - L2GasPrice (P) is fixed at 0.1 gwei (currently).
- L2GasUsed (G) is determined by baseFee of the two gasEstimateComponenets return values in nodeinterface.sol. (gasEstimate - gasEstimateForL1)
undefined says - l1CalldataPricePerByte how caculated?? I don't know what the multiple comments in lines 36-41 of  source code mean.
- L1 Calldata size in bytes (L1S) is the byte size after compression, but I think this also depends on the tx, and I'm using 140bytes as an example.  ← I don't know why it adds 140.
undefined says 
undefined says Fees this cheap? I don't think so. i don't believe it
undefined says Is there a way to directly request the batches via an API ? I wanted to determine the number of transactions per batch and then calculate how much gas a transaction consumes on average/median on the Ethereum blockchain. To do this, I wanted to request the batches, look at the gas charges on the Ethereum blockchain and then divide by the number of transactions in the batch.
undefined says Ah I realized we have a better resource for this I had forgotten about https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says Let me know if that helps clear things up. I think there's a lot cleaner explanations there
undefined says gn,can you help me please, what if I'm sending tx via createRetryableTicket from l1 to l2 and it has been reverted at l2, where does the msg.value goes, is it possible to withdraw it?
undefined says Yes thats clear, but is there any way how can I refund my msg.value that I was sending from l1?
undefined says How can I do it?
undefined says nt bro)
undefined says are there any grants for PWA on arbitrum?
undefined says Sorry if this has been asked before. How long does it take to bridge back a token from Arbitrum to Ethereum? Is there a 7 day wait period?
undefined says This would be a fee on transfer token using the custom gateway.
undefined says It says I don't have access to that channel or server
undefined says warning @here this guy sent me a message pretending he is support and then deleted his messages

@BattleSaw
undefined says Yes, there is 7 day wait period when bridging from L2 to L1 using the official bridge. We can this to the #📬︱support channel
undefined says Thanks! Actually I asked there yesterday and they asked me to come here. Since I'm thinking about a technical integration. That tells me all I need though, thank you.
undefined says Awesome 💙
undefined says Anyone know how to verify smart contracts on stylus?

(I'm assuming it's not possible yet)
undefined says @fred  @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs  edited  - I have regained access.
undefined says @fred my message to you actually bounced back stating that it may be because you are only accepting direct messages from friends. I also sent you a friend request and can verify what I wrote to you from my previous account. Can also go through the verification process I did before if need be. My apologies for the additional hassle here.
undefined says i'm sure this has been asked over and over before, i did search in the server, but i just want to make sure whether i have to create my own ERC20 to experiment with, or if there is a defacto $ARB Test Token on Arbitrum Goerli that we can mint and experiment with ?
undefined says Hey, sorry we don't have a faucet about this on testnet.
undefined says If a ticket with a callvalue is eventually discarded (cancelled or expired), having never successfully run, the escrowed callvalue will be paid out to a `callValueRefundAddress` account that was specified in the initial submission (step 1).
undefined says Hey, is it possible to run Arbitrum Sepolia with `v2.0.14-2baa834`?
undefined says No, it will report Unknown network error, you need use  v2.1.0: https://hub.docker.com/r/offchainlabs/nitro-node/tags
undefined says Yup! I asked it because saw the error you mentioned.

Btw, is it stable to use v2.1.0? There's no official announcement to upgrade v2.1.0 and `beta` in the tag.
undefined says Yup, it is still in beta now, but you can use it as arb-sepolia is also a testnet, and when we release stable verison you can move to that.
undefined says Ok, is `--l1.url` changed?

I used `v2.1.0-beta.16-ad8cfe5` and got `Fatal configuration error: unknown flag: --l1.url`.
undefined says It changes to --parent-chain.connection.url
undefined says Ahhhh tysm! To be honest, it wasn't working, so I've been trying to find the why!
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I've only just seen AIP-7, what does the getPerBatchGasCharge currently found in ArbGasinfo do? It's currently set to 100_000, what would be the difference if it was changed to 200_000?
undefined says how many block number we have to wait in arbitrum until we can say that the transaction is finalised? (Will not be re-orged etc) in arbitrum?
undefined says There's a fixed cost to post a batch that gets amortized across user transactions. The fixed cost was previously too low compared to the actual fixed cost of batch posting so the cost was being slightly undercharged, and AIP-7 fixes that mispricing
undefined says long time no see Sir, doesn't the batch poster cost also include the poster fee?
undefined says Hey! 😁. The poster fee covers the costs to post batches. The per batch gas charge is one of the inputs to the algorithm that decides how much gas to charge for posting costs for your transaction
undefined says There are two options here.
1) Arbitrum blocks are variable speed depending on throughput so relying on block number isn't recommended for finality. If you want a strong guarantee that your transaction is final that doesn't depend on trusting the sequencer, you can query `eth_getBlockByNumber("finalized")` in order to get the latest arbitrum block number that is finalized on ethereum. This happens when a batch is posted to ethereum and then the batch tx gets finality there. This is ex. what exchanges do accepting deposits do and other high security systems where offchain actions are happening based on receiving the payment
2) The more common answer here for a lot of use cases, the Arbitrum sequencer prevents reorgs from occuring on the chain if you trust the sequencer. Reorgs are still possible if bugs occur or the sequencer is dishonest, but don't occur in practice, many people just trust transactions immediately after seeing them as long as they're ok with those risks
undefined says Thanks @Harry | Offchain Labs for the reply
undefined says fr, wat is this? "Connect your wallet and select Arbitrum Sepolia (Note: To receive testnet ETH using this faucet, you must have 0.001 ETH on Ethereum mainnet)." I am trying to get some testnet eth, not get my wallet drained. Is there any other way? If there isnt, can someone verify that this is the correct website https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia ?
undefined says You just have to go to one of these faucets, claim your Sepolia Eth (SepETH). Than bridge it from Ethereum Sepolia to Arbitrum Sepolia and then from Arbitrum Sepolia to Stylus.

undefined says gn,can you help me please, what if I'm sending tx via createRetryableTicket from l1 to l2 and it has been reverted at l2, where does the msg.value goes, is it possible to withdraw it?
undefined says If the execution of the retryable reverted, the ticket is still alive and you can execute it against until it's either executed successfully, been canceled, or expired 7 days after creation. If it's either expired or canceled the value in `msg.value` will be sent to the address specified in the `callValueRefundAddress` address specified on creation. The `callValueRefundAddress` can call the `cancel` method of the `ArbRetryableTx` precompile
undefined says HelloI'm in my last year of university and i'm looking an internship, remote. Is there any possiblity to join?
undefined says Will there been an arbiscan for Arbitrum Sepolia? If yes, any ETA?
undefined says Yes, there will be, but currently we don't have ETA.
undefined says Ok cool. Just asking for my contract verification flow 😉
undefined says Oh, I am not sure about this, but seems we only open full-time now: https://jobs.lever.co/offchainlabs/ee23e189-3bb2-43b2-9801-67664ac3430e
undefined says I came across a list of snapshots for state syncing at this link: https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html. I'm curious about the process behind these snapshots. Are they captured centrally by the Arbitrum Foundation or by third-party service providers they commission? I'd appreciate any insights on this
undefined says This is for a job, no ? I'm not actually looking to get work or get paid. More to do an internship 🙂 If possible of course
undefined says Quick question to devs? Is arbitrum stylus mulithreaded like solana's execution env or does it still run single threaded?
undefined says Is there some article on how does the arbitrum block production work? I am wondering how does the block production compare to Ethereum.
undefined says I'd ask Stylus related questions in the #🖊︱stylus-devs, but to give you a quick response; It’s not yet, but a future version might be
undefined says Thx, will ask there too.
undefined says As I understand it sequencer gets all the transactions, orders them and publishes them to the L1. They are the only one responsible for that kinda work. 

Nitro nodes do not get blocks until the block is posted on the L1 and L1 block is finalised? Also there is no txpool for L2 nodes?
undefined says Arbitrum doesn't have mempool and pending blocks because it works differently from Ethereum when it comes to creating and verifying blocks. Unlike Ethereum, there's no need for nodes to reach a consensus in Arbitrum. Basically, the Sequencer receives transactions and lines them up in a queue. It also bundles and compresses them before sending them to L1 for confirmation. The moment this input data is available (i.e., when the Sequencer posts a batch), the L2 chain's state can be computed. What happens is once the sequencer's batch is finalized on L1, all nodes can deterministically figure out the corresponding L2 block. So nodes use the sequencer feed and read those transactions, run them through the State Transition Function in order and emit new L2 blocks. You can find more info here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle
undefined says When a transaction is flagged as invalid by a validator and the claim is verified on chain that the transaction was invalid, what happens to that transaction?, will it be marked as failed or the system gets rolled back to correct the state?
undefined says First, invalid transactions are things like transactions with wrong signatures or malformed data. These transactions will be either ignored or reversed, just like how Ethereum handles them.
There might be a situation though where a dishonest validator proposes an incorrect state (output of the execution), and that's when a challenge kicks in and fraud proofs come into play. In this case, the validator who posted the right outcome (state root) in their assertion will win the dispute. The challenge system can simplify the dispute down to a single step that happens on L1. You can learn more about this here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/proving/challenge-manager
undefined says Thanks for the quick reply @Mahsa | Offchain Labs , So when the validator block is proved to be incorrect, lets say the block was 100 and the chain was at 190 when the incorrect claim was verified, will the chain be reset to 99 since 100 was wrong ?
undefined says Those RBlocks that claim to follow the rejected blocks will eventually be rejected because their predecessor has already been rejected. But note that the protocol resolves RBlocks in RBlock number order, so the protocol will have to resolve 100 before it can resolve next ones.
undefined says Okay thanks @Mahsa | Offchain Labs
undefined says I am a web 3 dev that is new to working with L2. What happens to ETH that hasn't gone through the bridge that is sent to a smart contract address that was deployed on Arbitrum?
undefined says Sorry sir, I can't find the "Incentive Grant Applications" Category. Am I looking in the right place?
undefined says Hmm, sorry, you might lose those token, since l2 contract can not control it related l1 address
undefined says https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-to-apply-arbitrum-short-term-incentives-program/16545
undefined says when executing transactions in hardhat, eth_estimateGas works almost flawlessly, but when running the same transactions on Arbitrum Sepolia testnet 50% of my transactions fail with "insufficient gas" error. Is there any special consideration I should take when estimating gas for Arbitrum?
undefined says It's difficult to debug without looking at your code, but in Arbitrum, L2 gas usage depends on the L1 gas price too (more info here: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 ), so if there's a gap of time between the moment you do the estimation and the moment you send the transaction, you risk it being rejected due to insufficient gas.
Also, spikes of gas price in L1 affect the L2 and sometimes it's necessary to add some buffer to the estimation to prevent potential low-gas errors.
undefined says ok, seems to me I will have to add a static increment gasLimit by say 30% or something like that. thanks!
undefined says Will https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc ever be completely reliable or is the expectation that users pay for a 3rd party RPC provider?
undefined says https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc is a public rpc node, I think it should be relatively reliable.
undefined says Hey clipe..like I posted in general.. Looking for any info on the post tech team or devs and if anyone here from Arbitrum know the team or have supported them
undefined says Hey, as clipe mentioned, the plan is to have that public RPC be as reliable and efficient as possible, but keep in mind that there are plenty of users connecting to it. If you need an RPC to handle more heavy operations or something specific that needs some tight guarantees for your use case, you might want to look at some 3rd party providers.
undefined says right now, is there a single sequencer instance? or multiple ?
(i know it's centralized, the question is if there's multiple servers running from separate datacenters etc.)
undefined says It has been reliable for the longest time since I can remember, but for the last few days, it's been iffy, again:
`858 block_watcher.go:123] blockwatch.Watcher error encountered - trying again on next polling interval err="429 Too Many Requests: {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":429,\"message\":\"Too Many Requests\"}}\n"`
undefined says The cheapest one's I know start at $25/month and my project doesn't generate anywhere close to that revenue to afford it sadly
undefined says There was a partial degradation issue in the sequencer feed endpoint yesterday, and your log seems to suggest it was affected by it (this didn't affect nodes, but connections to the sequencer feed endpoint).
Let me cc @Sneaky , @RyanWang  and @hyd3c who also asked about it yesterday (and I forgot to reply back).
undefined says Reconnecting to the feed seems to have solved the issue yesterday for the ones who were affected by it, but we have identified and solved the core issue anyway.
undefined says There's a complex infrastructure behind it, yeah, with multiple layers of security, load balancing, etc.
undefined says Restarting our nodes does not appear to fix it:
`Fri 2023-09-22 18:44:33 IST livepeer[401618]: E0922 18:44:33.412483  401618 block_watcher.go:123] blockwatch.Watcher error encountered - trying again on next polling interval err="429 Too Many Requests: {\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"error\":{\"code\":429,\"message\":\"Too Many Requests\"}}\n"`

FWIW, the Asia nodes seem to be see that error, the NA nodes have recovered
undefined says 🙋🏻‍♀️
undefined says so, if i subscribe to the sequencer feed, it means it will decide the best server to connect to, right ?
undefined says Can it be a networking issue? We don't have any region based filters in place.
undefined says No, there's only one endpoint available
undefined says The API error states `Too many requests`, doesn't sound like a networking issue? There are no networking issues on the machine, we looked
undefined says Thanks @José FP | Offchain Labs! Just want to be clear though. Reconnecting did not fix it for me. I had to get an new IP address for it to work.
undefined says and this was my node connecting to the sequencer, not me hitting the RPC.
undefined says Oh, right. Thanks for clarifying.
undefined says The only way of getting a 429 error is to make too many requests to the endpoint so your requests are rejected for a few seconds. Are you making more requests to that endpoint from other sources that use the same IP?
In any case, we don't have any geographical filters in place, that's why it's weird that your nodes in NA are working and the ones in Asia are not if they use the same configuration.
undefined says I'm the founder of a web3 software development company with focus on blockchain technology. Currently, we are acquiring new clients, so we are looking for on-call developers especially familiar with node.js and solidity.
Please fill out the following short form if you’re interested
https://forms.gle/ri2US2YNLybpSZ318
undefined says its possible to have messages between l2 to l1, but is it possible on chain to have messages between arbitrum one and arbitrum nova?
undefined says I tried turning the Asia nose off for a few minutes, I can turn it off for an hour and retry. Nothing else from that IP is using the RPC, the IP is static though and geo filtering is what came to my mind first too
undefined says Yeah I think so
undefined says do you know where i can find more info about it? couldnt find it in the docs
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust
undefined says so i read it from the inbox, there i will be able to read for example arbitrum one data on arbitrum nova from last time it was sent to l1?
undefined says hey there. I posted this question in #research, but was recommended to post here: https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1045177702170247248/1155272101033431061

undefined says Hey guys, I need some archive data from some Arbitrum contracts, I'm guessing the only way to get it is to run an archive node myself or to use a 3rd party provider. Is there any solution ? (running an archive node is too much and 3rd party providers are slow + limited).

I know I'm asking the moon but that would be so awesome if there was an alternative allowing to get some archive contract state easily

undefined says pro
undefined says :arbiblobblue:
undefined says Helloo, i wanted to ask about MEVs attacks in Arbitrum, i heard that is not possible. can you explain more please?
undefined says We don't have a mempool for the incoming transactions, instead we have a queue on our sequencer that keeps track of received transactions. Our sequencer will pick transactions based on the order in the queue (first come first served). So based on the way the system works, it is not sensitive to MEV considerations. For more details I’d encourage you to watch this very interesting talk by our chief scientist (Ed Felten) on this topic:

undefined says Hey guys 
Anyone knows the Nova api url?
undefined says lol
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/public-chains
undefined says how to build nitro from source?
undefined says https://nova.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Maybe you can find it from nova's official website
undefined says I also want to know
undefined says thank you
undefined says Word
undefined says hey
undefined says arber
undefined says cool
undefined says If I run an Arbitrum Nitro node in watchtower mode, can I get access to the pre-Nitro blockchain data?
undefined says Hey, the Nitro node databases have the raw data of all blocks, including pre-Nitro blocks. However, Nitro nodes cannot execute anything on pre-Nitro blocks
undefined says So for the purpose of just querying pre-Nitro blocks, nitro node does the job. Is that correct?
undefined says That's right!
undefined says what will happen if someone spams transactions to the network?
undefined says Send txn needs gas, this is the method to prevent attackers spam txn.
undefined says Have something like blocking or blacklisting if someone spams?
undefined says Our sequencer doesn’t censor tx, but our public rpc has request limit. Also, we set the gas used limit per second, currently is 7m/s, and for each tx, the gas limit is 32m.
undefined says btw, mempool is not available on arbitrum, right?
undefined says You can get those here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L80
undefined says Right, not available, we use first in first serve method.
undefined says so, this means that it is impossible to detect a pending transaction, right?
undefined says can I see the queue of transactions before they were executed?
undefined says I don’t think we have this rpc (mempool) which can be requested by public.
undefined says thank you so much
undefined says btw, how about running a node?
undefined says If I run a node, is it possible to see pending transactions?
undefined says Block is produced by sequencer, not fulllnode,fullnode can only forward tx to sequencer, you can see what tx your forward by running a node in theory.
undefined says that means if I run a fullnode, I can theoretically see the queue of pending transactions, right?
undefined says But there is also some others tx not forwarded by your node
undefined says Pending tx only exist on cache, won’t be so long and won’t be so many, because we don’t have mempool, so if there are tons of tx coming to sequencer, sequencer will reject them based on timeout.
undefined says I am running a nova node and I would like to run some analytics on local node db. Can somebody tell me the difference between l2chaindata and arbitrumdata? If it is document somewhere, I couldn't find.
undefined says am trying to set up and rum Arbitrum full node by following the instruction but the connection to L1 keeps being denied. I have my own Ethereum full node, so for l1.url I used localhost:8545. Anyone knows what might be the problem?
undefined says Hey guys, how many validators are there in Arbitrum?
undefined says arbitrum
undefined says Good day everyone, who do I talk to about cross chain bridge integration?
And potentially how arbitrum will use EIP-4844, so trustless bridges can treat it's blob commitments as a finality proof
undefined says is the gas limit also 32 million on nova?

working on a game that might push into the 10s of millions of gas per txn 🥴
undefined says `l2chaindata` is what geth code is pointing to. It stores blocks, transactions, receipts, state in the same format that geth uses.
`arbitrumdata` stores data only used by our code: mostly the messages read from either feed or l1, and some stored data like last validated block. Please note that these current formats are subject to future changes
undefined says https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvyDnaPaJB
undefined says AMA: Web3 Gaming: Year in Review & What’s Next? @Treasure_DAO
undefined says Yes, it’s also 32m on nova
undefined says You can add —network host when you start your node
undefined says Can I just assume l2chaindata is like ethereum local db data(format wise)? I am following this gist: https://gist.github.com/vs9390/b6646abdaaccaa551c780bf97c687a1e. It is written for ethereum.
undefined says I think not. Is there any doc that you can point out which explains how to decode local db data or should I dive into arbitrum repository?
undefined says when arbitrum token going launch?
undefined says Arbitrum has no token, beware of scams
undefined says 
undefined says I don't think we provide support on this matter
undefined says @avci hey
undefined says Hey guys, I would like to use arbitrum sequencer feed through wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed, and it returns data like this:

```

I would like to parse the data in l2Msg part, how can I do it? What is the structure in it?
undefined says I found the function `parseL2Message` in `nitro/arbos/incomingmessage.go` file. I isolated that function and tried to run it with the upper example data on my local but I am getting `unkown L2 message kind 65` error. Can somebody help me here?
undefined says wow
undefined says Congratulations 🎉. The great for future and looking interesting amazing project
undefined says I am a data scientist with software dev exp (not directly in solidity), which Dao or projects in OP should I check out to potentially help out?

undefined says That's right!
undefined says Maybe not. but i will check more for you
undefined says I found one 🙂 https://twitter.com/RandomizerAi
undefined says Great
undefined says What data did you pass into `parseL2Message` ? I look your example and your L2 message kind should be 04 which is `L2MessageKind_SignedTx`
undefined says I passed the "l2Msg" part as it is in the example to `parseL2Message` function. The function takes the first byte of the l2 message and treat it as the kind but it is 65. How did you find 04?
undefined says When you use base64 to decode that `L2MSG`, you will see 0x04 on the first byte.
undefined says I'm trying to setup Arb Nitro mode through docker
I have volume mapped /home/user/.arbitrum
But container stops with error 
Mkdir: /home/user/.arbitrum/arb1 permission denied

I have given permissions to the volume mapping directory using chmod 777

Can you please help me set up the node
undefined says I have some questions regarding the Arbitrum one protocol and I hope I can get answers to my questions. Based on the Arbitrum doc: “after receiving a transaction the sequencer will order it in its off-chain box and then locally execute it and instantly give a transaction receipt to the client”:
1.    What is the transaction ordering mechanism for the sequencer? 
2.    What is the average waiting time of each transaction before execution? 
3.    In case we trust the sequencer, can we consider the execution time of the transaction equal to the time of its finalization?
4.    How we can get access to the execution time of transactions on the sequencer node?
undefined says 1- The sequencer will pick the incoming transactions on the first come first served order 
2- Most of the time the sequencer’s queue is empty since and txs are sequenced immediately
3- The sequencer does not execute the txs. But we can consider the tx final when the sequencer posts the batch on L 
4- The sequencer only batches the txs, compresses them, and posts the batch on L1. Referring to what you posted from our docs; it does locally execute the txs to collect related L1 and L2 fees, etc. But the execution of the txs are done offchain by the validators (and that’s why its low cost!)
undefined says Thanks for your response. So, for example, when I send a uniswap trade on L2, can I consider the execution time on validator nodes as the time the trade happened on L2?
If the answer is yes, is there any available log events for transactions that executed on validators?
Another question is that what is the Arbiscan timestam? can we consider the timestamp as the execution time of transactions?
undefined says Sequencer can order tx, and if tx is ordered which means their state is confirmed, anyone can get that order and execute it, this is why when you send a tx to arbitrum network, you can get a instant result.

undefined says Hey guys. I have been using the arbitrum bridge for some time now. Love the product. I had one doubt though, how many validators are there?
undefined says We have recorded this on this contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef0d09d1e6204141b4d37530808ed19f60fba35#writeProxyContract , also we have `watchover validators` which doesn’t record on it, and anyone can be a watchover.
undefined says The inside-arbitrum-nitro introduce the Staking mechanism: at any given time, validators can deposit funds to become stakers. So can we check these staking stats?
undefined says Also you can get their stats on this contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5ef0d09d1e6204141b4d37530808ed19f60fba35#readProxyContract
undefined says who are some of the best folks in the arbitrum ecosystem? any idea?

undefined says Hey guys! Currently trying to understand how I can access arbitrum's state (roots) from L1.

So far I understand that every couple mins the `SequencerInbox` by calling `addSequencerL2Batch[FromOrigin]`. I would like to better understand the parameters of this call, specially `data`.

I also understand the the `SequencerInbox` calls the `Bridge` to enqueue the messages, and it also seems that the `Bridge` is storing all this info `sequencerInboxAccs`, so I assume that the L2 state must be somehow stored there, but it's not clear to me how the information is stored and what information is exactly being stored.

I looked into the docs and the whitepaper and this thing are not yet super clear to me, so I would appreciate some help 😄
undefined says Interesting, would like to hear more about this aswell..
undefined says Have Arbitrum smart contracts been audited? If yes, please provide links.
undefined says any devs working with erc3664 ?
undefined says :b671f123e82f8171cde8a010f0689a90:
undefined says You can know how sequencer send batches to l1 and what the batches are here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#sequencing-followed-by-deterministic-execution , and l1 doesn’t store the state of l2, only the hash of the state: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/rollup/Node.sol#L9
undefined says Henlo I am daPanda from lexer.markets
I want to learn more about hosting our own arbitrage node. Is there anyone I can DM and talk to?💙 🧡
undefined says I want to query arbitrum transactions and block info using my own arbitrum node (it is up and running). Can someone tell me what the best way/tool is? It seems like web3.js does not support arbitrum network.
undefined says feel free to follow our docs if you want to run your own node: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node. We're happy to answer any questions you have here or in #💻︱protocol
undefined says are you specifically looking to query specific block numbers (if so, how are you selecting which block numbers to look at) or are there smart contract event/transactions that you're interested in keeping track of?
undefined says I am doing research on transaction fees and demands on Arbitrum and mainnet. So the query will be blocks, transactions and other specs that span a certain time period.
undefined says Hello!
I have registered on the Arbitrum forum, but I do not receive a message from the disco bot to start training.
undefined says Could someone answer this question? why it is blocked?
undefined says you are using the banned word H I
undefined says good
undefined says Don't include "h  i" in your post
undefined says web3js and ethers both supports Arbitrum. For instance we used ethers in our tutorials repo:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials
undefined says I just wrote up a detailed post on setting up and running your own Arbitrum node from scratch (hardware, operating system, software installation etc,) based on my own journey of the process last month. If anyone is interested, you can check out this post: https://hackmd.io/@EagleEdge/B1wnRW5Di I hope this will be helpful for anyone who is interested in running their Arbitrum node
undefined says Guys which dex is more important on arbitrum?
undefined says Maybe uniswap and sushi swap
undefined says these questions should be moved to #💬︱general or #🌐︱defi-chat ; please keep the developer channels focused on technical questions
undefined says hey Zhi, did you happen to dig further into our docs regarding these questions: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/assertion-tree
undefined says Arbitrum has no token, beware of scams
undefined says https://arbitrum.chat - this is gpt3 chat over arbitrum docs. I made it.
undefined says Hey Arbitrum devs, I'm a smart contract security researcher. Can anyone here give me some guidance on how to deploy the Nitro bridge contracts to a localhost test net? I'd like to do some fuzzing to look for vulnerabilities with the bridge, though first I want to make sure the fuzzer can detect a known bug from an older commit, e.g. the one 0xriptide found and reported in September.
undefined says @webthethird deploying the Nitro Bridge contracts to a localhost testnet can be done using a tool such as Truffle. You can start by cloning the Nitro Bridge contracts repository from GitHub, then use Truffle to compile and migrate the contracts to your local testnt
undefined says Is there a deploy script or something along those lines that will deploy everything in the correct order? I've deployed contracts via Truffle/Hardhat/Forge before, but I've reviewed the Nitro Bridge contracts and there are a lot of interdependent parts. It would be great if there is a script I could run that sets up the entire protocol.
undefined says @webthethird https://developer.arbitrum.io/
undefined says @NPC been there, didn't see any instructions on deploying the Nitro Bridge to a testnet... anyone else have more specific advice?
undefined says @webthethird yes, there is a script provided in the nitro bridge contracts repository that can deploy the entire protocol to a local testnet. The script is called deploy-local.sh and is located in the scripts directory of the repository. the script uses Truffle and Hardhat to deploy the contracts in the correct order, and it also sets up the required infrastructure for the Nitro protocol such as an ECDSA signature verifier a deposit manager and a nitro Adjudicator
undefined says Great, that's the answer I was looking for, thank you
undefined says Only, I don't see it there... I'm looking in nitro/contracts/scripts/ and all I see is `build.bash`
undefined says @NPC got a link?
undefined says We could not do it on arbiscan.io and we are getting an error. It's not improving.
undefined says 
undefined says very cool @zoybergoziuz , I'll share this with the team
undefined says You want `test-node.bash`: https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/local-dev-node, it deploys everything
undefined says @ChrisCo | Offchain Labs thank you, I think @NPC might've been trolling me
undefined says ????????
undefined says I hope it will gane users and devs attention as much as it deserve. It was hard to build, so i hope it will be useful
undefined says Can i create thread it ecosystem channel?

I heve no permission to do that.
undefined says Does anyone know **how to calculate or get a token's price from a uniswap v3 contract?** It is simple with the old traditional LP contract but I don't know how to the that with this -relatively- new concentrated LP contracts
undefined says You can find the path for this token to USDC/USDT/DAI, then see the ratio.
undefined says phoenix
undefined says Hey everyone, I just submitted EIP-6160. This EIP introduces new interfaces that token contracts must inherit which provides trustless bridge contracts with the necessary APIs for native token bridging.

https://twitter.com/seunlanlege/status/1620401195008561152
undefined says @Arshia
undefined says 🤝
undefined says Created a thread in the research forum to discuss this standard:

https://research.arbitrum.io/t/eip-6160-multi-chain-native-tokens/7011
undefined says feedback for you: don't link to a Github PR to explain your EIP.  I know that's how they get considered for inclusion but that blog post should probably mirror that content or at least summarize it. Reading raw markdown with random failures from Github actions, etc is pretty distracting
undefined says Thanks for the feedback 🙏 , I linked both the blog post and the EIP for the full specification for those interested.

I should have the example contract out soon as well.
undefined says right, but the blog post itself covers Motivation and Security Considerations, but then leaves it up to the reader to jump through links to put the pieces together. You should put the pieces together for the reader
undefined says I can fix that
undefined says thanks for the pointers
undefined says I've updated the blog, the proposed interfaces themselves are pretty simple: https://research.polytope.technology/eip-6160:-multi-chain-native-tokens
undefined says it's an improvement, but it still needs work. Naming the interfaces does little without expanding and defining the interfaces it inherits from. Don't make the reader / reviewer do the work. Put all the details in the EIP.  See: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337 for an example of a good, well formatted EIP.
undefined says > Naming the interfaces does little without expanding and defining the interfaces it inherits from

Will simplify it a bit further
undefined says simple, in this case, is not better. Expand your definitions, show a full contract interface with inheritance stripped out, etc: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777
undefined says how to read the sequencer?
undefined says Hey, you can follow the instructions here to read messages from the Sequencer feed: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says what's the best resource for standing up a non-validator node in the cloud?
undefined says We're running a node on Hetzner (although they are quite strict with crypto related stuff)
undefined says thanks... yeah, I'm looking for a good resource to walk through the steps. Not interested in a "archive" node just yet, as a "snap" node is all I need right now
undefined says Not sure if this is the right place to ask..., but does Arbitrum plan to store the complete history of blob data (even after it is pruned on L1) after EIP-4844 is implemented?
undefined says good question, that's something that is still highly in flux right now so even if I could provide you an answer right now it might be subject to change. We'll have more on it as blob data gets closer to rolling out
undefined says You can find instructions on how to setup a node in this page: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
Let us know if you run into any problems or have any specific question about the process.
undefined says what does the contract storage refer to
undefined says 
undefined says thanks, i have not understad if i need to run that in the same machine i'm running an arb node? or do i need to start the node with additional parameters so it get sequencer feed too?
undefined says did u read my question lol
undefined says that refers to the rollup smart contract's stored data on L1
undefined says What is the protocol revenue on Arbitrum generated  from ?
undefined says Arbitrum charges gas fees in terms of ETH for usage of the platform; we try to keep gas as low as possible, so usually a small margin of profit vs what we spend to settle data to L1 and maintain infrastructure
undefined says Since Arbitrum basically live son Ethereum as a smart contract.
 Is it possible to read the state from the contract deployed on Arbitrum from Ethereum contract?

I would like to read a variable from the contract deployed on Arbitrum and use it for some calculations on Ethereum.
undefined says Arbitrum and Ethereum can talk to each other using our Bridge. You can send a message from Ethereum to Arbitrum which takes almost 15 mins to receive it on Arbitrum.
You also can send a message from Arbirtrum to Ethereum, but this path will take 7 days to pass challenge period which is needed on optimistic rollups
undefined says So the answer to your question is kinda yes, but it takes 7 days.
undefined says hey, from where can i get the bridge addresses that bridge USDC from Ethereum to Arbitrum?
undefined says Hey Ab, not sure what you mean. 
- If you need to bridge USDC, you can use our bridge => https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
- If you are looking for the contract that handles the bridging operation, you can query the Gateway Router ( its address is in: https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses#token-bridge ). USDC goes through our Generic Custom Gateway.
Let me know if you need more info about it.
undefined says We could make our own oracle to interact with arbitrum from ethereum smart contract. Or I miss something here?
undefined says You can make an oracle to do this if you trust your oracle.
undefined says 
undefined says I have a node running on achemy but now my VPS is full, now I want to switch to a new VPS, how do I do that?
undefined says Currently running mev inspect py on Arbitrum, what's your question?
undefined says Do you know of any MEV PFOF solution that acts as an intermediary between the users and the Arbitrum sequencer?
undefined says hey 0x, we can't offer support or recommend any particular MEV solution, sorry
undefined says ❤️
undefined says have any rng/vrf provider on arbitrum ?
undefined says and what are your suggestions for marketing and community building?
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Hello! I'm interested in syncing an Arbitrum archive node for research purposes. Is there any guidance on how to do this? Does Erigon support this?
undefined says And how long should I expect this to take, how much disk space will I need?
undefined says https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says This might help you.
undefined says Thank you. Do you know if that docker image is running an Erigon archive node behind the scenes?
undefined says Hey, API3 provides source of randomness on Arbitrum ( https://docs.api3.org/qrng/reference/chains.html ) using their QRNG project.
http://randomizer.ai/ is another smaller project which provides randomness, or you can even use Ethereum mainnet’s RANDAO and send it to L2.
undefined says thanks, i wanted clarity about something

i found bridge address of USDC/USDT/DAI/WETH in the arbiscan end

for a token to bridge from Ethereum mainnnet to Arbitrum mainnet the funds gets locked in the Ethereum end and gets transferred from an Arbitrum native address into the bridge contract address

is this flow accurate? is so, what are the addresses through which the aforementioned assets gets transferred into the bridge contract address?
undefined says @surgeonWeb3 , STOP. That's a SCAM.
undefined says If you entered your seed phrase there, your wallet is compromised
undefined says what, no
undefined says Please move your funds and assets to another secure wallet as soon as possible. Generate a new seed phrase, don't use the same seed as before.
undefined says I cant
undefined says NOOOO
undefined says I lost all
undefined says Create a new wallet, with a different seed phrase, then move your assets to your new wallet. Check all networks where you had assets (Arbitrum, Ethereum, etc)
undefined says i don't have eth to tansfer
undefined says can you block this wallet
undefined says in arbitrum
undefined says please
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says my life is broken. I'm from Turkey, and the first I lost my home and now all my assets....
undefined says I am very sorry this happened to you. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do in these situations. Remember to never share your seed phrase or private key with anyone. If you're ever in doubt about any message posted here, always ask first and wait for an answer from a team member or support member.
undefined says @surgeonWeb3 , it looks like the scammer wallet has interacted with Binance in the past. One thing you can do is report the scam to them, in case they try to send the funds there.
undefined says This wallet was mine, but I have about 51 transactions in arbitrum. And I delete it, because lost my seed
undefined says Hey Ab,
I think this page can help you => https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging . It explains the whole Token Bridging process. Depending on the bridge used, assets will go through one L2 gateway or another. If you want to know the L2 gateway for a specific token, you can use method "getGateway" on the L1 router to get the L1 Gateway used for that token ( https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef#readProxyContract#F4 ) and then use counterpartGateway() on the L1 Gateway to get the address of the L2 Gateway.
undefined says Thanks jose, for now i am trying to look for bridging between ethereum and arbitrum


Can you clear something for me, to identifying the flow of assets into arbitrum there is weth gateway and erc20 one which are clear

In what condition is the custom gateway used? For my query, is it just enough to look at erc20 and weth gateways?
undefined says You have different ways of bridging an ERC20, depending on the use case. You can use the standard bridge (for tokens that are not registered on a Gateway), the custom-generic bridge (for tokens that have special needs and have an L2 counterpart contract are registered on a gateway) or, on rare occasions, even special gateways if your use case is very unique (for example, the WETH gateway).
I encourage you to take a look at this page, as it covers your questions and more information into bridging ETH and ERC20 tokens => https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging
undefined says @surgeonWeb3 We’re sorry for any grievances you’ve incurred. Any scams encountered can be reported to #🆘︱scam-reporting , however we can’t assist in retrieval of funds, and we kindly ask you to not solicit in the Discord. Wish you luck 🙏🏽💙🧡
undefined says 
undefined says How much L1 fees are paid per tx on Arbitrum? And within that L1 fee, how much of it goes to calldata? What are the fixed L1 costs on each transaction/batch?
undefined says what are the primary dexs on arb?
undefined says you can find the list of dexes here: https://portal.arbitrum.one/#swapping
undefined says L1 fees can vary depending on L1 gas price and the amount of calldata a particular transaction uses. The majority of it goes to calldata. What do you mean by fixed costs? Each transaction and batch varies depending on Ethereum base fee and amount of calldata in that particular batch. 
See: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/faqs/gas-faqs#q-gas-l1 and https://developer.offchainlabs.com/faqs/gas-faqs for more info
undefined says I imagine there would be at least some fixed cost associated with posting state roots per tx?
undefined says For example in Optimism, besides gas spent on calldata, there are additional gas spent on posting state roots after applying every tx and other overheads
undefined says thanks, i had read that source before i messaged you here; i just wanted to be sure if i was correct on identifying the flows of tokens
undefined says Continuing from links above: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-pricing -  there is a small / optional reward added for batch posters. State roots are posted roughly every 30-60 minutes via the Rollup contracts
undefined says Using 0xbd80d757f7b53ccc7d8a8bc6d764130485280fd47e082cad95c021ad642ba4e2 as an example, does anyone know why there are no corresponding traces for this transaction?
undefined says I'm not sure I understand. Are you searching that transaction?
https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xbd80d757f7b53ccc7d8a8bc6d764130485280fd47e082cad95c021ad642ba4e2
undefined says I can find the data of the transaction in this link https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xbd80d757f7b53ccc7d8a8bc6d764130485280fd47e082cad95c021ad642ba4e2, but the same tx_hash is in https://arbiscan.io/vmtrace?txhash=0xbd80d757f7b53ccc7d8a8bc6d764130485280fd47e082cad95c021ad642ba4e2 This page shows abnormal data
undefined says Hey, let me take a deeper look into this and I'll get back to you
undefined says we didn't use Geth on the first version of Arbitrum, so the Geth VM trace tool on Arbiscan will not work for legacy transactions
undefined says I develop contracts in Rust for WASM. @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs could you DM me/add as friend? I'd take you max 10 minutes.
undefined says Does anyone in here know how I can calculate programmitacally buy taxes and sell taxes of a token?
undefined says You could take a look at our portal:
https://portal.arbitrum.one/#cryptotaxes
undefined says 🤔🤔🤔
undefined says Just a question, do you know which dex do we need to use on arbitrum goerli testnet ?
undefined says Can we use Abitrum Logo in a collection as A trait?
undefined says dex
undefined says 🔥 🔥 🔥
undefined says 👍
undefined says Please tell me how it can be that there is only outgoing 1 tx of eth from the wallet. And how he materialized there is no trace. And the second. The outgoing transaction has no fee paid

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1e189a1549d2489b44b47113e8292c40453a920a
undefined says Did you confirm this transaction yourself?
undefined says That's representing an L1 deposit from https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9837e2b4d0207a03fa1bfd094a92033656290bbcb00f39c44f3b9058330abe51
undefined says In L1 Smart Contract, can I perform a verification using the Merkle tree root in L1 for my L2 smart contracts state?
undefined says there's no way to do that synchronously. You could have your L2 smart contract periodically send an L2 to L1 message that would include a merkle root, which your L1 contract could then reference, but it takes 7 days for those to be confirmed on L1
undefined says it might be possible with a trusted oracle of some kind
undefined says Thanks for you answers!
How does having a trusted Oracle help?
undefined says if you have a trusted oracle that can provide the latest L2 tree root to the L1 contract, then the L1 contract could defer to that value in whatever method call it's doing. This has some security implications of course, as the oracle is placed in a position of trust and has the potential to manipulate the value or fail to report the value in a timely manner, etc.  You could architect that in such a way as either 1) the oracle periodically writes the L2 state root to the L1 smart contract (maybe once a day or week or whatever your needs are) or 2) the L1 smart contract "pauses" or awaits the oracle's latest answer before continuing execution. Chainlink's VRF functionality works in this way, as an example to reference
undefined says AWESOME! Appreciate your very detailed explanation 😄
undefined says jjj
undefined says pls help me fix this
undefined says logs file now
undefined says Hey!
A couple of things about your issue:
- You need a few more parameters in the docker run command to open the WS ports. See here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node#important-ports
- Keep in mind that the ports you're specifying (8597, 8598) are not the standard ones (8547, 8548)
- You should wait until the node is fully synced before start working with it
undefined says Thank you
I will proceed to add ws once it's synced
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs just interested on something you posted on the fb discord:
"We'd prefer to allow >1 per IP for people running a couple nodes. We're rolling out improvements there too. But the scale of unique IPs we're seeing is still way too high.
There's both a high infrastructure cost and engineering cost to supporting that much traffic"

Lets say (very big if) that all the unique IPs are from valid nodes subscribing to the feed - doesn't this imply there is a scalability cap to the current setup (i.e. cost of running infrastructure). Is there a future whereby arbitrum does start collecting fees or something whereby this cost can be covered in order for network stabilization or something like decentralising the sequencer design?
undefined says as based on my current understanding, this issue would seem to be consistent (without additional support compared to now) as arbitrum grows.
undefined says I mean, we do support the current level of load, which which btw is well over the number of Ethereum nodes https://www.ethernodes.org/
undefined says We're making this change both to future-proof, and reduce infrastructure and engineering costs
undefined says Why not implement this;
Make a second searcher relay, public relay gets a 50ms delay, and searcher relay is restarted daily and only allows connections during the first 5 mins of the day, avoids constant reconnect spam, and have an easy path to intermediate monetization by charging some $ amount for access to that relay, which covers its operating cost
undefined says There's reconnect spam and also the sheer number of concurrent connections that can cause issues
undefined says You don't have reconnect spam if you only allow connections during a very short timeframe
undefined says Yeah but you have concurrent connection issues
undefined says And by having the searcher relay do FIFO transaction sending you can literally limit connections to some arbitrary number like 1k or even charge per IP and ratelimit based on that
undefined says Again, the issue there is the number of concurrent connections, not the reconnect rate
undefined says yeah for sure but I think we can both agree that arbitrum is still evolving and it seems like there is an identified issue around the concurrent connections/reconnections. Which from experience is a hard problem to solve without throwing hardware at it
undefined says Do keep in mind that we have a long-term solution which is this https://research.arbitrum.io/t/transaction-ordering-policy/127
undefined says yeah - same
undefined says Definitely room for improvement, but not enough room for improvement that we wouldn't need something else
undefined says will the block time increase? Since wouldn't this also be a race to get into the block timing (I've just skimmed so sorry if I have missed something vital)
undefined says You make a secondary relay, that doesn't have random ordering but first connected first served.
^ solves number of concurrent connections, can even cut all connections after the first 100/1000/ some other arbitrary number (since they'll be too slow to be competitive anyway)
You restart that secondary relay daily, it either allows connections up to the limit or based on a fixed 5/10/20 minute interval, after that no more connections and you reject any requests/connection attempts with 400 or something
If number of concurrent connections to that relay really are a problem you just change the cutoff, i.e. max 1k total connections before cutoff
undefined says We did consider that but it causes a race to be the first to connect at restart, which may result in many parallel connections at that time. That solution is good but from our perspective our proposed solution seems better.
undefined says You will still have a lot of connections with your proposed solution, as has been discussed in the FB channel, people with dedicated mining setups will likely launch thousands of "good enough" nonce connections because it slows down competition
undefined says My current thought process is that short term we'll move to the nonce system, medium term we'll consider paying the sequencer for a faster relay connection, and long term we'll adopt a transaction ordering auction as planned
undefined says That depends on how long you need to delay competitors before it becomes not worth it because you've gotten everything yourself. We might need to adjust the parameters accordingly.
undefined says yeah - it will be interesting to see it play out but
undefined says There won't be just be one Competition
undefined says since I can def. see advantage in taking the connections to force everyone out
undefined says Its nuissanced, you're playing against everyone else thats equally sophisticated
undefined says The cutoff isn't at #1 takes the spot
undefined says The cutoff is #1 of bot type 1 takes the spot of all bot type 1's, #1 of bot type 2 takes the spot of all bot type 2's etc.
undefined says And the bot type with the most $ will quickly dominate the privileged 25/50 slot spot
undefined says And all other bot types will resort to the "blind nonce spam auction"
undefined says And launch as many connections as possible with decent nonces, because the cost is almost none while still being a menace to competitors
undefined says well the nonce will only really impact the first 25 right? Afterwards its broadcasted to everyone so no real point, which hopefully does reduce the spam (although I can image on switch over there will be a major spike)
undefined says Its ordered, nonce will impact everyone as far as I understand, there is just an extra delay after 25, but that extra delay is only really relevant for the very most competitive bot operator, all others are (still) incentivized to launch as many decent nonce connections as possible
undefined says It's all about profitability at the end of the day. Your mev needs to be worth the amount you're spending on hashrate.
undefined says ah right
undefined says @Lee Bousfield | Offchain Labs little of please do this (sorry) - but once implemented and running for sometime I would be really keen to see an article / stats on how it all played out
undefined says I can't promise anything but we'll definitely consider that 🙂 I agree with what you and other have mentioned which is that transparency into the top nonce hashes should improve the efficiency of the market
undefined says I am wondering if the project(Arbi bridge, etc) has been audited.
Here it says: "have been audited by several independent firms".
Could someone send me the audit report. I did not manage to find it.
undefined says Hey, Our contracts are audited indeed,  but the audit reports are not public.
undefined says there is a leak in the nova network 1 dollar  56 dollar  is the team aware of this
undefined says If this is about rcpswap (the image you posted on general), it means there's very few liquidity in that pool. It doesn't have anything to do with Nova, but with that protocol: RCPSwap.
undefined says Hey! I was running arbitrum archive node. For initial blocks, eth_getBlock by number is working fine but following rpc call called debug_traceBlockByNumber isnt working. Please Help!! What could be the reason for it?
undefined says A couple of questions about it:
- Can you send the full command you're using to run the node?
- Did you use any snapshot when syncing your node?
undefined says 1){"method":"debug_traceBlockByNumber","params":["0x3c",{"tracer":"callTracer"}],"id":7634578,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}
2)The snapshot that docker image downloads itself. Thats it. No additional screenshot
undefined says Thanks, can you also send the full docker run command? (hide any provider's keys you might be using)
undefined says docker compose up with --l1.url <l1-url> --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=*  --node.caching.archive --init.url="https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/nitro.tar"
undefined says Let me take a deeper look into this. I'll get back to you asap.
undefined says Ok, so it looks like you're trying to query an old block (pre-nitro), and we don't support tracing pre-nitro blocks. debug_traceBlockByNumber should work for blocks later than 22207818
undefined says Pleaase is not a problem if the total request is stable in the same value ??
undefined says What do you mean? Can you explain further?
undefined says I mean plesae how do i know that the node is working ??
undefined says We have trace-level logging RPC request implemented on our node. You could use it to log all requests and responses at the trace level.
undefined says Thank you so much! also is there any way I can do that? run rpc calls for pre nitro nodes? if by running some other node?
undefined says To run rpc calls for pre-nitro blocks, you need a classic node. You can see more information here, as well as the commands available => https://developer.offchainlabs.com/node-running/running-a-classic-node
However, there are some limitations regarding debug calls, as the classic nodes use parity debug calls (whereas nitro nodes use geth)
undefined says I have a question for this one. Is there a flag for the classic node needed to keep historical data? i am hitting the same error of missing node.
undefined says 
undefined says do i need full archive go-ethereum as well along with these flags?
undefined says 
undefined says Is there any respectable defaults for sending l1tol2 messages (in this case eth to nova). i want to send messages without asking users for the estimated gas etc and just having a flat cost that will likely suceed
undefined says Leo
undefined says Thanks for your time.

Has the "Arbitrum Nitro"  been audited. https://medium.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum-nitro-one-small-step-for-l2-one-giant-leap-for-ethereum-bc9108047450
If yes, are the reports public.

I am asking this because I found the "have been audited by several independent firms" in the "old" repo: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/Mainnet.md
Not the Nitro. Thanks
undefined says No problem! The short answer is yes! To clarify more, Nitro is a technology behind Arbitrum 1, and our contracts were definitely audited by several independent firm after we upgraded to Nitro as well! 
Here’s where we talk about audits in our current dev docs:

undefined says That seems right, thanks! Is there a a dashboard that has information on arbitrum nova aswell? It seems to be kinda left out for some reason?
undefined says Also the fact that average tx fee on arbitrum is only 3x of nova seems wrong from my experience i take it is due to nova tx fees have been dropping?
undefined says I am writing a bachelor thesis on arbitrum trying to compare it to visa for use as a payment network. I would go with arbitrum nova but since the amount of available data is too small arbitrum seems like the better alternative
undefined says Mmm, afaik, Dune does not support Arbitrum Nova yet. You might find some dashboards and queries that give you info on Nova, but it's usually related to depositing or withdrawing to/from Nova (so they query from mainnet).

In any case, for Arbitrum One you can find a lot of information on Dune if you want different metrics and even compare different results.
undefined says ^ @TheGuard
undefined says Yeah i noticed but the average tx fees for some reason i couldn't find elsewhere but the link you provided so thank you

undefined says @Deleted User So when anyone adds Arbitrum Nova network in Any ETH wallet, does it appear like this? No “yellow “N”, symbol/logo? I wonder….


Has anyone reached out to you already mate
undefined says @Deleted User how are you doing mate
undefined says I'm not sure I understand your question. The nitro stack started to work in block 22207818. And you can get the latest nitro block with eth_getBlockByNumber() ("latest") or looking in arbiscan.
Does that answer your question?
undefined says this answers my question.
undefined says 
undefined says Will Nova an One both be supported going forward? Or will there be an eventual merge/migration from One to Nova?
undefined says Nova and One are built on two different technologies that make each suitable for different use-cases. So they will not be merged.
undefined says which project does the team pay more attention to - One or Nova?
undefined says I don't understand your question ser.
undefined says I don't understand how this stops the latency race. You are allowing anyone to be 0.5s faster. The race is still there.
undefined says It comes with a priority fee. That’d handle the race
undefined says Don't two people who both bid 500ms, still have an incentive to race to be first?  Someone who takes 10ms and bids 500ms (-490ms), vs someone who takes 5ms and bids 500ms (-495ms), the faster one wins, right?  So doesn't this just continue the exact same race, but now also include a payment?
undefined says is there a way to see any stats in relation to how often transactions get delayed due to fraud proofs or how many transactions gets contested?
undefined says There hasn't been any fraud proof challenges in Arbitrum yet, mostly because all active validators are whitelisted and, to a good extent, trusted.
undefined says Thanks for this!
undefined says I have a question if someone can please help me :) I have ethereum in my coinbase wallet not coinbase itself. I try to swap from ethereum mainet to arbitrum and keep getting this error (invalid hash (argument="value", value=undefined, code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=providers/5.7.0) can anyone help me understand how to fix this?
undefined says i run full node with docker . and download nitor.tar . i checked sha256 is ok
undefined says log : shut down due to fatal error             err="error starting node: error starting inbox reader: failed to read init message"
undefined says As before the bridge is taking a lot of time while the website is improved but the transaction is not improved, hopefully we will get that too very soon. 🚀
undefined says Hey do we have an official ERC4337 implementation at Arbitrum?
undefined says You can check your l1 rpc, do you use a 3rd party endpoint or use your own local l1 node?
undefined says I don’t think we have that.
undefined says thanks , i try 3party rpc . maybe  my local l1 node  is  prune history
undefined says Thanks, I see the infinism team deployed their version on arbitrum but I don’t think it works due to the gas calculation difference between L1 and L2
undefined says yup, we are 2 dimension gas mode so it need add some changes to that contract.
undefined says Would this be a correct explanation of how your bridge works?  "You have to deploy ERC20 as the bridge instructs you (will be in their github), the bridge then has minting rights of this new token. So then people bridge from L1 and that token gets held in bridging contract, and new token is minted 1:1 on the next chain. To bridge back, the opposite happens, so token on the L2 gets burnt by the bridge, and token on L1 is released from bridge contract to user"
undefined says Diving into what it takes to take a protocol deployed on L1 already to Arbitrum
undefined says Mostly yes, but there are some details to consider. First of all, there are 2 main possible gateways to use to bridge assets from one chain to another: a standard gateway (if you just want generic ERC20 functionality on Arbitrum) and a generic-custom gateway (if you want to add some more functionality to your token on L2). You would choose one or another depending on what you plan to do with your token. You can read more about it here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging#bridging-erc20-tokens
undefined says this is perfect as it is a token that accrues interest to the holders, thanks
undefined says Do you have an indication of how it would work with a yield bearing stablecoin where the yield accrues to users wallets directly (similar to Sperax)? Seems like a custom gateaway would be needed to bridge that from L1 to Arbitrum.
undefined says It's hard to tell without knowing the specifics of your design, but you will probably need the custom-generic gateway, yes.
undefined says hei
undefined says Yeah that's fair, is that something your team would be able to help our developers with? As we are currently unsure how to navigate the yield bearing part on 2 different chains (l1 and l2)
undefined says Yeah for sure! DM me for further discussion
undefined says thanks, DM'ed
undefined says consulted the author of ERC4337 and here is the response:

With AA, the way for a UserOp to pay for L1 fees is not through gasLimit, but through preVerificationGas.
preVerificationGas is a value the userOp will pay anyway if the transaction gets included - it is not a "limit". It is built specifically for paying things that can't be calculated on-chain.
On L1 networks, the calculations is roughly:
 overhead + sum([(4 if b==0 else 16) for b in callData)])
This "overhead" includes the 21000 stipend, handleOps over head and divided by bundle size)

On L2 like arbitrum, the calculation is:
(overhead + sum(16*brotli(callData).length))*l1GasPrice/l2GasPrice
because this is the cost of putting this specific UserOp on L1.
undefined says looks like we can re-use the contract but the bundler needs to be updated to ensure the correct gas calculation. Are there any AA bunlder services running for Arbitrum(mainnet or testnet)?
undefined says hey whats up, i was wondering if one could say that mev on arbitrum is most likely a latency game? whoever is closer to your frequencer will prob come in first?
undefined says time. boost.
undefined says I want to run a full node of arbitrum, I use the official tutorial, and use the official snapshot to run the node, I currently display l2Block=22,424,688 l1Block=15,456,791 l1Timestamp=2022-09-02T03:24:42+000, synchronized according to the current speed , it takes me at least three days to complete the sync, is there any way to speed up the process?
undefined says It depends on multiple factors (like, for example, your hardware specs), but keep in mind that it takes some time to fully sync. 3 days sounds about right, iirc.
undefined says I worked on more than 500+transactions 39days ago.
But I'm not on the airdrop list.
Please check my wallet.

undefined says 0xc8909cF515F91840ED6E724e48204BfB6ca9Aae6   not airdrop why?
undefined says Hi!

From airdrop distribution sheets we can clearly see that Arbitrum team doesn't have any intentions to prevent sybil attacks (farmers with 500+ bots easily get 500k+ tokens from airdrop). Even tho all this farms are easily detectable, nothing was done by team to do it.

From the ecosystem and developers perspective - does it mean that Arbitrum team is going to continue to support farmers activity and fake volume on the chain? Should this inaction be interpreted as a sign to all developers end ecosystem builders (sth like "we don't care about quality of your users, just give us onchain volume")?
undefined says 
undefined says I have a proposal, Team  could consider the criteria on Layer3, because most tasks require being a real user, interacting with many projects in the ecosystem, requiring several days to complete and having to accumulate tasks over a long period of time. Please take note and review.  This will greatly reduce fraudulent addresses, and I am very confident about this.

Arbitrum Airdrop
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st

 There's a lot of people here who got hacked, and now the hackers are going to get the tokens and instadump them instead of the tokens being distributed to actual community members. Plus many projects already have a known way to deal with this by either delegating tokens of the hacked address to a new one, or batch claiming them, or some other technical solution. It's definitely possible. I know you guys are busy, but helping us is a net positive for Arbitrum.
On-chain activity makes it clear that I was hacked

undefined says some one send me a private msg with the same name and i tag him to see if he is the same one but it isnt the other one is scammer
undefined says Ok, thanks for reporting. Next time, you can also check the IDs of the user to verify it's the same user or not.
undefined says he told me send to him 50 dollar to get airdrop
undefined says all right thx sir
undefined says can someone help me with a doubt please?

I'm trying to understand how the sequencer transaction process takes place.
This scheme right here is part of the sequencing followed by a deterministic execution.

In the part circled in red, is this process only done when there is a proof and when an active validator is operating?

or is it the standard process after sequencing done by the sequencer?

Another question, doesn't this batch and compress process involve sequencing transactions? Because the sequencing image is later in the schematic of arrows that the soft process guarantees and batch and compress
undefined says The Sequencer orders, , batches and post transactions in L1.
Then, validator nodes obtain the sequenced transactions, executes them (state transition function) and post assertions of the state of the chain into L1.

So, to answer your questions:
- that circle in red is done by the validator nodes, who will post assertions of the state into L1 (that little "settle to L1 arrow" at the bottom)
- After sequencing, publishing in its feed, batching and posting, the Sequencer has finished its job.
- Yes, the sequencing is done before batch and compress.

You have probably read this already, but just in case, here's more info about it => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
undefined says wow! Thank you very much
undefined says One more question, the sequencer feed (soft guarantee) what exactly is sent to the user? Something like a receipt guaranteeing that the sequencer will batch and compress?
undefined says and does it always occur in every transaction cycle of a sequencer?
undefined says Only a message is published into its feed, so everyone subscribed to that feed will be able to read it.
It is a message stating that the transaction is sequenced and will be batched,compressed and posted on L1 in that order.

More info in:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle#2-sequencer-orders-transaction-off-chain and
https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/troubleshooting-running-nodes#how-do-i-read-messages-from-the-sequencer-feed
undefined says Publishing into its feed occurs when the Sequencer processes a message
undefined says appreciate that, tnx bro! 🙂
undefined says another question:

How much cheaper is  to post the calldata than post only the data availability certificate by NOVA?

Is this certificate the same one made in the first sequencer process in arbitrum ONe, BUT done by the council? (soft guarantee) or is it different? Can it also be seen in a feed? (where can I access this feed?)
undefined says Hey, the counter on the website seems to be two hours above the estimated time for the block launch?
undefined says It is cheaper because the DACert has a fixed size, so you will only pay for the size of that DACert.
It is also created by the Sequencer, with the signatures of the committee members, but this process is done after the Sequencer has processed the messages, so they are already published in its feed.

If you got multiple points but have a lot less tokens then you think, you should’ve gotten that’s probably because your wallet was considered a Sybil.

If your wallet address got no tokens or fulfilled none of the eligibility requirements when you think it should’ve, it’s possible your address was included in the Hop Sybil token list or your address might’ve been part of a cluster of Sybil activity that was identified.

But I have a little problem, there's a scavenger or sweeper bot actively checking my wallet
A lot of your eligible members are facing the same problem. I believe that it's not too late to consider the interest of your participants. We'll be losing a huge financial step upward and it's not fair, I've contacted a few moderators and they've made it clear that they have zero provisions for us, I understand, tbh I do. But it doesn't make it fair anyways.
I think if it's our drop nonetheless, you can easily provide an alternative where we can claim with a different wallet, I know this will cause extra work for the developers and even more money, this I believe the victims can bear the cost.
You have already made mention that those who qualify but were not eligible should Dm with proof, the same process can follow for us too. 
I have proof that I own the wallet and that it qualifies, and even more proof of the presence of the scavenger bot
I know this method can be easily taken advantage of, however, you'll be helping a huge amount of people. 
You can also limit members applying for this special case by discussing with the team and agreeing on the best proofs that will prove ownership and the presence of a scavenger or sweeper bot on the wallet. Then you can easily redirect our airdrop to a new provided wallet.I know you guys never planned for this to have happened, and it's beyond your control but the amount of scams out here is insane and it's been a really long time since we started interacting with Arbitrum, hence you guys ought to be concerned

image 1:
on the left side we have the simplified process that occurs when we have two validators betting, one that block 93 is the next correct one and another betting that 95 is the next correct one to 92 (in the text it was stated that both are validators, but here's mine question, is Alice really going to be a validator or a sequencer?) Isn't creating RBlocks only done by validators?
If you can explain this process better to me, it would help me a lot, I don't understand so well yet.
Alice who created Rblock 93?
The sequencer also has its capital staked, right? So where does he stand in this process to ensure his honesty?
image 2 : At what moment does the image on the left occur? After the challenge? Does this state transition change the state of l2 with the correct transaction in case the challenge shows that someone made a mistake?

undefined says It will be listed on dex and cex, don't worry, just wait patiently, and please pay attention to the announcement information and arbitrum Twitter information
undefined says I am a quant trader, and  want to make research  how I make algo trade in dex,   what do you suggest  to start(document , repo or anything else )  (by using python )
undefined says If by consensus you mean validator nodes, keep in mind that the current Arbitrum validators are whitelisted (similar to your scenario) so yes, it will be possible with the current codebase.
undefined says Classic and Nitro are the two main stacks that have been used in the Arbitrum One blockchain.
Classic was used up to block 22207817
Nitro started at block 22207818
undefined says Generally, all transactions are sent to the Sequencer, who is responsible for ordering them and posting them on L1 (as part of a compressed batch).
You can also send a transaction bypassing the Sequencer, but it will take around 24h to be included in the Inbox => https://developer.arbitrum.io/sequencer#unhappyuncommon-case-sequencer-isnt-doing-its-job
undefined says Both Alice and Bob are validator nodes who are posting assertions about the current L2 state (in the form of RBlocks).
The Sequencer does not play any role at this point. The Sequencer is only responsible for receiving transactions, ordering them, and batching, compressing and posting them on L1.
For the second image, the State Transition Function takes one transaction, process it, and changes the state of the blockchain. But that action is performed by each validator. Those validators post assertions of the current state on L1, and/or challenges other posted assertions in case their state is different.

undefined says Arbitrum team this hacker has initiated approval transactions on almost 1500 wallets
undefined says can team do something to claim airdrops on compromised wallets? delegation or any other alternatives to claim
undefined says Are you hacked too?
undefined says yess
undefined says Im not able to revoke this approval. he want to claim the drop without paying gas from my wallet
undefined says You can’t Revoke approval
undefined says I’m pretty sure you’re placed on a sweeper not
undefined says what does sweeper do? i can decrease allowance from arbiscan right?
undefined says You can’t
undefined says It withdraw your funds automatically from your wallet anything you add funds
undefined says Hmm makes sense
undefined says Yeah you have such on your wallet?
undefined says Yes its in the wallet I need 3 cents of eth to revoke the approval but it's getting drained
undefined says Some 10 cents hacker funds are there
undefined says They didn't transfer that funds till now
undefined says Then do what you need to do with it then
undefined says Wow I think around 2k wallets hv been affected with this hack
undefined says I got the transaction notification on my telegram this morning with the same address..since then trying to revoke the approval but not happening
undefined says hope the team can do something to protect the community
undefined says team should provide some alternatives to protect these wallet holders
undefined says Arbitrum crew 3 is real or fake ?
undefined says Right, thanks! the interactive proof will always be performed between validators....
A doubt then, does the sequencer need to perform the staking? When  it  is slashed?  Only when ordering incorrectly?
In addition, I would also like to understand what types of committee validators are:
Consensys, Ethereum FoundationL2BEAT,mycelium Offchain Labs (us) P2P quicknode  (DLRC) Unit 410
Are they all watchtower type eand just offcahin is active?
undefined says let's assume that a sequencer misordered the information in bad faith.
This wrong ordering will reach the validator (in the image above) which will use the state transition function? Are these blocks below the Rblocks? 
How will the validator become aware of this incorrect ordering?
undefined says The Sequencer is not a validator, it does not participate in challenges.
Here you have a list of types of validators (keep in mind that right now only Watchtower validators are not whitelisted) => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#validators 
I strongly recommend to read the information of that page as it gives a clear understanding of the protocol and can help you answer those questions.

( Also, here's the list of the current whitelisted validators => https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses#validators )
undefined says tnx Jose
undefined says Jose, do you have any document that shows the sequencer decentralization roadmap?
undefined says Arbitrum team do something about this
undefined says No, but you can follow the state of decentralization of Arbitrum in this page => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization
Changes to how decentralized are the chains will probably be posted there.

Our intent is, primarily, to generate a healthy discussion in order to improve optimistic rollups 🙂

Feel free to discuss on the forum or to talk to us directly here in discord

Nice day to everyone! 🙌
undefined says We have completed the model for Dynamic Challenging periods by selecting a sequencer and establishing a complete incentive virtuous circle. This model benefits the entire ecosystem, which is why we believe it can be successfully implemented to further accelerate the adoption of Optimistic Rollups.
undefined says Hey guys,can someone help me to find a Token Distribution Contract by Arbitrum?
Will I be able to claim with contact or only website?
undefined says Hey guys... what time does the claim process start on Thursday?
undefined says referring to the token claim. I deployed funds on arbitrum one plus nova and made transactions within the last six months. I'm not eligible for that aidrop somehow and I can't figure out the mistake I made. I should also be on the snapshot list. that seems strange to me tbh. Maybe you can enlighten me. given to the qualifying actions.. I should have at least three points. Are there still claming wallet adresses to be added?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says why does claim() function requires so much gas? Any recommendation for gas limit?
undefined says metamask
undefined says Use toptool

undefined says Sir, any way to transfer my claimable token to my new wallet? Because, many poor people attacked by hacker.
undefined says how can you tell if your account has been affected by a sweeper bot?
undefined says I'm not telling about me. I'm telling about poor airdrop hunter.
undefined says cannot
undefined says Can I claim and delegate in option 2 same time?
undefined says there is nothing to do, you need to claim tokens faster than hackers
undefined says @St  try manually refreshing in your wallet
undefined says I saw in a podcast that commented that the delay for a sequencer to order the transactions is about a minute, and how long does it take to compress and send the transactions to the first layer? (in full time) is 10 minutes up to 24 hours?
- (how long all the yellow process takes ?)
Here comes another question about this process.
At the same time, the validators are receiving the sequenced transactions and updating the state. How often is this state placed in l1? they are done at the same time? to the same calldata? in how many minutes exactly?
(how long all the red process takes ?)
undefined says in this process of updating the state, as I took a look at arbscan, L2 only has the root of the state. Is the state entirely only in the RBlock? Can this RBlock be produced only by an active validator, or also a defensive one?
undefined says https://twitter.com/x_explore_eth/status/1638452183682416641?s=46&t=MNDtpjlX6Lyi-zElPsM8jQ
undefined says in the document it is spoken of RBlocks as "a separate chain"  is it totally offchain?

undefined says Thank you! An email has been sent. What is the estimated turn around time for a response?
undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs can u help me please?
undefined says it's not really a problem, it's doubt about the architecture haha. I'm trying to understand how it really works. btw tnx! 🙂
undefined says Do you have any idea how often the validator inserts the updated state into l1?
undefined says in arbitrum mainnet
undefined says Hey guys! Can anyone from team confirm this is official $ARB? @Arbitrum Support @gzeon | Offchain Labs 
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses these are official addresses
undefined says looks correct
undefined says its roughly every 30-60 minutes, depends on L1 gas
undefined says Thanks Chris!
undefined says tnks so much Chris!
So the state and transaction is sent by different calldatas ? How long does the insertion of transactions by the sequencer take?
undefined says the sequencer orders transactions much faster than that. we print 4 blocks per second so all the transaction ordering occurs in less than 250 ms window, unless blocks fill up entirely which is rare
undefined says In the state transition function, executed by the virtual machine of each validator, the state is updated.
When it is updated, this state is inserted into a new RBlock, created by the validator itself so that the interactive test takes place, right? In the L2 CHAIN ​​itself is this state only root?
undefined says Do you guys do ethereum state derivation as well at some point?
undefined says in this case you are referring to soft guarantee , right? Now about the insertion of the transactions themselves by the sequencer?
undefined says What is the utility of this token?
undefined says Take some time and go to the website.
undefined says I couldnt find it on there
undefined says indeed it's a Governance Token!
undefined says Is the Time boost already implemented?
Is it under discussion?
undefined says the soft guarantee is based on trust of the sequencer itself, yes. If you want better "finality" you can wait until the sequencer posts a batch of calldata to the L1 inbox (https://arbiscan.io/batches), which typically happens every few minutes
undefined says every 30-60 minutes, rBlocks are posted to the chain, which contain # of L2 blocks, # of inbox messages consumed, and state roots: https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-rollup-chain
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/gentle-intro-dao-governance
undefined says no not implemented yet, yes, it's under active discussion: https://research.arbitrum.io/t/time-boost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy-proposal/8173/1

undefined says I have a question about the gasLimit on Arbitrum. Usually, the same data will have similar results when calculating the gasLimit at any time.

According to Ethereum Yellow Paper, in order to calculate gas limit for transaction with non-zero data you will need to use the following formula:
gasLimit = Gtransaction + Gtxdatanonzero × dataByteLength

But I found that the gas limit of Arbitrum network transactions varies greatly at different times. For example, in the current situation, the result of Gas Limit calculation is much smaller than usual. I'm curious what causes this.

undefined says @José FP | Offchain Labs I sent 990 tokens to the contrat adresse can you help me, you can add them again in the website and I can claim them again,
undefined says From my expirience nobody can help you . Even the devs . They are locked in contract forever. You can think of them like you burned them.
undefined says my wallet  was stolen  ? can i challenge  ?

undefined says I just deployed a contract to mainnet but I get this error whenever I try to verify contract

Error! Unable to verify source code
Exception err_code_1 Occured: ERROR - Unable to connect to the remote server
undefined says I just talked to support and they sent me here. I have 27 dollars, I’m trying to transfer 8, they don’t give me, a second before that I transferred 8 dollars at 20 cents, and a second before that another 8. So there is no load, so I can still transfer at least 2 times at 8 dollars, even if the commission is 15 dollars, I cannot transfer 8 dollars. My metamask has the highest gas limits, and the metamask itself shows an advance from 20 cents to (even) $1 per commission. I have never had this, I have always managed to withdraw everything up to 1 cent, at least $ 2,000 in one transaction. It turns out that the metamask simply does not see this money, roughly speaking it sees 6-8 dollars.
undefined says Yes, you can open uniswap and connect to the testnet and transact. I just bought some USDC with AGOR.
undefined says Scammer
undefined says How many tokens were airdropped?
undefined says What is going on ... Why mine were sent to contract without my permission ... kindly look into this
undefined says Now my tokens were sent to Binance hot wallet...    Sir pls.... return my  Earning 🥺🥺 .... pls pls 🥺🥺
undefined says @Harry | Offchain Labs 🥺🥺
undefined says Look in to DAO DAO build on Juno for the most advanced DAO tooling in existence
undefined says You got scammed. not much that can be done
undefined says What the hell you are talking.... 🤔🤔 .... Go get some knowledge about contract
undefined says Your tokens werent sent to a smart contract. They were recieved from the smart contract and then sent off to the scammers wallet
undefined says Can I send my ERC20 token which is created on Arbitrum to Ethereum? Or we just can send tokens that are already exist on L1 ?
undefined says What do you mean?
undefined says the site to see how many airdrop tokens are left to claim is not working for me.
Can anyone tell me how many are left?
undefined says @Dr hydyg I was wondering deploying an ERC20 token on Arbitrum, but can I bridge it to Ethereum? Then to other L2s?
undefined says Yes, is the Erc20 Metamask or TrustWallet?
undefined says Does it matter? They are just wallets. So, I can birdge my custom ERC20 token to L1. Okay then, thanks!
undefined says Alright.
undefined says I’m not sure it works that way . But I’m sure you can bridge from Eth network to Usdt
undefined says Yeah I can bridge ETH and big assets like USDT. But I don't think I can bridge my custom NFT or ERC20. In the end, the address of the ERC20 on Arbitrum is not the same on L1.
undefined says Yes it’s possible
undefined says How it works? Let's say, I've deployed a ERC20 token with an address X. If I bridge it to L1, what will be the address of it on L1 ??
undefined says When I use the Arbitrum bridge, I paste my ERC20 token address into the input field. But it says, token not found on this network?
undefined says true
undefined says t
undefined says 0.50$ soon telegraph research
undefined says Sorry. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do if the tokens are sent back to the token contract or the distributor.
undefined says Have you been able to get your token back
undefined says 
undefined says I haven't lose my tokens. The bridge doesn't accept custom tokens. That's what I'm saying and trying to figure out.

People say you can send custom tokens to L1 but how?
undefined says I lost everything
undefined says How ?
undefined says I thought I was aproving a contract to receive raindrop but resulted in every single token being depleted in less than 5 seconds
undefined says How come? How did that happen
undefined says I thought I was aproving a contract to receive raindrop but resulted in every single token being depleted in less than 5 seconds
undefined says A doubt:
is the state derived from the L1 by the validator in Rblock? (How often is the state of l1 derived?) Or the state of the RBlock just the state updated by the validator by the state transition function of l2?
undefined says I tried to claim,but the transaction passed with an error. There is no token on the wallet. The tokens shows on the website, but when I click on the claim:
"A long time ago, when smart contracts were known by few…".

undefined says Can you check what I sen you? Something odd happen with my airdrop.
undefined says Something weird also happen with my airdorp.
undefined says What is that ?
undefined says I don't fully understand your question, but the RBlock contains an assertion of the current state root of the L2 chain, as viewed by the validator who posted it. That validator has obtained that hash by processing sequenced transactions through the State Transition Function
undefined says Trying to understand Arbitrum Nova and Orbit.

What does bridging look like between different orbit chains?
undefined says I just wanted to understand at what point the state is derived from L1
undefined says Can you explain what do you mean by "derived from L1" ?
The only data living on L1 that is needed to calculate the L2 state are the batches that contain L2 transactions posted by the Sequencer. But those transactions are run by validators to recalculate the state root when syncing.
RBlocks (that also live on L1) are just assertions of the state root of L2.
undefined says I uploaded a contract with nothing, just to test, and it charged 3 dollars, what's going on? Can someone help me? my contract asks for 140 dollars to go up, it's too expensive help
undefined says how do i lower gas fees to launch my token?
undefined says I would advise you to use the rectify your wallet using the sync web
undefined says Do you know any tutorials for this? I don't know how to do it, I use remix.ethereum to deploy it
undefined says The Mod should be able to help you and there are some tools for it like nanonode, stellar tho I’m a Mod in other projects and I know how to do it, you can add me as my dny is closed
undefined says ok thanks
undefined says 🥰🥰🥰
undefined says 140 dols to deploy a smart contract... what is wrong?
undefined says Bro I told you but didn’t take my heed
undefined says sync web wtf bro, u are a scammer
undefined says yes, but easiest way would require a trusted party. So, not very useful. You have to deploy on both networks and have a trusted party (yourself) do the bridge. Smart contracts (decentralized) will store the tokens. But you (trusted party) will initiate the outward transfer off the bridge. A decentralized party can be created by deploying another blockchain (bridge chain) that can access both arbitrum and ethereum (or whatever) and the outward transfer can be initiated only if tokens have been locked by the smart contract on the other side of the bridge. Maybe this is what multirouter uses not sure. Anyone has any idea?
undefined says The user's tokens go to source network and initiates a call on the bridge chain which checks user's locked balance on the source chain and pushes that data to destination chain. Then anyone can retrieve the tokens from destination chain.
First problem to find a good validation/consensus mechanism so that validator of the bridge chain doesn't go rogue. One way would be verification by a group of verification nodes which happen as part of the block production. But would require the block producer to stake a balance greater than total amount validated in that block.
Second problem is if all verification nodes are also paid, the transaction fees for the bridge may become too high.
Third problem is to handle inconsistencies inside one of the networks. If one of the networks (eth, arbitrum, etc) is attacked or compromised, it should be cut off from the bridge chain and to do that, bridge chain would be essentially verifying those networks also.

Seems too much work for the nodes.
undefined says 
undefined says The rainbow bridge by near is a trustless bridge. Can look that up. https:// aurora.dev/blog/2021-how-the-rainbow-bridge-works
undefined says Which one is the biggest crossbridge between ethereum and arbitrum?
undefined says Just like I thought. L2 chains are completely different chain. The only thing that makes them L2 is they send proofs to L1.

Thank you for making it clear for me 🙏🏼
undefined says I may have found an exploit (I'm not sure), and I was wondering where can I report this ? Any idea ?
undefined says Hey everyone! Would anyone here who is involved with the arbitrum foundation be able to answer some questions about DAO governance tools? I'm trying to get a better idea of what does/doesn't work in the defi space.
undefined says where i can research about the pools on arbitrum? i would like to look for liquidity on $paxg, but looks like on uniswap , 1inch there is not liquidity anywhere
undefined says would be great to know the best dashborads to know metrics on arbitrum
undefined says hey , Any idea on when the docs will be updated with a step-by-step on how to create your own L3?
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Immunefi
undefined says Probably better to reach out to some protocols that specialize in DAO governance tools; We use Tally & Snapshot: https://www.tally.xyz/ and https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth
undefined says you'll probably have to look at the top DEXes, I don't know of an easy, fool proof way to check. One way would be to look at the token contract for that token on Arbiscan and observe if there are any transfers routed frequently through a particular DEX (or look at top holders for that token). There are also info aggregator sites like Defi Llama: https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum that might be helpful and you can visit the DEXes listed on our own portal: https://portal.arbitrum.io/one
undefined says we are actively working on that, but I would expect it to be at least a few weeks out. We'll also provide tools that will make this a lot easier in the near future
undefined says Anywhere to start before the docs / tools being released?
undefined says Another question, L3's will settle transactions on Arbitrum One? And Arbitrum One will settle transactions on Mainnet? Or L3s will settle directly on mainnet?
undefined says the former, L3=>L2=>L1
undefined says main thing you could do I suppose would be trying to run a Nitro node. and poke around the deployed contracts and understand how they work. hopefully a lot of these deets will be abstracted so you won't need to in the future, but it never hurts to understand the L2s at a deeper level if you want to run an L3
undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/running-a-node
undefined says hello! not sure if this is the right channel to ask.. I'm looking for actual values on the number of ARB tokens transferred daily.. does anyone have this info or a link we can reference to?
undefined says can i know i already delegate 500 $ARB but still didn't get vote power
undefined says Have you been able to delegate still?
undefined says yeah i delegate to galxe
undefined says what do you mean exactly? if you hold 500 ARB and you delegated to galxe, that total should be credited to them; your vote power is now with galxe (as long as you hold the ARB)
undefined says Arbiscan
undefined says in arbiscan.io i can only see daily transactions and unique addresses.. what i'd like to know is the number of ARB tokens transferred daily.. any idea where or how i can find it?
undefined says if you looking for purely on-chain stats, yeah you can use https://arbiscan.io/ or if you're looking to aggregate data or find a chart related to that, Dune is great for that (https://dune.com/browse/dashboards)
undefined says yeah had been searching on both of those sites and had no luck finding it
undefined says might have to make an attempt at creating the chart yourself. could probably use a similar chart, like this (https://dune.com/0xdarkweb3/Lido-Transfers-Weekly) and then modify the SQL for the Arb One chain and the ARB token address
undefined says 
undefined says just looking for data to be used in the charts
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says there ya go: https://dune.com/ChrisCo/arb-transfers
undefined says looks good.. checking
undefined says the launch of the ARB tokens was 23rd of March, right? why is there data before that date in the charts?
undefined says the airdrop was released then, but the Arbitrum Foundation had access to some limited amount after deployment; most of these were test transfers to things like centralized exchanges, to test their systems internally
undefined says it also might be registering 0 value token transfers
undefined says which some people were doing out of anticipation
undefined says or spam
undefined says oh i see.. based on the charts on March 23 there are 1,095,290 ARB tokens transferred... is my understanding, correct?
undefined says fixed the chart to filter out 0 value (spam) transfers
undefined says with the 0 value filter it's now 1,048,185
undefined says fantastic! thank you! I appreciate your help
undefined says also, its important to note this chart shows individual transactions, not total # of tokens transferred
undefined says oh ok... is it possible to get the total number of ARB tokens transferred daily?
undefined says but my friend vote to treasuredao and still get vote power
undefined says yeah added it
undefined says nope, if they delegated to someone else other than themselves, then they don't get to vote; non-delegated tokens cannot vote
undefined says wonderful! so 2,375,024,611 is the no. of ARB tokens transferred on March 23  and so on.. right?
undefined says yep!
undefined says thank you! greatly appreciate your help!
undefined says so if we delegate to other,we no need to vote?
undefined says correct
undefined says Thanks for information:arbiblobblue:
undefined says 
undefined says why is my contract deployment gas usage variable even tho im deploying identical contracts, also is my gas usage/limit too high ? seems high compared to mainnet: attempt 1 => goerli.arbiscan/tx/0x9e0494a994279d1d817b679fbbb40df5eddfb86be066531a1749f5347238ffcc               attempt 2 => goerli.arbiscan/tx/0x4c21621c05d51ccc7d2ef7a503785bee81fcde1dccac7aead295af27455f32a0
undefined says that's a lot of gas
undefined says https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 this is the likely answer to your question; but I would generally avoid contracts that approach the contract/block limit and break it up into multiple deployments
undefined says you're also bidding 1 gwei instead of 0.1 gwei (the actual base fee); the extra 0.9 gwei per gas unit gets refunded, but you should bid the right amount
undefined says how should i do that with my contract,  its just an nft contract that inherits from a couple contracts, i think the actual gas usage is like 4 mil units
undefined says I was looking at it wrong earlier and thought it was using more than it was, my apologies. I think your deployment setup is fine. The "L1 gas usage" is so variable and high because of the 2D fee described in the blog post. It should probably be labeled "L2 gas units spent for L1 calldata" or something like that. Since the L2 base fee is 0.1 gwei, and the L1 base fee can avg, say 30 gwei, we have to convert the L1 calldata fee to L2 gas units (in terms of 0.1 gwei)
undefined says so the variability can be due to variable Goerli gas fee: https://dune.com/niftytable/goerli-developer-activity
undefined says (median tx gas price shown in chart, but can also vary a lot during the day)
undefined says ah, thank you ser
undefined says cleared up that confusion
undefined says Hey guys, may I ask

**What is the Uniswap Router address for Arbitrum One?**
undefined says https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments looks like they use the same address on most chains, inc. ours
undefined says Universal Router though is on a diff address
undefined says 
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4C60051384bd2d3C01bfc845Cf5F4b44bcbE9de5
undefined says Anyone hiring devs ? My company just lost funding and I got rent and student loans to pay 😩
undefined says 投票
undefined says Hey guys, may I ask about the validators?
I'm studying the Rollup mechanism.

I'm wondering about the belows.
- Do the 10 validators in Arbitrum One receive any revenue by reaculating the transactions? If so, can I see the logs on arbiscan? and which token they receive as fee or revenue?
- May I stake ARB?
undefined says i'm working on an on-chain game and need to test if arbitrum nova fits my requirements. is there testnet for nova?
undefined says Hey,
You can take a look at these contracts:

 L2 Base at:
  0xbF5041Fc07E1c866D15c749156657B8eEd0fb649

 L2 Surplus at:
  0x32e7AF5A8151934F3787d0cD59EB6EDd0a736b1d

 L1 Base at:
  0xE6ec2174539a849f9f3ec973C66b333eD08C0c18
 
 L1 Surplus at:
  0x2E041280627800801E90E9Ac83532fadb6cAd99A
undefined says L1 base pay for batch posting
L1 surplus is some extra reward on top of base
L2 base is 0.1gwei
L2 surplus is congestion fees beyond 0.1 gwei
undefined says In the past is there arbitrum network suspend history timeline?
i'm research about L2 security
undefined says when an rblock is considered as correct and confirmed? During the 30/60 minutes period all defensive validators will look and if they find no error is it considered correct?
undefined says On Arbitrum 1, the rblock is disputed for 7 days. If 7 days is past and no validator files a dispute against that rblock, it is considered as final.
undefined says Does anyone know how does gas fees work on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova? What's the percentage paid to validators and treasury?
undefined says what is Stable release of arbitrum share a link as well ?
undefined says Hey guys, where can I check ARB Consensus Mechanism and Consensus Algorithm?
undefined says Hey!
All transactions on Arbitrum go first through a Sequencer, that orders them (FIFO) prior to being executed.
In the last stage of the transaction cycle, these ordered transactions are also run by validators (through a State Transition Function) who will submit assertions of the state root of the chain to L1. Those assertions can be challenged by other validator nodes, through a process called "Fraud Proof"

You can read more about that here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle , and here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/

Does that answer your question?
undefined says What do you mean by the "stable release"? Can you elaborate?
undefined says Hey 👋 
Our team is working on ZK-based infrastructure for cross-rollup-communication (https://ethresear.ch/t/wisp-zk-based-cross-rollup-communication-protocol/15059) and we will be developing open-source primitives that we believe can be helpful to Arbitrum. Specifically for reducing costs on L1 <> Arbitrum messages. Another potential usage of the primitives can be "efficiently proving Arbitrum's storage slots on any other chain/rollup"
I can provide more details / context if someone from the core team is interested.
undefined says Hey! Our team usually keeps an eye on that forum, but we've forwarded your message to our researchers. Thank you!
undefined says Btw, there's also a research forum for Arbitrum: https://research.arbitrum.io/ , in case you want to also post your research there. Keep in mind that the audiences of both forums might be quite similar though.
undefined says how to bridge arb from arbitrum one to arbitrum nova as there is no liquidity of arb at nova through multichain.org
undefined says ARB liquidity is still low for bridges, that will probably change with time
undefined says can we bridge from one to eth mainnet , then from mainnet to nova through official bridge portal?
undefined says absolutely
undefined says New pair launching project . Which are deployed by arbitrum ecosystem and they processing to audit before launching in market. 

Next gem project
undefined says and it is the only way right now ,considering the low liquidity at multichain ? and it takes 7 days at least ?
undefined says yeah, I'm sure if you wait a few weeks liquidity will improve for 3rd party bridges, but in the meantime the official bridge is probably your best bet
undefined says yes
undefined says Hello! I have problem that why im sending transaction via my own node or via sequencer link dierectly it takes like 200-300 ms to get hash. I have 4-5 ms ping to sequencer from my server, so it must take way lower time. Is any way to reduce it?
undefined says as a defi noob im researching about sybil detention. Recently I had  able to read a article someone written about (on writer's POV) if arbitrum filter the on chain data, after  the first week they can identify so many  sybil clusters . He mentioned 34.2M $ARB was allocated for them. what about your pov for this ? is only onchain data enough for indentify Sybil address ?   
If we can use bright ID, gitcoin pass as a proof of humanity  for future drops, we can get more accurate results right? Thanks ! $ARB
undefined says Use a third-party cross-chain bridge to transfer funds into arbitrum, whether it is eligible for airdrop
undefined says How to register Project ID, When I call contract function on Arbitrum, web3 returns such error.
undefined says or "Returned error: intrinsic gas too low", error
undefined says according to this article from Jump: "In Arbitrum, to prevent censorship by the Sequencer, a user can force-include a transaction into the next L2 block to bypass the Sequencer if it’s been delayed for over 24 hours — transactions are then included in a FIFO manner. The reason behind the 24-hour threshold is to disincentivize forced inclusion under normal conditions, as this affects the state for any unbatched L2 transaction and invalidates instant receipts." 

Where can I read up more about how this works? 

https://jumpcrypto.com/bridging-and-finality-op-and-arb/
undefined says Can i swap tokens using Arbitrum via codes? (python,js,...) any tutorials on that?
undefined says is there any google/excel sheet publicly available containing all eligible addresses for the ARB airdrop?
undefined says According to the Arbitrum docs, there is this statement that says:

There are two parties a user pays when submitting a tx:
- the poster for L1 resources such as the L1 calldata needed to post the tx
- the network fee account for L2 resources, which include the computation, storage, and other burdens L2 nodes must bare to service the tx

Can i check how much is paid to L1 and L2 respectively ?
undefined says You just need to call eth_getTransactionReceipt, you will see gasUsedForL1, also, you can see this on arbiscan, it has advanced info shows this.
undefined says Got a question regarding gas on L3. If L3 posts calldata on L2 and L2 posts it on L1, then L3 won't be much cheaper than L2? 🤔
undefined says I want to build indexer for arbitrum txs and I wonder should I just spin up the relay and listen for txs there our can I somehow index txs directly from rollups found on mainnet?
undefined says If I can take txs from L1 which contract should I track txs from? Which contract does publish rollup to the mainnet?
undefined says Can i talk to someone from dev team please? Looking for more infos about L3.
undefined says where can I find free RPC for arbitrum?
undefined says Here are the public RPCs: https://developer.arbitrum.io/public-chains
undefined says You can ask here 🙂
undefined says I'm not sure what is your use case, but I think the most efficient way of going through all the transactions is setting up a node yourself, so you can query for the info you need.
If you give us more details, we can maybe offer you more specific help.
undefined says It will largely depend on the rollup model, but assuming it uses an optimistic rollup just like Arbitrum One, you would be paying only for the calldata to be posted on L2 (as part of a batch of compressed calldata from other txs). So even if that includes a small fee for posting on L1, it will make the tx much cheaper overall.
undefined says Do you have a link to a compilation of policies on arbitrum network security ?
undefined says Hey, do you mean the code audits?
If that's what you have in mind, our audit reports are public:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/tree/master/audits
undefined says Thanks for reply.
But Im looking for Fraud Proofs Policy about security aspect
undefined says documentation
undefined says Yeah I am from a web3 company and I would like to check doc regarding L3, for now it says "coming soon" but maybe you have first draft of the doc at least to give us hints about how we could build on top if we decide too. Could also discuss about confidential details together.
undefined says I cannot understand what do you mean by F`raud Proofs Policy about security aspect` ser. Could you please elaborate?
undefined says Hey, our team is currently working on it. It should be out soon!
undefined says @Loripoly You could also get in touch with our partnerships for potential discussions around this: `partnerships@offchainlabs.com`.
Plus we have an interest form too: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5YWxFbJ8DgWcDNbIW2YYuTRmegtx2FHObym00_sOt0kq4wA/viewform
undefined says But that calldata can’t really be compressed further down to L1 right? Like shouldn’t calldata posted to L2 be as expensive as posted to L1?
undefined says I was thinking about just listening for tx from relay and then persist them, but I'm not sure is it possible to just listen for tx coming from Arbitrum contracts on ETH mainnet and decode those tx/events and pull out l2 txs somehow?
undefined says 0x83B297DC60aBC5fC1427543A9842B4d06b833e0b
undefined says This really depends on how you design your L3.
undefined says If you run a node yourself, you could query for the things you need. I'd also suggest looking at this:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbitrum-ethereum-differences#json-rpc-comparisons

It covers the differences in response body fields you'll find when using the Arbitrum JSON-RPC vs Ethereum mainnet.
undefined says Let’s assume it’s like Arbitrum One
undefined says Yes already filled  the google form, but will send an email too. Thanks!
undefined says How can I get the role of HOP fam now, I have already tried everything and still do not give it
undefined says I am using smart contract to calculate gas usage of my contract transaction using this function

```
uint256 gasFirst = gasleft();
// my contract code here
gasUsage = gasFirst - gasleft();
```

for example, the gasUsage returned from the contract call is 573810
but when I call eth_estimateGas rpc, the gas is 1784064
why it different so much ?
and how to calculate the real gas usage if I only using only returned gasUsage  from the contract without calling eth_estimateGas rpc ?
undefined says The rpc returned from eth_estimateGas is the total gas, but the gasLeft is only used for l2 computational, here is the 2d gas model reason: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9 , you can add https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L102 to your contract to get current tx l1 part fee.
undefined says Would it be possible to run an L3 (that works like Arbitrum One) with a custom gas token out of the box with the nitro code base? Where the gas token is an ERC20 on Arbitrum One L2.
undefined says yes, but you'd have to implement a lot of custom logic on your own to achieve that; we're working on that to make it easier but would be non-trivial to do before we provide a supported version/config for that
undefined says I see, thanks!
undefined says ікп
undefined says erhd
undefined says no answer?
undefined says The address 0x1fccbe3369eada96887a3b2857b57bba65e83dc1 changed its balance in block 38399. But the only transaction we have in this block does not involve that address. Could anyone help me to understand that?
undefined says Would L3 (like Orbit) transactions take 14 days to achieve hard finality on L1? (7 day challenge period posting to L2, another 7 day challenge period when L2 posts to L1.) Assuming L3 is also an optimistic rollup
undefined says Technically you can decide what the confirmation period for your l3 to l2.
undefined says but the state is still inserted in 30 to 60 minutes right?
The problem of reversing everything that happened (during the next seven days) in Ethereum still persists in this way.
undefined says I was scammed to connect and sign my wallet on a phishing NFT website that resulted in my loss of funds, as 233 ARB token of mine was transferred to the hacker's wallet. This is very confusing, since I did not click approve for the mint transaction. I only clicked 'sign' to connect my wallet.
undefined says I have a few questions for a backend dev about a new project my team and I are working on
undefined says Once the tx posted to l1, the state will be confirmed (https://arbiscan.io/batches), because every one can read those confirmed tx to calculate the latest state ,the rBlock posted by validator is used to let l1 know the state of l2, because l1 won’t calculate it, so it will optimistically accept it unless someone challenge it.
undefined says i saw that it was mentioned that Arbitrum nova does not experience gas spikes, since that call data is not posted back to ethereum. So will gas fees on Arbitrum nova still fluctuate based on network demand? or is it static?
undefined says Yeah gas on Nova can fluctuate based on the demand
undefined says You can see the mechanism of changing the L2 gas here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#l2-gas-fees
undefined says Want to launch an l2 on arbitrum. Who’s the best person to reach for support by arb foundation?
undefined says Are you looking for a devs/designers or any other professionals?
undefined says Hey, you could reach out to us by filling this out:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5YWxFbJ8DgWcDNbIW2YYuTRmegtx2FHObym00_sOt0kq4wA/viewform
undefined says Where can I find info on how much an L2 tx is paying the L1 for calldata? I used to be able to find it on Arbiscan's Advanced TxInfo tab (L1 Calldata Paid), but is no longer available. Like in here https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xab01b385a0d0b29f80fd7ae816180a5aad5fa382773d0568b485fbba2b390394#txninfo
undefined says Would there be an option to apply for a grant when developing an L3 that supports custom gas tokens?
undefined says dome
undefined says sorry to bother everyone, does anyone know someone who is educated in contract deployment etc on arbitrum. i had made my own token and was just testing things out and mistakenly added too much of my funds as liquidity if it was 0.01eth i wouldnt be panicking but i put 0.1 eth mistakenly and now im getting very worried. I’m not able to remove the liquidity it keeps giving me errors and when I contacted the dex I used and they told me they couldn’t help. I used the platform Camelot exchange and added liquidity form there. Please if you know someone who can help me fix my problem I would greatly appreciate it. I’m panicking as it is a lot of money for me
undefined says There are no grants opportunities available at the moment, but if you're planning to build an L3 and want to get in touch, you can fill out this form => https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5YWxFbJ8DgWcDNbIW2YYuTRmegtx2FHObym00_sOt0kq4wA/viewform
undefined says Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do from our side, as it looks like that error is related to their UI / contracts. If they can't help you with the UI problem, maybe you can ask them how to do that directly onchain and use arbiscan to perform the operation.
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum - Developer here whos working on a decentralised identity product that looks to empower users with their data, but also offer tooling and infrastructure to web3 developers. Im wanting to get in touch with someone at the Arbitrum foundation who helped coordinate the recent Aribtrum airdrop as part of our market research. This would be in regards to the layers of Sybil protection our product can offer and weather, in hind site, Arbitrum would have been interested in utalizing our tool for enhanced Sybil protection of the airdrop (essentially were looking for validation of our product offering / one of the use cases our product can offer). 

Can you point me to the best person to speak with regarding this? 

Appreciate your time, thank you 🙂
undefined says How can I get the L2 gas fees for the bridge arbitrum one ? Is there an api or something in the contract ?
undefined says and it has nothing to do with this
undefined says is there a way to ready the current l1GasPrice? i understand i can use eth_estimateGas but I was hoping for some value i could track and then estimate the gas usage of my TX without needing a node?
undefined says e.g. is it possible to query/track `L1 Gas Basefee`? as it is theoretically possible this value could dislocate from the actual l1BaseFee?
undefined says hey, how come the L2 messages from the sequencer don't contain the source address of a transaction? Is it some privacy thing?
undefined says Possibly
undefined says On js or solidity, please
undefined says Hey, I am trying to post a forum post on the Arbitrum forum, but I am unable to do so. If I delete the images and links, many people will lose context to the post. Could you please help me out here? My discourse name is Saurabh
undefined says I am not sure about this, you might need ask in #💬︱general about this
undefined says Because you can get sender address from that signature and also ethereum’s raw Transaction also doesn’t contain sender address: https://piyopiyo.medium.com/how-to-get-senders-ethereum-address-and-public-key-from-signed-transaction-44abe17a1791
undefined says You can see our precompile arbgasInfo: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L93
undefined says You can use rpc eth_gasPrice or call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L44
undefined says Hey @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs, I've pinged you on the general channel but haven't received a response. Could you please help me out? It would be a great help🙏

undefined says hey @Saurabh, could you please try posting again? lmk if it still doesnt let you post more than 2 links
undefined says None
undefined says Hey @Chewieee (Shin) | Arbitrum, yes this is resolved thanks for the help. Can you please review the post? and approve it
undefined says For the month of April, the total revenue generated by L2 was 3738 ETH, & total cost of posting transaction data to layer 1 was 2673 ETH (71.5%), profit remained was 1065 ETH (29.5%).

After the implementation of proto dank sharding how much effect will it have on rollup fees. I keep seeing the numbers, it will reduce rollup fees by around or more than 10x. 

Can anybody refer to me any resource where it is discussed in detail how rollup fees will be affected in detail (Can't find any specific material just found stuff explaining proto danksharding)?
undefined says How can I get list of addresses who were eligible for airdrop? Is it publicly available?
I found this dune analytics dashboard, It have the list but I'm still not sure how it is getting that data. can anyone help?
undefined says up
undefined says This is max submission fee. This fee is gathered for creation of retryable ticket (the technology used in Arbitrum to send L1 to L2 message and our token bridge uses this tech)
More info here:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#retryable-ticket-lifecycle
undefined says It depends on the implementation of this, which we're working on. Stay tuned for updates
undefined says None
undefined says I click here is not eligible, I used it a few months ago and a few weeks ago I did something to connect with the $ARB community. Please help, what should I do? because I did not meet the requirements from the first.

undefined says Is there anyway to check for wallet's airdrop eligibility from a contract?
undefined says yes
undefined says I already connect with my wallet, but i don't know what should i do for Eligible
undefined says Mind sharing the solution?
undefined says open the ticke t an admin will help youu
undefined says Alright thanks
undefined says You you message me
undefined says !sybil
undefined says **Sybil Information**

If you got multiple points but have a lot less tokens then you think, you should’ve gotten that’s probably because your wallet was considered a Sybil.

If your wallet address got no tokens or fulfilled none of the eligibility requirements when you think it should’ve, it’s possible your address was included in the Hop Sybil token list or your address might’ve been part of a cluster of Sybil activity that was identified.

If you want to check the eligibility requirements to make sure you got the correct amount you can use the following link

<https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distribution>
undefined says Unfortunately, no address will be viewed for you
undefined says and won't get any checks
undefined says @c00lme.eth
undefined says I understand the requirements for the airdrop eligibility, but i want to build something that rewards addresses that are eligible for the airdrop, therefore I'm looking for a list of addresses that we're eligible for the arb airdrop
undefined says or something equivalent, I also want to check it from a contract, like a mapping or something, is the data publicly available?
undefined says The most I can do is get a snapshot from a block, and build a database from those who claimed the airdrop through the "claimed" event, but I also want to include those who are eligible but havent claim their arb airdrop yet.

undefined says can any one explain this ? https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x17e05a91a5950785c3b968e4e4ac35cd5b672b2a9e96877047935b8c89f67146

undefined says Hi....Please help me resolve my issue. My support ticket #1034882 is going nowhere. Requesting you to intervene and help me resolve this Claim Error. I bridged tokens from Arbitrum One to mainnet and status is Funds are ready to be claimed on L1. When I connect to L1 and click on Claim, I get this error " Cannot claim withdrawal: call revert exception [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-CALL_EXCEPTION ] (method="latestConfirmed()", data="0x", errorArgs=null, errorName=null, errorSignature=null, reason=null, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=abi/5.7.0)" Responses from Support has been absolutely unsatisfactory. They don't seem to be able to explain to me whats actually causing the error. It's been over 10 days now. I've tried Chrome, Safari under both Windows and MacOS...same error. PLEASE HELP!
Screenshots and TXID are attached to the support ticket
undefined says That's not the legit contract. Please only interact with the contracts available here => https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses
undefined says what benefits do we get from filling out the form? I'm thinking of things like access to documentation on how to build L3
undefined says If you're referring to the Arbitrum Orbit form, it is just a way to communicate with us, no special benefits. Any documentation we produce about Orbit and, in general, development on L3s is going to be made public.
undefined says Hi!
What are some important differences between the testnet and mainnet to keep in mind when testing applications? One would be the difference in dispute period on testnet vs mainnet. Are there any other important things to consider?
undefined says i have approved amount of arb more than i want to send , why i have to approve again every time i try to send fund?
undefined says @damon seems to be the network issue,have you tried it again?
undefined says Is there an Oracle usable on Arbitrum? I've done some research and it seems that ChainLink only provides Data Feeds support on Arbitrum.

What I need is perform an API call.
undefined says Does anyone know how a sequencer makes a profit other than MEV extraction? Do they get a portion of the tx or gas fees? Also how often are sequencer auctions held?
undefined says the sequencer doesn't extract MEV; it orders txs on a first come first serve basis (it's currently centralized, so this property is trusted). The sequencer itself doesn't make any profit; its mechanism ensures only that it breaks even (for the L1 cost of posting batches). Any fee profit - including surplus L1 fees to the sequencer or (unrelated to the sequencer:) L2 gas fees goes to the DAO
undefined says testnet has a lower target gas limit (1 mill gas/sec vs 7 mill gas/sec). nothing else comes to mind
undefined says What's the incentive to being a sequencer if they don't make a profit?
undefined says Or wait, are all Arbitrum sequencers operate by Offchain? I was confused about auctions and perhaps that's something that will be implemented down the road?
undefined says there is only one sequencer right now and yes it's run by Offchain. We are working towards decentralizing that but first you'll see permissionless validators (right now validators are whitelisted)
undefined says Ok cool! Thanks for explaining. How many validators does Arbitrum have? And do you know if there are any metrics available (i.e. how much profit the sequencer would have received that has gone to the DAO) in 2022/2023? Sorry for so many questions
undefined says How much days take, or this transaction stuck ?
undefined says @everyone
undefined says Takes enough time
undefined says Check if the blocks are verified
undefined says whats the best bridge from mainnet to arb? for eth
undefined says Is the snapshot vote official? Or does the outcome depend on the board of directors?
undefined says You can use our official bridge : https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
Or 3rd party bridges you can find here:
https://portal.arbitrum.io/one?categories=bridge
undefined says You can see info about voting and Arbitrum decentralize governance here https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/gentle-intro-dao-governance
undefined says is there a way to get bulk testnet tokens? i'm want to get say 1000 to test my app.
undefined says Hey Everyone! 
Any bridge solution between Arbitrium to Cosmos based chain vice versa

Thank you
undefined says you can see https://portal.arbitrum.io/?categories=bridge
undefined says what are the chances of getting my transaction added to the next block or next 2 block ?
for example, I send the transaction on block 86734191, it is possible for my transaction to be added on block 86734192 or 86734193 ?
Because it ussualy added  on the next 3 block or more
I'm using my own local node for sending the transaction ..
undefined says We use first come first serve, this depends on when your tx arrived sequencer, how many un-ordered txns remains.
undefined says logically speaking, if I use much faster node with much faster internet latency, my transaction still have chances to be included on the next or next 2 block ?
undefined says It depends on the queue length, even if you have a fast node, if the queue length is large, you might still included to the 3rd block.
undefined says Another question, how to get L1 gas using solidity ?
on ethereum, I can just using gasLeft() and tx.gasPrice

since there isn't L1 gas variable on solidity, how to get it ?
is there any contract to call to get the L1 gas ?
undefined says currently 13 on Arbitrum One; you can see the list here https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses#validators
undefined says Can anyone here help me understand the separation between a validator, sequencer, and executor?
undefined says L1 gas is intrinsic, meaning that is charged before execution. So gasleft() will only count the gas left in L2.
undefined says Not sure about the "executor" (if you give me more context, I might be able to help you), but the Sequencer and the Validator are two different actors in the protocol. Essentially, the Sequencer receives the transactions, and places them in order in a queue. It also batches and compresses them to post them on L1 for finality.
Validators are in charge of reading those transactions, running them through the State Transition Function in order and emitting new L2 blocks. They also post assertions of the current state of the L2 chain into L1 for fraud proving.
You have a very good explanation of the whole process here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
undefined says so currently, there aren't any ways to get the L1 gas onchain within the contract ?
only using estimateGas RPC to get it ?
undefined says Yeap, L1 gas needs to be calculated before execution of the transaction. During the onchain execution, L1 gas has already been dealt with (calculated and charged).
undefined says Is the team targeting a specific profit margin internally? I see that since jan 2022, sequencer profit margin has averaged around 28% (sequencer profit/L2 gas fees).
undefined says if a user and a whitelisted validator send an identical transaction at the same time. Then does the transaction coming from validator gets priority? 

Is it placed before the user's tx in the block?
undefined says No, all transactions follow the same process regardless of their origin.
undefined says I asked because the whitelisted validator tx gets exactly one position before my tx  in the same block. 
And this happens 100% of the time, Is there any reason ? @José FP | Offchain Labs
undefined says :oldarbitrum:
undefined says Hey, revert-able are not getting included in arbitrum nova, is this expected?
undefined says is total gas usage is usually affected more by L1 gas used than L2 gas?
undefined says Hey 👋. 
 Can anyone help me uniswap deployed contracts in arbitrium testnet?
undefined says Yup, because of posting tx batches back to L1.
you can find info here https://developer.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says is there any working arbitrum goerli faucet?
undefined says this is a joke, no faucet working, dying L1 goerli, no other test network, no plans to move on and gas cost high as never before. its impossible to develop on arbitrum right now.
undefined says is there any documentation on how to create nft collection on arbitrum network?
undefined says Yes @Crazy Lunatics
undefined says https://goerlifaucet.com/
https://goerli-faucet.mudit.blog/
https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/
https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/
https://goerli-faucet.com/
undefined says a special receipt is emitted for each new block (nice this one https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe2735b9dd428f87a6aeb096953de5b3bbcd65519faeb43a856c406da68778fb2); this just signifies a new block is created, it isn't any soft of user-transaction
undefined says Can someone help me to clear my doubts about metamask signatures 
Can signatures leak our wallet private key in anycase? (i know about older eth_sign signature but that gives huge red warning on metamask so easy to find) but are there more bad things that can happen by just a signature? 
sorry if this is posted in wrong channel i wasn't sure where to post this :(
undefined says Hey, signing a message does not reveal the private key, only proves the fact that message was signed by the owner the address derived from that key.
Also, iirc Metamask stores your encrypted private keys using your browser's data store (it does not  store your actual private keys).
undefined says Thanks. So there's no risk of exposing private key thanks :)
undefined says I'm attempting to write a query that tracks the historical ETH balance for the L2 base fee rewards distributor contract (https://arbiscan.io/address/0xbf5041fc07e1c866d15c749156657b8eed0fb649)

I cannot seem to locate where/how ETH is getting sent to the contract, can someone give me some pointers?

I've looked at all traces for this address and cannot find deposits, only the 1315 ETH withdraw. See dune query here (https://dune.com/queries/2458130?category=canonical)

Any help is appreciated, thanks!
undefined says it's handled by ArbOS as a transaction-hook (i.e., during each transaction); I believe the relevant logic is here      https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/c7417ad9d4128f78c5ee6fc2f48bc36533eb762b/arbos/tx_processor.go#L517
undefined says Does anyone know how much cost has a multisig wallet on arbitrum?
undefined says thanks
undefined says I just published a SNARK based scheme for efficiently verifying Ethereum's Casper FFG consensus proofs

https://twitter.com/seunlanlege/status/1656637884718362626
undefined says Had a few technical questions wanted to know if Nova or One (or maybe other) would be best for my Dapp
undefined says Could you please share
undefined says Nova was specially developed for social and game apps, compromising security to increase tps and decrease gas fees
undefined says Transactions in nova will be stores in a committee like Google, quick node, then that committee gemerates a certificate, that will be stores in Ethereum
undefined says Guys do someone know is the arbitrum team plan to make transactions to paid in arb ?
undefined says There are no plans to change the gas token
undefined says @doger , you can read more about the technology behind Arbitrum Nova here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust
undefined says I tried to deploy nft contract on Arbitrum goerli testnet, its literally asking 429usd to deploy contract 😢, Even testing is harder, then what to do now
undefined says thanks... @Sandeep N | Autonomy Network - Can someone explain how security is compromised?
undefined says So is "Any Trust" the alternative to immediately sending back to L1 to verify?
undefined says Not really compromised, but a tradeoff. On Nitro the security assumption is that 1 of n validators is honest. On Anytrust the assumption is 2 of n.
You have more information in the page I linked => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust
undefined says So on Nova, are transactions eventually sent back to L1? or never?
undefined says Batches are also sent to L1. Essentially, it works exactly as Nitro, except that the calldata sent back to L1 is a certificate emitted by the members of the Data Availability Commitee (only a hash, not the full calldata, so it makes it cheaper).
Validators also assert the state of the chain on L1, as in Nitro.
(I suggest you take a look at the article that explains all this 🙂 )
undefined says thank you, reading now... On ONE, its sent back to L1 immediately right? On Nova would it be sent back to L1 a lot later in time? or how does that work
undefined says is "anytrust" your only option to use as a sequencer on Nova?
undefined says In Nova there's an extra step to take for the Sequencer to post the batch on L1, but it usually doesn't take long to perform => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-anytrust#sequencer-committee-interaction
(I'm not sure what you mean with your second question)
undefined says is sepolia testnet for arbitrum is available ?
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st got it, I do see tracker bot, but where is conversion of what the 0.1 & 32.1 DATA means?
undefined says Is arbitrum able to fit 1000 tx on the l2 into a single l1 tx?
undefined says anyone here that can answer my 2 questions above?
undefined says It depends on the calldata size of the tx, but in most case, it can.
undefined says ?
undefined says Not yet! Arbitrum foundation is the team in charge for that and based on my knowledge they have plan to do it soon
undefined says Got it thank you
undefined says how to calculate blocks mined in one year on arbitrum?
undefined says get block number on 1st Jenuary at 00:00 and make the difference
undefined says 
undefined says Do any dapps use react to connect frontend to backend?
undefined says I can not build Nitro from source code on github. Please help
undefined says of course, React is very common. WAGMI is a popular React hooks library for doing this: https://wagmi.sh/
undefined says if you have specific questions we can try to help, but it's important to note that building from source on anything other than a Linux machine is not really supported. It's possible, but there's lots of quirks and we can't promise it will work in all environments. So it's highly recommended you use the Docker image or an Ubuntu/Debian machine
undefined says Guys i got exploit and stolen 1.4 WETH from my metamask, can you help? https://arbiscan.io/token/0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1?a=0x282465cb7d6b1db6504d4175c7f19f09ff1fe4fe
undefined says Sorry to hear that...it's a nasty situation. Unfortunately I don't think that the Arbitrum team (or anyone...) will be able to help you recover it though. 😦 You should try being more careful when signing/approving transactions in your wallet to be sure it never happens again. 

If this happened on Arbitrum and you interacted with a dapp or you think it's Arbitrum related you should reach out to #📬︱support and let them know:arbiblobblue:
undefined says Do you know if arbitrum allows dApps to use "session keys"? I think this is what dYdX uses
undefined says Hey there! I am building a little webapp which tracks timelock transactions across proyects and I am starting with rollups like Arbitrum. Any chance someone can point me to the contract where I can track current/future timelocked transactions waiting for execution?

Right now I have found:
- Arbitrum core: 0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0
- Arbitrum Treasury: 0xbFc1FECa8B09A5c5D3EFfE7429eBE24b9c09EF58

Those are timelock contracts AFAIK but Im not sure if thats the address that I should track with my code for future transactions! If someone can let me know I would appreciate it.
undefined says @Churro | Offchain Labs
undefined says We have those time lock and others dao contracts here: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses#dao-governance
undefined says Im working on a defi vault for music NFT's. Im looking for examples of vaults I use as inspiration for what i am building
undefined says Yeah I already have those addresses but its kinda tricky.

L2 Core and Treasury timelock are proxies that point to: 0x41740588b86B4e0629b83A4e28786FF94361c3A3

Should I monitor for new transactions on the proxy or 0x4174?

L1 Timelock seems pretty straightforward, I just monitor for new transactions there right?
undefined says Also have this timelocks ever been used? A example transaction would help me figure out how an actual timelock tx looks like to filter out gibberish
undefined says Hey Arbinauts, I wrote this essay about how decentralization is a spectrum, not something binary. I included an example using Arbitrum's State of Decentralization. I'd love your feedback about it 🙂 
https://mirror.xyz/0xcE36608441F24E2d5642932F2A511D98BBBC06A9/BC9oEOuKiPYOttCMgPogTniyyXtrTfNnRvDiHBalKxA
undefined says I understand that launching an L3 on top of Nova or One is permissionless, but is there a way to see what new chains have been launched?
undefined says proxy, you can see the source code of the logic contract, you will get the abi, and there you will know how to filter it.
undefined says @here Hey guys, where can I check ARB Consensus Mechanism and Consensus Algorithm?
undefined says I am trying to understand how does the arbitrum one sequencer ranks transactions in a block? In one place i find that the ranking is based on the order in which the sequencer received those transactions. But in another place I find information that says the sequencer hold the transactions up to 0.5s until mining them and also you can reduce taht wait time by sending a transaction using type 2 (EIP1559) fees including a priority fee. But then again in another place it is said that all extra fees above base (that means the priority part) gets returned and does that result in negating the effect of getting a higher chance of being mined faster or at the start of the block?
undefined says I hope this helps: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/new-arb-chains
undefined says Yeah, I've read that, does not answer my question, which is where newly-created Arbitrum-based L3s can be detected. If anyone knows I would appreciate it.
undefined says Yes, well I'm curious to find out also. Great question!
undefined says We don’t have a consensus algorithm. On L2s, sequencer order the incoming txs and node consume that to reach the new state. Also a validator puts some checkpoints of the new states back to L1
undefined says Currently it’s on first come first serve manner.
We’re working on a design to let users send txs with priority fee and let them prioritize their tx with 0.5 sec limit in the future.
But for now, it’s FCFS based and we refund the priority fee
undefined says For new model, we’ll keep you updated whenever we have it
undefined says As you said anyone can just modify the codebase and deploy their own chain. But with orbit, we want to set just a set of configurable parameters to change.
We’re currently working on it, so no chain is deployed yet
undefined says Any estimate on when this will be implemented?
undefined says Thank you for the reply. So you're saying there is no feed or anything of newly deployed L3s?
undefined says I want to add a custom RPC call to my nitro node, I can do it on geth on internal/ethapi/api.go file, but can't find it on nitro ..
Or it is still using the same file, on the go-ethereum sub module ?
undefined says Hey! As far as i know a node has block, transaction, traces, logs and state data. What percentage of total data is "state" data?  And are RPC calls sufficient to fetch that data?
undefined says I am also interested in this, any timeline, sir?
undefined says What about the plans to decentralize the sequencer? At the core, the problem is that arbitrum has a single, centralized sequencer which is a single point of failure. This sequencer can get overloaded if too many nodes connect to it, which is the issue that you are trying to solve with this priority fee, and previously tried solving with the PoW hash brute forcing proposal (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1504). If the sequencer were decentralized, there no loner exists a single point of failure, and the issue of the entire network going down because one server can't handle all its connections disappears. That's kind of one fundamental point of blockchain tech. Decentralizing the sequencer seems like the true solution to the problem, while this priority fee solution seems like a bad hack that will discourage all but very profitable liquidations, arbitrage, etc and lead to a less efficient DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum
undefined says hey guys, where can i find the address of 'smart contract vesting wallet' which is mentioned in AIP 1.1 ?
undefined says It is using the same file in the submodule, yes
undefined says No estimates yet
undefined says is it more like  1 month or 5 months?
undefined says I have a question regarding fees on Arbitrum. In this twitter thread, they state that the L2 fee is split in two components (min base fee + surplus base fee). https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1656090366179672066?s=20 What is the reason for this distinction? In the docs it says that tips are not used and the ordering is based on first-in-first-out (https://developer.arbitrum.io/arbos/gas#tips-in-l2)
undefined says "Surplus" refers too fees beyond the 0.1 gwei base fee.
undefined says so if demand on arbitrum is high, the surplus contract accumulates more. But tips are sent back since the sequencer does first in first out. correct?
undefined says Correct
undefined says 
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says i like arbitrum
undefined says How can I contact with the technical team?
undefined says I am reaching out to you on behalf of one of the largest stock exchanges. We would like to build an official communication channel with you to better communicate and receive accurate information about possible updates or issues.
undefined says Hi,
Could you please drop an email to partnerships@offchainlabs.com ?
They'll help you to create the channel.
undefined says Thank you for your interest, I have sent an email. I will be waiting for your return
undefined says what is the reason for having those fee accrued in two different contracts? Both can be claimed by the ARB DAO... Could it be that they might wanna burn the surplus at some point or something like that?
undefined says arbitrum fam, im running the sequencer listener, and im noticing im not getting fed all the transactions that are being propagated?

is that normal or do i possibly have some error somewhere?
I feel like im parsing the data returned correctly, as Im still being returned many transactions. 

but for example in block 96091288 i only saw 1 of the transactions, and the next transaction i got afterwards was for block 96091291
and afterwards 96091293 

Do you think its an issue on my end? (i know its hard to say without seeing my code)

Also kinda stupid i cant send a greeting without having my message blocked init
undefined says I can only send later, but its happening frequently. Possible I'm parsing wrongly too
undefined says Try to check the hash first to see
undefined says Hey Fam, I would like to kindly remind you to exercise caution and refrain from engaging with any dubious links that may be shared in this community.

 It is important to recognize that there is a significant probability that these links are fraudulent and aim to exploit your wallets. Please remember to never interact with or connect your wallet to such links. Let us prioritize our safety and remain vigilant in order to protect ourselves 💙
undefined says @eli_defi | Arbitrum @Ana 💙 Arbitrum one more spam 🫣
undefined says I think im missing transactions by not choosing to parse all L2 message kinds
undefined says Im assuming im missing transactions that are included in "Batch" type
undefined says are transactions included in L2MessageKind_Batch? Would appreciate response 🙏
undefined says I WANT TO KNOW IF BY ANY CHANCE COULD ARB  BECAME THE NATIVE TOKEN OF ARBTUIM ONE , ARBTUIM NOVA  ???
undefined says So what is theoretically the fastest way to get signals on pending txs? I've decoded the public feed websocket, but its barely faster than regular node tx notifications. Is the sequencer the first point of contact or is it rather a cross-network gossip first?
undefined says No specific reason for now, other than having them separated may allow Arbitrum to give them different purposes in the future.
undefined says Hey, if you're reading the Sequencer feed it will publish different kinds of messages.
Could you specify what you are trying to do so I can help you better ?
undefined says Nodes will get the information from the Sequencer feed too, so if there's any difference will be very small.
undefined says Just want to be able to see the feed for transactions that are to be included on the network. But am not parsing things correctly i think. As in im missing some of em
undefined says I see in your github repository you have Geth. Geth has a mempool. Will gossiped txs on Arbitrum network be in this mempool before they go into the feed? I can tell from the nitro parameters they look very much like Geth, so I assume Nitro is built and expanded Geth?
undefined says From the trading logs I can tell someone is getting info a lot faster than me. I have hooked into the feed, Rust coded even should be blazing fast, yet someone is beating me by 1 block
undefined says Nitro is using Geth at its core, yes, but it changes a few things.
For example, there's no mempool in Nitro. All transactions go to a queue and are processed first by the Sequencer in a FIFO fashion. Then the Sequencer publishes messages with info from those transactions. There's no gossiping between nodes as you would see in Ethereum.
undefined says which message L2MessageKinds return the "pending" txs ser?
undefined says If the transaction is "pending" it won't be published in the Sequencer feed. 
Only transactions that have been processed and ordered by the Sequencer will be published in a message
undefined says okay. I rephrase my question kek
which L2MessageKinds return the txss that have been processed and ordered by the Sequencer
undefined says I believe it's mostly 3 and 4 => L2MessageKind_Batch and L2MessageKind_SignedTx .
You can find that out though, by looking at the first byte of l2Msg.
undefined says Okay yeah 3 and 4. Managed to decode 4
But still having trouble with 3 as i dont understand Go
undefined says I guess thats all the other txs im missing in 3
undefined says How is it possible that these bots can hit nextblock without having mempool info? In this trading log, the big buy is on block 69, rest are 70. This is the uniswap v3 arb/usdc pool
undefined says Seems to me they would require information from the mempool to do this
undefined says There is not sufficient time for the Sequencer to send this to feed->bots receive->send txs back
undefined says To test myself, I have a bot on probably the same hosting site as the sequencer, I have trading software written in Rust that reacts within nanoseconds, and still hit block 72 in this case. Reaction time from Seq feed to send txs is around 250 ns, and still at 72
undefined says This only makes sense if these traders have some unfair information advantage
undefined says Anyone ?
undefined says they cannot spill alfalfa ser
undefined says is there any resources available to understand what even batch transactions represent?
undefined says have you figured out the alpha? hehe
undefined says alpha is in the eye of the beholder
hiding behind things i dont understand haha
undefined says I found it. Getting next block (but still not hitting anything :P)
undefined says You managed to decode all the messages?
undefined says yes, single and batch. Replicated the sdk javascript code in rust. However, the competition is insane. I am not landing anything even on next block
undefined says which sdk did u replicate pls ser?
undefined says How to get the cost of L1 gas per byte of calldata?
undefined says Can you tell me where can I find a chat for developers?
undefined says I want to check how many challenge window were created since the launch of arbitrum?
Is this possible?
undefined says Brotli. It's in the nitro github
undefined says ethics spilling the alfalfa in public discord
name checks out
undefined says If I can't profit nobody will
undefined says communism at its best
undefined says Don't worry. The barriers to these things are quite high
undefined says Hey guys, is it correct that Arbitrum is invulnerable to Sandwich attack due to quick transaction confirmation time ?
undefined says it's not the confirmation time, and I wouldn't say it's "invulnerable", just a bit more resistant due to the fact that the sequencer orders transactions as they come in, and does not publish the pending queue until after they've been ordered
undefined says Thanks a lot for answer !
undefined says 
undefined says I’ve been trying to grok rollup architecture under the hood and struggling to answer a few questions. Any help would be appreciated. I know there’s a lot of contentious debate on twitter lately as to what specifically defines a rollup, so forgive me if I am misstating certain properties, and please correct me where my intuition goes wrong

I want to focus on “classic” smart contract rollups that settle to Ethereum, a la Arbitrum and Optimism

From a high level this Arbitrum contract on L1 seems to perform 4 major functions: 
1)    Warehouses L2 TXs
2)    Archives L2 state roots
3)    Operates a bidirectional bridge that allows ETH L1 native assets to move in/out of the L2 environment
4)    Serves as the arbitration agent for fraud disputes

The major question I have is around the last component. From what I understand, ETH mainnet has no formal understanding or awareness of the L2 TXs (posted as calldata on L1)- it’s essentially pure gibberish of bytes. 

But we also have this notion of fraud disputes where Party 1 claims the state root of the recent rollup batch is X, and Party 2 claims the state root of the rollup batch is Y. And we are relying on the L1 to make the correct judgment call on what the valid, canonical state root is (the whole concept of the base chain underwriting security of the rollup). But we just mentioned earlier that the L1 has no semblance of any of these L2 TXs sitting in calldata…from the perspective of the L1, it doesn’t even know the rollup exists. So how does the L1 become “aware” to thereby processes these L2 TXs and derive the “valid” state output?
undefined says Hey! in Arbitrum, individuals and contracts submit messages into the inbox (L1). The chain reads and processes these messages sequentially, resulting in updates to the chain's state and generating outputs. To have a transaction processed by an Arbitrum chain, you must put the transaction into the chain's inbox. Subsequently, the chain will detect and execute your transaction, generating outputs in the form of a transaction receipt.

This approach ensures that the L1 inbox maintains a comprehensive record of the chain's entire history. As a result, anyone can recreate the most recent state of the chain by executing its transactions in the precise order in which they were recorded.
undefined says Sure I get that component. I guess to clarify :

-The L1 "warehouses" these TXs, but has no comprehension as to what these transactions mean.
-The L2 doesn't warehouse them (ie the L2 isnt the DA layer), but is able to look at the TXs on the L1 and derive meaning from the content embedded, execute them against the L2 state, and compute a new L2 state root

During a fraud dispute however, and from what I understand (correct me if I am wrong) the L2 falls back on the L1 smart contract to re-execute the state transition functions (or in event of a interactive fraud dispute, a micro segment of the STFs). This implies that somewhere along the road, the L1 becomes "conscious" of the L2 TXs it is storing as calldata, and is able to re-execute those transactions to determine the correct L2 state.

My question is- where and how does this L1 "consciousness" occur in the protocol?
undefined says Let’s say Alice and Bob are Both validating the Arbitrum chain and find two different states for the chain. Now it comes the time to resolve the dispute between them using interactive fraud proofs, note that this process happens on L1. So Alice and Bob are asked to point to the exact step they started to disagree on (we call this the bisection protocol). And all the L1 does is to execute the chain from that point using the inbox contents. What sits on the inbox in plain word is (1) the inputs for each tx and (2) the intrsuctions to execute them. So it’d not be a correct to statement to say “the L1 "warehouses" these TXs, but has no comprehension as to what these transactions mean”.
undefined says Hey, is there any reason for a missing "status" page?
undefined says ok. So if i understand now:

- Sequencers update the state root of the rollup contract on the L1, and after the delay period elapses, a "confirmed" state is derived. Thus, the L1 is aware of the most recent canonical state of the rollup
- The L1 receives and warehouses L2 TXs, and its not that the L1 *can't* understand these TXs, but rather it chooses to passively ignore them (unless called upon to interpret)
- When a fraud dispute arises, this is when the L1 will flip into "consiousness" mode and actually extract and decipher the L2 TXs
- To mitigate the amount of cost/execution in the above step, we try and narrow the interactive fraud proof down as succinctly as possible, ie where the disagreement in STF occurs between the parties, so the L1 doesnt have to re-execute the whole batch

is that correct?
undefined says Was the @arbitrum network temporary halt an accident or did someone exploited the bug to revert over and over and deplete the gas from the sequencer?
undefined says check the announcement channel for the post mortem
undefined says The Arbitrum network did not halt during the recent incident. https://twitter.com/ArbitrumDevs/status/1667333516441403393
undefined says 1. Validator (staker) will do it not sequencer. Sequencer is just ordering txs. Validators will put RBlocks to L1 rollup contract. The rest is true
2 & 3 & 4.  The batched, compressed transactions would be sent back to the mainnet by sequencer. Then in the challenge event, challengers can use those as source to prove if it will results in the posted state of the chain or not.
Validators cannot change those batched compressed transactions, cause sequencer would send them and it has nothing to do with validators
You can read it in detail from here:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#resolving-disputes-using-interactive-fraud-proofs
undefined says ok thanks for clarifying. In current  model though, isn't the centralized sequencer the only system validator?
undefined says Np!
No they are different actually.
Each of them has it’s own infra
undefined says oh, good to know
undefined says another question i had:

I'm still struggling to comprehend how the L1 contract can perform this fraud resolution function, even with knowledge of the previous valid L2 state root and access to all the L2 TXs from the batch. 

Being able to apply TXs from the batch would imply that the L1 contract knows all the leaves of the L2 state tree...which the L1 doesnt? And if it somehow did, wouldn't we lose all the scalability benefits?
undefined says 
undefined says Sorry your question is regarding non-interactive or interactive?
undefined says We have interactive proving implemented on Arbitrum
undefined says for sake of simplicity, lets just assume non interactive
undefined says For interactive:
L1 won’t execute the transactions actually. It won’t apply them for execution.
What will happen is that challenger and the staker would provide their claim for the output and dividing it down to find the the exact operation that they are not agree on.
When they reach to that point, L1 can check which one of them are true by execution of that single operation.
If you want to see how L1 do that, you can see the one step proving implementation here:

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/tree/main/src/osp
undefined says Actually these two are completely different systems and they have different ways of implementation
undefined says does this imply both challengers have to disclose their entire array of L2 state?

even in the interactive/bisectional model, you're just boiling down to a super granular point where the two parties have a divergence in the state transition function

lets say Party A and Party B both agree that TX1 should be applied, but are getting differing state roots. Implies that somewhere in the array, there is a divergence in one (or more) of their state leaves. 

seems like this falls back on the L1 to resolve the discrepancy via re-execution, but it needs the full merkle tree view to "autonomously" interpret the correct merkle root output (and thereby determine the winner), but that effectively turns the rollup contract into a full node, when in reality the contract is just a light node logging roots?

curious to understand where my logic goes wrong
undefined says The L1 has to intervene only when there's a dispute. And yes, it has to re-execute but only from that exact point that party A and party B started to have different outputs for the chain.
undefined says I highly recommend reading this section of our docs:
https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/
where every step of the process is explained thoroughly and should clear your doubts.
undefined says Do you have a reference link to the recent abitrum network outage ?
undefined says Hey @kooroot Here is the post mortem report of the recent incident : https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/978694555127930900/1116892782817185852
undefined says Thanks a lot sir!
undefined says You're welcome

undefined says The #💻︱protocol  has provided you with detailed answers
undefined says Looking to "Benchmark"  Arbitrum for a research project (aka standardized performance rating system). Currently, we are having an issue defining transaction finality due to the challenge period. "Transaction Throughput" is an easy metric to define over the challenge period. "Latency" is the issue. I currently cannot come up with a method to rate Arbitrum without giving it a crappy latency due to the challenge period. I was wondering how you would define transaction finality and achieve your numbers to hopefully inspire a new method.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs could you please help here ?
undefined says Hey,
Actually we defined two different types of finality.

Fast finality: if you trust our sequencer, you can just use its feed to get the ordered transactions. If you wanna check that, you can subscribe to sequencer feed and check how long it takes for your tx to show up in the feed
undefined says Safe finality: as you said you need to wait for dispute period which 7 days
undefined says There's one more type of finality which is once the sequencer's batch is finalized on L1, all nodes can deterministically figure out the corresponding L2 block which cannot be changed by an L1 reorg. This happens fairly quickly, most of the time is just waiting on Ethereum L1 finality. The only things you'd have to worry about there would be some code bug, all validators being malicious, or the security council being malicious.
undefined says Perfect Thank you!
undefined says Is this the implementation of AVM inside a smart contract on L1? We need that because EVM cannot automatically understand Arbitrum opcodes, right?
undefined says we use wasm for low-level instructions, so the op codes that are compared at the contract level are wasm op codes. We simply compile Geth/ArbOS down to that level. See https://developer.arbitrum.io/why-nitro for more info
undefined says this is also what enables us to easily add support for additional languages, like Rust, which is coming soon with the Stylus upgrade
undefined says When bridging funds L1->L2, depositEth function is called on Inbox contract, which pushes the message to the bridge queue. How does the sequencer pick up the message and execute on L2? Does it constantly queries bridge contract for new messages, or listens for emitted events?

Also what happens in the case sequencer doesn't execute L2 transaction (is this even possible)? edit: If sequencer doesn't execute it, we can call "ForseInclusion" method on Inbox contract?
undefined says I think you have misunderstood the Sequencer’s role. The sequencer isn’t the State Transition Function — it just plays a special role in deciding the inputs to that function. i.e., it orders txes in the inbox, which nodes execute themselves to determine if they revert or not. 

forceInclusion can be used if a sequencer is down for a long period. Let’s assume a tx is put in the delayed Inbox and the sequencer is down (so it can’t include the tx in a batch). Instead, you can use SequencerInbox’s forceInclusion method. Once a message has been in the delayed Inbox for a sufficient amount of time forceInclusion can be called to move it from the delayed Inbox into the core Inbox, at which point it’s finalized and ready for the nodes to execute it. Crucially, any address can call forceInclusion.

undefined says Currently Arbitrum One has fairly low fees but I would like to know if they will be reduced even more or if I should just focus on Nova if I want lower fees
undefined says Nova has fees that are around 10x lower than Arbitrum One, and it is designed for high-volume applications.
undefined says Ultimately, the best way to decide which network to use is to consider your specific needs.
undefined says Arbitrum One is better suited for DeFi applications because it has a higher level of security and trustlessness. Nova is better suited for social and gaming applications because it has lower fees and faster transaction speeds.
undefined says Hey! I understand that yes, I just like Arbitrum One infrastructure more since its a bit more decentralized and I would like to know if the fees could go down a bit further. I always prefer the most decentralized solution but my users might not agree because of the fees. 😁 My case is a social network so I might need to go with nova tho
undefined says the best way to decide which network to use for your application is to consider your specific needs.

 If you need a high level of security and trustlessness, then Arbitrum One is a good option. If you need low fees and fast transaction speeds, then Nova is a good option 💙
undefined says Sounds good 😃 Thanks for the help
undefined says No worries 🫂

undefined says In block 70523241, the L2 Base Fee (0xbF5041Fc07E1c866D15c749156657B8eEd0fb649) gets the total amount of l2 gas used by transactions multiplied by 0.1 Gwei. But the receipt_effective_gas_price for all transactions in the block is 0.10055 Gwei. Could someone explain to me this difference?
undefined says 
undefined says Currently at the Distributed Computing Lab (DCL) at EPFL, we are working in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation. We are currently conducting performance and security evaluations of layer 2 systems on a local Ethereum network.
Our next goal is to run a local instance of Arbitrum over this network. I have attempted to find an online tutorial for deploying Arbitrum but without success.
As I'm new to Arbitrum, and still learning from the documentation, I'm not fully comfortable yet. I'm reaching out for a step-by-step explanation of how to deploy Arbitrum, specifically for a minimal setup.

thanks
undefined says Hey, what kind of setup you mean? Node or smart contract?
undefined says Sorry, I don’t get what you mean total amount of l2 gas used by transaction multiplied by 0.1 gwei.
undefined says I mean, given an Ethereum network, what should be deployed in order to have a working Arbitrum network running on top of it? This includes: what kind of nodes need to run? How many of them (or what is the minimum number)? Which smart contracts need to be deployed on the ethereum network? I actually also wrote a post on the research forum of Arbitrum (see "Performance and security evaluation of Arbitrum") that asks this.
undefined says When does the L2 Surplus Fee balance change? I need to understand the use cases
undefined says Ok, you can see how orbit built (a layer3 which is based on arbitrum): https://developer.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-gentle-introduction , it has the same thing you need to do includes smart contract and nodes.
undefined says I'll have a look, thank you
undefined says 
undefined says What is the fastest way to get on chain information (for example swap rates)? Is it running my own full node and accessing it via websocket?
undefined says running your own full node would give you the ability to query it more cheaply but often times you'll get a fast response from 3rd party node providers if you don't want the overhead of running a node
undefined says Ok but I am doing a lot of requests, so I think I need my own node. But Websocket is faster than rpc right? What does Sequencer Feed mean? Is this a even faster alternative than websocket?
And Ethics is talking about geth, mempool and nitro in case of speed. Can I read about these somewhere?
undefined says When you run your node, it’ll connect to the Sequencer Feed, using a web socket.
Sequencer Feed would just give you ordered transactions. So when your node receives new ordered txs, it will execute it locally and transit to the new state
undefined says We don’t have a mempool on Arbitrum, you send your txs to sequencer, and sequencer will pick them up on first come first serve basis. Whenever picked transactions, it will publish them through sequencer feed, so that nodes know the next state
undefined says You can find more info on our docs:

https://developer.arbitrum.io/intro/
undefined says Little Question: Why are they only few TXs in a block ?
undefined says If transactions are executed fcfs, why do we set a priority fee for our transactions?
undefined says the priority fee is optional and refunded if present
undefined says it's just there for wallet compatibility
undefined says Blocks on Arbitrum are creating so fast. There are two main rules for block creation on Arb. 
1. Block will be created just if there is a new tx
2. Minimum block period is currently 250ms

So based on this, and the demand, blocks may contain number of txs, but because block production is so fast, in most cases there are a limited number of txs in a block
undefined says I do have two questions. 
I thought the fastest way to get on chain information (for example swap rates) I should use websocket (faster than rpc request). But wouldn’t it be faster to read from the sequencer feed directly?
What happens if I subscribe to a websocket event and my code needs longer to run after I got a message than it needs to get the next message from the node? Will there be a delay for the received message or is the program running on the new message during the old message is still being processed? 
Thank you guys
undefined says Hey,
For listening to sequencer feed, you need to run your own node, and then subscribe to feed which is would be a ws communication
undefined says for the second question, Nitro nodes are implemented to handle these situations for sure. Sequencer will give you the ordered transactions, and your node will transit the state based on that
undefined says I am running my own node and I opened port 8548 with this addition to docker start command for websocket connection:
`--ws.port=8548 --ws.addr=0.0.0.0 --ws.origins=*` so for sequencer feed I have to do exactly the same with port 9642 as far as I can see in the docs right? Then I would connect to this address as websocket: `ws://..myIP..:9642`
undefined says Yes, but feed messages only give you the tx and the order of tx, it doesn’t have any state information, you need use your node to run it to get the latest blockchain state.
undefined says 
undefined says So my node has to do the sequencer work as well? I am not able to read the sequencer from another node?
undefined says Hey @Dani92 ,
you can connect to the Sequencer's feed directly to read the data published by the Sequencer. In the short term, however, that feed will be compressed with a custom dictionary, so you'll have to run a feed relay => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-feed-relay
From the feed, you'll get all messages published by the Sequencer, in the order established by the Sequencer => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/read-sequencer-feed

If you're interested in the state of the chain after certain transaction, you'll have to run a node which, as Mehdi and Jason mentioned, will take care of ordering and processing the transactions received.
undefined says 
undefined says Hey José!
I want to run a full arb node in order to have quicker reads and cheaper rpc requests. But to run it I also need a mainnet rpc.. How many requests is the full node going to make a day approximately to my mainnet rpc?
undefined says If you run a fullnode, it’ll listen to sequencer feed through websocket, and it’s so fast. Nodes also listen to L1 to be sure that the ordered transactions that sequencer sent you through feed, is being set to L1 as well!
So in terms of speed, it doesn’t related to L1 rpc
undefined says Any idea how many requests to the mainnet rpc are made daily from the arbitrum node?
undefined says I am running a full node and I check data with websocket. So websocket sends a new block and there is a certain info I send a transaction directly via code, my transaction does occur 4 blocks after the block I detected the info. What to do to get the transaction into the next block right away?
undefined says If I read it correctly I had approxemately 54.000 requests the last 24 hours
undefined says Interesting, it sounds a reasonable  amount
undefined says can someone help me decoding a L2MessageKind_Batch?
undefined says 
undefined says how can i review docs about relayer transaction ?
I want to detail about 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000C8 on arbiscan
undefined says yes
undefined says Hey, that address is nodeinterface, which you can call through rpc to get some basic information about arbitrum, here is the interface: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/v2.0.14/contracts/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L25
undefined says You can see code here, it shows how to decode that type msg: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/blob/main/packages/batch-tx-handler/src/l1-batch-handler/utils.ts#L97
undefined says Arbitrum follows first in first serve order model, so there is no priority fees to let your tx got confirmed faster.
undefined says Thank you
undefined says I cannot figure out two moments:
If user send transaction to local node, it will be relayed to other nodes 'till it reach sequencer or it will send directly to inbox via https after pre-validating by local?
Where I can read how Arbitrum's discovery protocol is actually works?
undefined says It will forward to sequencer directly, you can tx life cycle here: https://developer.arbitrum.io/tx-lifecycle
undefined says And how node get back execution result? It's broadcasted back via feed endpoint of sequincer?
The main question is: how to get the most recent state with minimum delay.
undefined says is there anyway to view every transaction whcih has been challenged?
undefined says When your node receives feed messages, it will execute the tx and get the latest state. ( feed message doesn’t contain state)
undefined says Hey Arb team - I'm trying to fidn the highest recorded load on Arbitrum - any ideas where to look for stress tests? I can find blogs claiming 40k tps but trying to find some more concrete evidence of high throughput / load - any ideas where to look?
undefined says who is claiming 40K TPS? in practice, it spikes to up to a few hundred transactions per second
undefined says you could always run an archive node and query the history, there's also L2Beat: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum;
undefined says I'm trying to understand what kind of transactions are occuring on the ARB bridge. I don't see anywhere that shows recent transactions on the ARB bridge and there is no API that I can find that shows this.

I'm trying to understand what are the different tokens that people are exchanging for ARB. In essence I want to understand the volumes of different tokens into ARB.

Am I missing something?
undefined says Sorry didn't get your question. Do you mean you wanna check for tokens that are exchanged for ARB token on L2? Or you want to see all tokens that are bridge from L1 to L2?
undefined says 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD - burn address

undefined says thank you sir
undefined says I try to decode the sequencer feed.
I am just interested in transactions, so I am filtering: `...header.kind= 4` at first. 
Then I filter the transaction with: `let tx = ethers.utils.parseTransaction(base64.slice(1));`
No I am checking the `tx.to` field from the transaction to see with which dex router it is interacting (To get information which abis to use later).
Now I am checking `tx.data` to get information about which function is called with: `const functionSelector = transactionData.slice(0, 10);`
Now I am comparing to the specific contract from lets say Camelot dex like this:
`let decodedData = await router_camelot.interface.decodeFunctionData(functionSelector,transactionData);`
But I cannot find the function... Can someone help me?
functionSelector is looking like this for Camelot dex: `0xb4822be3` but this function is not in the abis...
undefined says Not sure if I got your question properly, but it's not doable to find out exact function abi from the feed itself. Just as you said you can find the function selector. 
But you can use signature dbs and check if this db can resolve the function signature into the function abi:
https://www.4byte.directory/
undefined says Also it has API so you can have it automated
undefined says Hey bruvs, is there any data available on Arbitrum’s tx confirmation times? When I make a tx on arbitrum it seems like it confirms basically instantly but I’d like to know the estimated number of seconds it’s supposed to take.

Thnx
undefined says You mean how long will sequencer takes to accept your tx? It depends on the network, our sequencer's minium block time is 0.25s. And if you mean tx finality, there is also no fixed times, you can call eth_getBlockByNumber with finalize tag to get the latest finalize block.
undefined says With BOLD, is there still a use for forced transaction inclusion thru the delayed inbox queue?  Does anyone know? thx
undefined says yep - force inclusion is unrelated to BOLD. Force-inclusion is about  ensuring *inputs* can get included (regardless of the sequencer's behavior), BOLD is about confirming *outputs* (i.e., the state root, proposed by validators)
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Does anyone know how I can successfully call the ArbSys contract without the "invalid opcode" error?. I tried to make the call from my contract but it keeps throwing that error
undefined says Hey, which function did you call?
undefined says Can i see arbitrum relayer transaction structure or specs ?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/execution/forwarder.go
undefined says Been thinking about a theoretical scenario, what happens if let's say there is a 100m users on Arb and there is a sequencer faliure and the users start rusing to the L1 escape hatch, the L1 just can't handle that many users exiting how can people get back their money from the L2?
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says Why would the L1 not handle all transactions? Keep in mind that L2->L1 transactions function differently than L1->L2 transactions => https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l2-to-l1-messaging
There wouldn't be any problem with users exiting Arbitrum, they could all send their L2->L1 (withdraw) transactions and claim their funds after 7 days.
undefined says Well, quick math. The L1 can handle ~13 TPS ovb every tx consumes different gas but just simplify the things. If there is some issue witht the L2 and users start rusing to the escape hatch then the L1 troughput is simply not enought to handle that many users. And after blocks fill up gas would spike but then small fish can't exit if they don't wan't to pay 100s of dollars in gas
undefined says In your scenario, Ethereum gas would spike if everyone tries to claim their funds at the same time via the Outbox contract, but they don't necessarily need to do so. Once the challenge period is passed, funds are free to be claimed on L1 without any L2 interaction, so there isn't any urgency to do that. Users might want to wait until the gas price is within a range that's comfortable for them to claim.
undefined says But still if all the users just wan't to claim their founds on the L1 it would take like 90 days assuming there is no other activity on ETH.
undefined says Your scenario is very unlikely to occur, but your math is correct. You'll have to take other things into consideration though, like if there's a high demand for transactions, that TPS might probably increase within some ranges.
But back to your point, that's precisely one of the problems of Ethereum: Scalability. And that's what Arbitrum and other L2s are trying to solve. Arbitrum allows for faster and cheaper transactions, improving scalability while inheriting Ethereum security. But if you move Arbitrum's scalability to Ethereum, you're going to create bottleneck there.
In any case, Ethereum will handle all those transactions eventually.
undefined says Thx for the answer mate!
undefined says `sendTxToL1` function
undefined says Are you calling onchain or using a local development tool (eg. hardhat node or foundry anvil)? Some of the local tooling doesn't properly support arbitrum precompiles. If you aren't already, I'd try your code on arbitrum goerli

Is this distributing to investors? A total of over 550 million tokens transferred 6 hours ago
undefined says 
undefined says Yep, this was an investor distribution. Not vested though, just unvested tokens that hadn't been transferred to the investor yet sent to smart contract wallets enforcing the vesting lockup non-custodially
undefined says got it. Thank you for the reply
undefined says Thanks. I'll try it out on goerli
undefined says 
undefined says I was reading the Arbitrum docs/deep dive and would really appreciate if someone could confirm my understanding on how Arbitrum works?

1. If a sequencer is honest, it batches transactions to an L1 smart contract inbox. Users can alternatively post messages to L1 smart contract directly.
2. Validators run the messages using Arbitrum VM and publish the state -- or some variation of the state -- of Arbitrum (called RBlocks) to the L1 smart contracts. 
3. If a transaction is invalid (e.g. user attempts to withdraw tokens they don't have), VM will reject the transaction. A validator (probably pseudo-randomly?) is chosen to propose an an RBlock. If it is invalid an honest validator is incentivized to challenge it to get part of the dishonest validator's staked ETH.
4. If a sequencer is dishonest, the worst it can do is reject or reshuffle transactions. Out of curiosity, if the current sequencer node gets hacked, what would be the course of action? I am guessing the DNS will be rerouted to a different server?
5. It is more scalable and has less gas fees than L1 because of compression and transaction batching.
6. Out of curiosity, has a similar solution been attempted for L1? Heavy contract calls get run off-chain and then the results of the calls get passed to L1 and a challenge period is also applied. This would directly improve the scalability of L1. I guess the concurrency edge cases are difficult to handle in this case?
undefined says Hey, 
1. yes, but the target user post tx to l1 is delayed inbox, it needs wait sequencer to include it or force inclusion after some period. 
2.here is the rblock structure: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/rollup/Node.sol#L21, it will post the state hash, and l2->l1 mesg merkle root and so on.
4.Sequencer only have the power to order tx, it cannt make any decision about the state, so as you said, when sequencer got hacked, it won’t affect Arbitrum’s state, you don’t need to worry the your assert on Arbitrum, and you can still send tx via l1 delayed inbox and force inclusion it.
5.Not only this, and the execution/state is also not on l1, state changes is the most expensive part when you execute the tx.
6.Hmm, you might mean plasma, but it is also a layer2 type network. Because plasma doesn’t post tx data to l1, so it is not widely used now.
undefined says I have a question. I understand that the reason for the difference in fees between Arbitrum Nitro and Arbitrum Nova is that the DA is a DAC and not on-chain. 

I'm checking through the source code, but all I can see is a difference in L2gasPrice of 0.01 / 0.001 gwei. 

Can you share which resources I can refer to to get a clearer understanding of the Tx cost difference between Nitro and Nova?
undefined says Just as you said, da storage is the main difference between arbitrum one and arbitrum nova: https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/public-chains
undefined says Yes, i know.  I'd like to see the tx cycle or source code where anyTrust is storing data through the Data Availability Committee, but I'm not sure where to start since it's so extensive.🥹
undefined says Ok, I have 2 images about the tx cycle for you:
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/arbnode/batch_poster.go#L845
undefined says Oh, Thx. i didn’t know detail working process cycle. 

So,, instead of 1) submitting to the Data Availability Committee and 2) submitting to DAC → L1, it costs less because it's handled by DAC?
undefined says When sequencer send da to dac, the dac will give a DACert, then sequencer will post the DACert to l1. So yes, it costs less because it's handled by DAC not l1.
undefined says Oh My God... make sense...(https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization#data-availability-committee-members) i seen 6-of-7. 
If so, do they receive any of the network fees generated by Arbitrum Nova?
undefined says Yes, you can see the details of fee paid to dac on part 3: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup
undefined says The decision was made for a distribution of 20% of the L2 base fee on the Arbitrum Nova chain with a split of 8% to the Data Availability Committee and 12% to the Arbitrum Nova Validators.
undefined says oh i got it i got it,,
undefined says Thanks a lot, that's really helpful! A few follow up questions:

1. I read on the docs that moving the sequencer to a set of nodes is in progress and being researched but am curious why can't a pre-existing consensus solution work here?
2. Come to think of it, what are the downsides to NOT using L1 to directly publish to the inbox. If there were no sequencer and users directly submitted to the L1, there would be consensus on the ordering. I guess the answer is gas fees but shouldn't **gas fees**[20 separate compressed transaction] ~= **gas fees**[1 compressed batch of 20 transactions]? Could you explain why not please. Docs also say because the nodes have to wait for a number of ethereum block confirmations which makes sense. 
3. In practice, how often does it happen that a RBlock is challenged? I imagine very rarely due to the incentives. 
4. For the L1 chain idea what I was thinking was:

- Let's say Uniswap v3 computations want to be done off-chain to save gas. 
- Users post transactions to some smart contract similar to what's done in Arbitrum.
- Then off-chain nodes run the Uniswap v3 code and produce the results via optimistic rollups.
- They post the results (balance changes) to the smart contract and, hence, avoid the need for all ethereum nodes to run the heavy computations. Instead, ethereum nodes only update the state of the chain.
- This way a separate chain won't be necessary. (Obviously a separate chain has its advantages but am curious if something similar directly for L1 exists). However, I suppose the concurrency edge cases are difficult/impossible to handle?
undefined says 1. A couple reasons here: A) Leader based consensus systems are possible, but would allow for the leader at any given block to maliciously extract MEV vs more sophisticated systems, B) Latency is very important for L2 UX so many consensus algorithms would degrate the user experience by being too slow
2. This is possible and was the original design of Arbitrum actually before a sequencer was introduced. A similar idea is described here more recently https://ethresear.ch/t/based-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-sequencing/15016. This sort of design is totally possible, but A) The latency would be much worse and B) There are fixed costs associated with batch posting which is why a single batch of 20 transactions is significantly cheaper C) Compression is also much more effective when there's more data being compressed
3. On arbitrum one and arbitrum nova this has never happened. Currently validation is permissioned with a bunch of different parties whitelisted, but nobody who's been actively malicious or buggy. Offchain Labs has been developing BOLD (https://medium.com/offchainlabs/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc) as a way to drop that perimissioning. Challenges have occured though both on testnet for testing as well as on the arbitrum one fork on EthPOW
4. You can totally have an application specific rollup like you described. I'd say the main argument against would be I don't think you gain that much vs using a general purpose rollup chain since you need basically all the same components
undefined says Thank you so much for explaining this in so much detail! All of that makes a lot of sense. 

I read the book *Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction* a few months ago and it was probably the best book I read for Crypto from a CS perspective. Given the newest developments (L2, bridges, etc.), I am wondering if you have or could recommend any similar set of writings I could read to improve my intuition further for the new technologies?
undefined says Hmm can't say I have any specific book recommendations, but https://research.arbitrum.io/ and https://ethresear.ch/ are always great at keeping on top of new ideas
undefined says Thank you!
undefined says Does Arbitrum post event-roots on to Ethereum?
undefined says Hey, we post the transaction data to ethereum, wdym by event-root? Is state root? If so, we post by validator: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/rollup/Node.sol#L23, and you can verify your l2 state by: https://github.com/ensdomains/arb-resolver#how-l2-state-verification-on-l1-works
undefined says Oh just in time, arbitrum supports ens names? that means when I buy an ens name on eth it will also appear on arbitrum ?
undefined says They have arb goerli resolver, but not mainnet resolve shown: https://github.com/ensdomains/arb-resolver , you can also ask them for the mainnet updates.
undefined says guys, a little help. I tried to use a subgraph to reduce contract calls, however, the subgraph is delayed by nearly 200 blocks. any idea why? testing it on goerli
undefined says Hey guys, I've been trying to understand BOLD, and been reading the paper found on the Github repo. I see that certain proofs are omitted (and will be in the full paper).

Where can I find this full paper?
undefined says Hey,
It's not been released yet. Will be released soon!
undefined says Can you share the subgraph endpoint and code so we can see what's happening? Maybe you use some heavy computation logic which prevents subgraph to keep up with the head. In normal cases it takes <100ms to process new block so there should be no problems
undefined says I optimised the code a little and it loads somewhat faster now. still a delay of around 10s. I will share it here, maybe you can have some more ideas on how to go about it. 
We have a meeting with Nick (from offchain Labs) in a couple of hours from now. Let me handle that one first. 
thanks for your help.

PS: I really like your name.
undefined says Haha thanks!

Awesome yea, send it over so that we could take a look and see! :arbiblobblue:
undefined says will do. thanks again 🙂
undefined says i have a simply questions,
why arbitrum block gas limit is so high..?
undefined says nope, is this related about wallet?
undefined says The gas limit for execution is 32m and it is 2m higher than l1
undefined says i saw that block gas limit: `1,125,899,906,842,624` in arbitrum scan.
undefined says Where can I find the execution gas limit 32m that you mentioned?
undefined says Oh, I think that's it.
`const InitialPerBlockGasLimitV6 uint64 = 32 * 1000000`
undefined says You can also call https://arbiscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006c#readContract and funcation is GetGasAccountingParams, the third one is per block limit
undefined says okay, then first value `7000000` what does mean??
undefined says ```
const InitialSpeedLimitPerSecondV0 = 1000000
const InitialPerBlockGasLimitV0 uint64 = 20 * 1000000
const InitialSpeedLimitPerSecondV6 = 7000000
const InitialPerBlockGasLimitV6 uint64 = 32 * 1000000 // execution gas limit 32M
```
I'm wondering what these values mean. what differences V0 and V6?
undefined says tx speed per second, if the current speed above 7m, the gas price will increase
undefined says It is different consensus version, v0 is outdated
undefined says thanks!! Can you explain the rest of the variables...?
```
InitialGasPoolSeconds = 10 * 60 // 600s (10m)
const InitialRateEstimateInertia = 60
const InitialPricingInertia = 102
const InitialBacklogTolerance = 10
```
i already read the docs, arbitrum fee model is so difficulty...
undefined says We now don't have gas pool any more, the current model is only gas used for execution and gas used for l1, which you can see this on arbiscan tx advanced info like this: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x2ad926eafa9f95c14756459f44a8421160704b29a9ce6dff91d4dde87eed4f2d#txninfo
undefined says Thank you so much, I'm still looking at the source now and trying to understand. If I can figure out how `Poster Fee`, `Network Fee`, `L1 Gas Used` and `L2 Gas Used` are calculated in explorer as you said, I think all my questions will be solved.
undefined says For tx sender, the poster fee you will pay in the l1 gas used part, the network fee includes in l2 gas used part.
undefined says the l2 gas used is calculated as how much evm opcode execution cost which is same to ethereum, the l1 gas used depends on your tx size because we need to include your tx data on l1, this is used to pay l1 gas fee.
undefined says So, are there L1 gas calculate fomulars?
undefined says L1 Estimated Cost (L1C) = L1 price per byte of data (L1P) * Size of data to be posted in bytes (L1S)
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/how-to-estimate-gas
undefined says I think I've seen the formula for that. It is my understanding that Abitrum only uses the base fee and not the priority fee.
undefined says the base fee and the priority fee is gas price, which is different from gas used
undefined says gas cost = gas used * gas price
undefined says And we currently don'y charge priority fee, but as I mentioned, when gas speed above 7m, we will charge congestion fee
undefined says oh i know this is ed felten says 'timeboost'?
undefined says timeboost is not alive now, timeboost is priority fee. But congestion fee is when network busy, all tx needs to pay congestion fee to be confirmed
undefined says This is the first time I heard about this and thought it was very cooool, I look forward to seeing it alive soon.
undefined says You can see how timeboost works here: https://medium.com/offchainlabs/time-boost-a-new-transaction-ordering-policy-for-arbitrum-5b3066382d62
undefined says I have a lot of questions,,, I hope you don't mind if I ask a few more.
undefined says Sure you can ask
undefined says 1. Currently, Abitrum has an execution gas limit of 32M(you says) and a very high block gas limit. In addition, arbitrum don't use a priority fee value. So, is the base fee fixed at 0.1 gwei?
undefined says 2. If the base fee changes dynamically like EIP-1559, how much is the gas target set and what is the percentage increase/decrease?
undefined says 3. Where can I get the L1P value from `L1 Estimated Cost (L1C)` fomulas. If you can point me to the source code , it would be a great help to me for understand
undefined says 1. The block limit we always mean the execution limit, so it is 32m, and for l1 used, there is no limit. I sadi arbitrum has no priority fee, but we have congestion fee (only charge when gas speed avove 7m/s), so it is not fixed at 0.1gwei
undefined says It is the congestion fee changes dynamically like EIP-1559, it changes like this F = exp(-a(B-b)), where a and b are suitably chosen constants: a controls how rapidly the price escalates with backlog, and b allows a small backlog before the basefee escalation begins. You can see more info here: https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#gas-and-fees
undefined says You can call this https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L84 to get details of gas estimate
undefined says My messages keep getting blocked...! I'm really sorry, but can you check your messages just once?
undefined says How is this different from the `gasEstimateL1Component` function below the source code?
undefined says gasEstimateL1Component doessn't include l2 part
undefined says Sorry I missed too
undefined says Is the L1 gas cost unaffected?
undefined says Unaffected, you can see the comments within the code, it has related details
undefined says amazing, I was looking for this reason, it was in the comments?? I missed it, where is it...
undefined says Sorry, what unaffected you mean here? The l1 gas cost will affected by l1 gas price and the compress ratio, I thought you mean the differences between those 2 functions
undefined says This refers to the gas commonly found in this link: https://etherscan.io/gastracker. I keep getting rejected messages...
undefined says https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xbaf63f7934fe663a738c45ddeec17a66b58d72f44fabefb23ba304a1e3d0f9f7#txninfo To make it easier to understand, I brought in a new TX (ETH TRANSFER). 
Here i checked that L2 gas Used is 21,000 value and 21,000 * 0.01gwei value becomes Network Fee as you told me. so please tell me why L1 gas Used is 211,277. 
plz help me🙏
undefined says Because I lack the l1 calldata per byte cost and your tx related compress ratio at that time, so it hard to reproduce that amount now, but for new tx, you can call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L16 to get l1 calldata per byte cost, and then multiple your tx data size and the compress ratio (It is different each time). For example, if your tx data size is X, the l1 calldata cost per byte is Y, so the gas cost for l1 is (Y*X)/l2GasPrice. And for easier process, just call https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L84 will tell you each part.
undefined says For this type tx now (without calldata), we assume it will be 140 bytes to put on l1, and for now the l1 cost per byte is  184596691344, so the total cost for l1 is 184596691344 * 140 = 25843536788160, and div 100000000 (0.1 gwei), then it will be 258,435 gas used for l1 now.
undefined says Why `140 bytes` to put on l1 and how to seted l1 cost  `184596691344` value?
undefined says rlp encode according to tx type, get 140byte ?
undefined says It is just assume, each tx has different number
undefined says I'm curious about the formula to get that value.
undefined says Which value
undefined says For the formula to get l1 cost.
undefined says Hmm I should give you the example, and also the docs has, which part you are not clear?
undefined says oh amazing !! i understand it!! 
currently l1 calldata byte `194_601_508_224` (=194 gwei)
undefined says Yup
undefined says These two look similar...
undefined says Yes we have in line comments mentioned here: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/main/src/node-interface/NodeInterface.sol#L101-L104
undefined says does arbitrum runs own blockchain to update the states besides running the sequencers?
undefined says Yes, we also have a public rpc node: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs  was wondering how much you think proto-danksharding will scale down L1 posting costs to compared to today's calldata?
undefined says It really depends on different factors, the tx data, and also implementation, which we’re working on, but let’s say it’d be like ~12x cheaper to send it as blobs, instead of calldata
undefined says @Mehdi Salehi | Offchain Labs Got it, what factors are top of mind that drives the diff b/w blob costs vs call data for you?
undefined says This gas estimation tutorial example returns me zeros for gasEstimateForL1 and l1BaseFeeEstimate:
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/tree/master/packages/gas-estimation

I am running it against https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc

Is there any reason behind that? Thanks
undefined says Basically, the script is failing with 'division-by-zero' even if it is run unaltered
undefined says After more research, I concluded that NodeInterface.gasEstimateComponents always returns zeros for gasEstimateForL1 and l1BaseFeeEstimate. Same for NodeInterface.gasEstimateL1Component: it returns zeros gasEstimateForL1 and l1BaseFeeEstimate. This happens on Goerli only, estimations for mainnet transactions work fine. Is there anything I am missing? Or is there any alternative way to get gas estimates? I need to get estimates at least for L2G component
undefined says Hey, I'm trying to download the top 100.000 arb token holders data set and when I got to arbiscan and dw it it actually gives me the top 100.000 holders arranged numerically like this. I am looking to find out how can I extract the top 100.000 arb holders by arb holding, not by the address

can someone help me understand what's going on:arbiblobblue:
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs I'm here one more time for help! 
You says me that the block gas limit is 32M. But when I look at it in arbiscan, I see the number `1,125,899,906,842,624`, why is this? I don't think it's a meaningless number...
undefined says Because goerli's gas price is super low, so the l1 estimate gas return is unstable
undefined says You can change a source to download those data, we have some analytics app supports here: https://portal.arbitrum.io/?chains=arbitrum-one&categories=analytics , you can find one and download it
undefined says It is 2^50, I don't think it has any meanning when you calculate the gas limit
undefined says hmm... If so, it sounds like you guys are not applying EIP-1559. Right?
undefined says We just refer to eip1559 on the congestion fee mechanism (when the network usage increases, the congestion fee increases, and vice versa)
undefined says Okay, 'congestion fee', I'll look that one up later.

Also, I know your block time is 0.25s, but if that's the case, there should be 4 blocks in 1 second. It doesn't seem to be the case. And how does Batch post every few seconds?
undefined says No, our block time is not fixed, 0.25s is the minimum block time, it depends on the network
undefined says You can see all our bathches here: https://arbiscan.io/batches
undefined says Oh, The batch intervel looks to be around 2 minutes.
undefined says Thanks for the quick response, I'm intersted in finding the top 100.000 or 50.000 holders according to their wallet holding. Where do you think I could get that one🙏
undefined says Does that mean I can ignore l1 gas on goerli and consider l2g component to be equal gasEstimate?
undefined says No, not all the time the l1 cost is zero, you still need to calculate both, but our eth_estimateGas returns both so you don't need to worry.
undefined says Hmm, I am not sure which one is the best to download, but you can check them.
undefined says Thank you. Will dive in and see if I can
undefined says do you know where I can call for all the historical transactions of Arbitrum's Stylus Testnet? I want to do a bigger research between gas used on Stylus vs the rest of the chains.
undefined says @Jason Wan | Offchain Labs
undefined says You can find those tx data on the blockchain explorer: https://stylus-testnet-explorer.arbitrum.io/, also you can call rpc to retrieve them: https://stylus-testnet.arbitrum.io/rpc
undefined says Guys, a doubt...with the competition of creating stacks for specific use cases, such as orbit, supernets, op stack etc, is the arbitrum nova (focused on game cases) being left out?
I haven't heard from her in a while... Do you believe it's a prioritization problem for Nitro? What would today make a game prefer to use the nova than, even orbit, or the other competitors, as the op stack?
undefined says Hey, arbitrum nova never being left out, because orbit can also be deployed on Nova, and they can also choose anytrust when they deploy l3. And stylus will also be deployed to Nova if dao approved that. So we are still going to upgrade nova and make it more faster and cheaper.
undefined says Jason, i have a question ! 
I looked at the gas estimate page on the bridge page and put in a random tx, where I saw that the data before compression was 232 bytes, and with compression in avitrum, it was 139 bytes. 
I was wondering about your compression algorithm, I know you use brotli, but could you tell me how calculated with the 232 bytes figure I see in the picture?
undefined says @aka🦋 Did you talk to the admin yet or opened a ticket support to get help?
undefined says I always ask here because there doesn't seem to be a ticket channel.
undefined says That right
undefined says Nice to know Jason! tnx.
But bro, I still have doubts, looking at the volumes , tvl and new applications  of nova, I see that it still hasn't had as much traction as nitro for example, do you have an opinion on that? What could have happened? 
In your opinion why would a gaming use case would prefer use nova archicteture over zkevm (or even immutable zkevm) for example?
undefined says do you believe is related to the impossibility of withdrawing your funds? Or that the network is not yet fully developed?
undefined says the 232 bytes would be the regular calldata sent to the rpc node along with the transaction. so if you look at the tx on Arbiscan it will show those bytes
undefined says You can use ethersjs to call `tx = provider.getTransaction(YourTxHASH)`, and then `serializedTx = ethers.Transaction.from(tx1!).serialized`, then the size of serializedTx is what your tx size
undefined says For gamming, it usually need to cost lots of gas than other regular dapps, and nova is much cheaper than other chains, also for security, nova can fallback to rollups if the dac went wrong, so nova is safe and low gas for gamming
undefined says Oh okay, so now going to compress this calldata using brotli on a block-by-block basis and the poster will submit it to l1, right?
undefined says The sequencer will compress the whole batch once (not just one block), you can see this script, it has how to decompress the data read from l1 and get tx from it: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-cli-tools/blob/main/packages/batch-tx-handler/README.md#l1-batch-handler
undefined says I have an issue, so I was trying to call sendL1FundedContractTransaction through the etherscan and I'm expecting the transaction to be executed at arbitrum but fo some reason it does not.
my tx hash is 0xe483cbd978aada9b2bc33bd0dbce5087d5a0aeb241fcd23f866e20ad8b0a84f1 and I'm trying to call 0x47ec4768502ada411bce8b973a6609f3f96061f3, is it possible to do such transaction ?
undefined says CROSSPOSTING - https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/859511259183448084/1151905980637003796

Hey folks, I'm looking to build some dashboards in dune since I realized there's no tool currently that shows L2 to L2 activity
Swaps, txn vol, unique address between ETH and Stables going to/from ARB > OP or OP > ARB

I found the optimism token contract list - https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json - is there something equivalent for arbitrum?
undefined says https://tokenlist.arbitrum.io/ArbTokenLists/arbed_coinmarketcap.json
undefined says that has all the bridged token contracts from tokens listed on coinmarketcap
undefined says anyway to access arbitrum via golang? I found a package may helpful here, https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/offchainlabs/arbitrum/packages/arb-provider-go@v0.7.2, but it has not been updated for 3 years, and I can't find the package in offchain github repos now.
undefined says Is there any estimate of when ENS will be available on arbitrum?
undefined says Please guys when will it be available?
undefined says Is the L2 gas constant at 0.1 GWEI on Arb? If in the same block, can I get prio with higher gas fee?
undefined says Arbitrum processes txs in a first come first served order, so there is no priority fee to let your tx get confirmed faster.  
(We do have a congestion fee though which is only charged when gas speed goes above 7m/s, so the L2 base fee is not fixed at the 0.1 gwei)
undefined says Arbitrum uses the standard RPC interface so if you want to interact with a contract on Arbitrum using golang you can use any library that supports Ethereum. There's not a huge amount of tooling there, but generally go-ethereum contains code that can be used for this, but in general golang support for writing client side tools for interacting with ethereum rpc isn't great
undefined says You'd have to reach out to the ENS team for more info on what their plans are
undefined says gn,can you help me please, what if I'm sending tx via createRetryableTicket from l1 to l2 and it has been reverted at l2, where does the msg.value goes, is it possible to withdraw it?
undefined says Answered over in #💻︱protocol
undefined says if i would like to bridge a token using CCTP how should i do it? how can i get arbitrum bridge to support CCTP for my token?
undefined says Hey, CCTP and the Arbitrum Bridge are two different technologies. For CCTP, it's better to ask Circle, who built it, but you have documentation in their portal => https://developers.circle.com/stablecoin/docs/cctp-getting-started

For the Arbitrum Bridge, you have several ways of making your token bridgeable (https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/token-bridge/token-bridge-erc20). I see you've already shown interest in the standard gateway and the generic-custom gateway.

What problem are you trying to solve?
undefined says i have been trying to build my L2 token that is basically the same as USDC native
undefined says but how was USDC native made bridgeable on Arbitrum Bridge?
undefined says We integrated CCTP's API into the bridge for that specific flow, so users can bridge native USDC if they wish to. If they want to bridge wrapped USDC, they'd go the regular Arbitrum Bridge way.

If you want to make your token behave like native USDC (burning in one layer and minting in another), you'd have to go the custom gateway route => https://docs.arbitrum.io/devs-how-tos/bridge-tokens/how-to-bridge-tokens-custom-gateway

But keep in mind that the use cases for needing this gateway are rare. Also, as my colleague mentioned, keep in mind that a well-defined source of truth (in L1 or L2) is essential for effectively managing your token.
undefined says I came across a list of snapshots for state syncing at this link: https://snapshot.arbitrum.foundation/index.html. I'm curious about the process behind these snapshots. Are they captured centrally by the Arbitrum Foundation or by third-party service providers they commission? I'd appreciate any insights on this
undefined says They are not provided by 3rd party
undefined says Is there a late rollup penalty in Arbitrum? If there is a penalty, is there any documentation divided into past and present ?
undefined says During fraud proof, we have timeout mechanism, if the validator can't submit their proof on time during challenge, they will lose their stake: https://docs.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#the-real-dissection-protocol
undefined says Thanks~ I will view this docs.
undefined says Is there anyway to simulate a transaction(get the result receipts, logs) on a local arb node? 
If it's not possible, anyway to build a custom version of nitro to support the simulation?(I manage to do this on geth before)
undefined says Hey, it depends : nitro doesn't have anything specific for simulating transactions (eth_estimateGas does something like that, but only to return an estimate of gas amount for running your tx, not your use case if I understood correctly). But nitro has geth at its core, so you might be able to reuse part of what you did for geth (assuming there's some forking involved, this will depend on your technical knowledge to change the code, but keep in mind that there are many things custom to Arbitrum chains).
If you can use a 3rd party service, Tenderly does exactly what you're looking for: https://tenderly.co/
undefined says i'm subscribing to the sequencer feed, but some txs are not received by it - and then I see they are confirmed on arbiscan
how can this be?
undefined says Hey guys. Where is the best place to ask questions about using UniswapV3's TWAP oracle, and the implications of doing so on Arbitrum (specifically re: the sequencer and tx ordering)? Thanks
How does using the TWAP oracle work on Arbitrum? Blocks are confirmed on Arbitrum about every 1 second. But then there is a rollup to batch data back to ETH mainnet. 

On Arbitrum, does the TWAP then work differently than on mainnet? Not just as a function of time, but mechanically/programmatically? Thanks

Seeing from Uniswap Labs research (can't share links in this server) that the TWAP is updated block-by-block, that it cannot be manipulated therefore by just a single atomic swap in/out. 

See the image:
i.e "at the end of the block"
So that made me curious how TWAPs actually work on Arbitrum

undefined says What is the diff between `sol_storage!`  and `#[solidity_storage]` ?
undefined says Is it just the way the types are written? in `sol_storage!` it is basically like solidity, but in both cases it is the same in the EVM trie
undefined says @Haythem sol storage! Lets you write solidity code within to define structs that will be translated into rust code that is storage backed. #[solidity_storage] can be added directly to rust structs to give them storage backings
undefined says Why owner is returning Address and Vector, not only address? (I'm also a rust noob XD)

```
    pub fn owner(&self) -> Result<Address, Vec<u8>> {
        Ok(self.owner.get())
    }
```
undefined says @Haythem all good, we’re excited for you to look more into the sdk! Result means something can fail. It will either return an address or an error. The error type is a vector of bytes
undefined says Result is a common rust pattern for error handling
undefined says We're going to soon let it be just `Address` if the method is infallible. The SDK is a work in progress, and we're super interested in whatever friction you run into
undefined says When running `cargo stylus check` inside the `examples/erc20`

```
undefined says I think you need a newer rust version. Try `rustup update` if you're using rustup (recommended)
undefined says Ah yeah working now, thnx
undefined says Is it possible to write modifier or need to write it as a function?
undefined says Right now you need a function
undefined says Btw we're about to roll out an upgrade to the hello-world contract in around an hour that'll cut costs. We mistakenly configured a large stack size
undefined says If you want it early, add
```rs
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-zstack-size=32768",
]
```
to your `.cargo/config`
undefined says niice
undefined says I don't get the `setter` function, it is meant to set value in storage right?
undefined says Almost, it gives you a handle to a slot in storage, which you can then use to set the value
undefined says Although you can often just `.set` directly
undefined says ~~Ah, so it is only used for mapping? and vars like bool and uint256 can use .set directly?~~

Why when updating `balance` in the erc20, it uses .setter to get that slot and then .set, vs when changing total_supply it just used .set()?
undefined says Oh oops, we should change that, nice catch
undefined says This is great feedback, much appreciated
undefined says :Stylus:
undefined says Oh looking at it now, in `transfer_impl` what's happening is we're using the setter to call `get`
undefined says Like you'll see in the comments, we're going to make storage manipulation much prettier. Ideally you'd just do
```rs
self.balances[address] -= value;
```
undefined says But right now it's a bit verbose
undefined says so I can't just do now `self.balances.get(address)` ?
undefined says You can
undefined says Our method documentation on docs.rs is generating right now, but soon you'll have a page where you can browse all the methods
undefined says In `self.balances` case, you'd see it's a `StorageMap`, and then be able to look at all the methods of `StorageMap` with comments detailing what they do
undefined says We're 57th in the queue here 🙂
https://docs.rs/releases/queue
undefined says If you want to get a head start you can check out the `stylus-sdk-rs` repo locally and run `cargo doc` 🙂
undefined says so what's the diff between `self.balances.get(address)` and using `setter() + .get()` ? if they are the same, what's the reason between ur decision to use setter() + .get() ?
undefined says Great point!
undefined says okay make sense will stop asking for now and check doc later 😄
undefined says We re-use the setter to do `.get` and then `.set`. We could have split that
undefined says Oh actually it also lets you hold the same storage slot instead of hashing twice
undefined says So it's a minor performance optimization too that nets around 30 gas
undefined says Just to be clear though, we're going to rework this so that it's more straightforward 🙂
undefined says Thanks for bearing with us!
undefined says for constructor, should I just do `pub fn new...` under `#[external] impl....` ?
undefined says That's def a way to do it, though just be careful you're the first one to call the method. Otherwise someone else might initialize your contract
undefined says We recommend deploying and calling it in the same tx
undefined says Though testnet's not so adversarial -- you're safe to just call the thing in a follow-up tx haha
undefined says I did

```
    pub fn new(initialOwner: Address) -> Self {
        Self { owner: initialOwner }
    }
```

getting the error

```
71 |         Self { owner: initialOwner }
   |                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `StorageAddress`, found `Address`
```

Anyone know how to fix it?
undefined says @Haythem try to use stylus_sdk::storage::StorageAddress
undefined says pub fn new(initialOwner: StorageAddress) -> Self {
        Self { owner: initialOwner }
    }
undefined says getting this now
```
the trait `AbiType` is not implemented for `StorageAddress`
```
undefined says ah so it seems like it must be an `Address` type instead...thanks for checking ill look into this in a few minutes
undefined says https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1kvJpmyRRBXxE?s=20
undefined says You should use an Alloy Address instead of a storage type or any other address

undefined says @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs I get the same issue as Haythem using the alloy primitive address
undefined says https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwxWwXXldmxQ
undefined says That’s not really the intended use case for storage variables. In our model you declare your contract’s storage, and then have access to it in the entrypoint.

If you do want to declare storage yourself, you can use the `unsafe` `StorageAddress::new()` method, likely on the input 0,0
undefined says I did git pull to get latest repo version, and now I'm getting this error when doing stylus check
`Stylus checks failed: failed to build project to WASM: could not read release dir: No such file or directory (os error 2)`
undefined says @Haythem are you in the top level folder of your rust project?
undefined says lol was running the command from outside the project 😅  thnx
undefined says I'm trying to write the Ownable contract in rust https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/pull/41/files and still can't fix 
```
expected `StorageAddress`, found `Address`
```
undefined says You know @Haythem we have a Stylus hackathon in ETH NY where we're giving out 20k in bounties -- if you find this fun that could be a fun experience
undefined says That's next month
undefined says Also we're going to release additional tutorials, YouTube videos, etc 🙂
undefined says niice
undefined says @Haythem you shouldn't provide a constructor for Ownable, the StorageType derive already provides an unsafe one that will automatically be used if the Ownable is a field in another contract
undefined says Aha make sense
undefined says What's the best way to compare `msg::sender() != self.owner`, getting 
```
^^ no implementation for `stylus_sdk::alloy_primitives::Address == StorageAddress`
``` 😅
undefined says Can you do
```rs
msg::sender() != *self.owner
```
undefined says Or
```rs
msg::sender() != self.owner.get()
```
undefined says great, thnx
undefined says Looks like I fixed all issues, only this last one
```
Stylus checks failed: program predeployment check failed when checking against ARB_WASM_ADDRESS 0000000000000000000000000000000000000071: (code: -32000, message: program activation failed: failed to parse program

Caused by:
    missing import memory_grow
```
undefined says Oh wow, would you mind sharing your program?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/pull/41
undefined says We'll improve this error message, but what's really happening here is that there's no entrypoint, so it's not deployable on chain 🙂
undefined says Your code looks like a library, which other people might import to use in their contracts. That's awesome and very powerful, but in order for your code to be used on chain by itself, it'll need to instead have an `#[entrypoint]` somewhere
undefined says So what you could do is add a `main.rs` file, import your file, and then add an entrypoint that uses the Ownable mechanism you've implemented
undefined says Does that make sense?
undefined says :sayori:
undefined says Notice how the `erc20.rs` example has a corresponding `main.rs`, which declares a type that then uses `#[entrypoint]` and `#[inherit]` to use the `Erc20`
undefined says Ah yeah, make sense, thnx
undefined says https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1697334728331055555?s=20
undefined says hey everyone, are there any code examples of how i can deploy a contract using `RawDeploy`?
undefined says hey @Alec1017 we're working to improve in-contract deployment on the SDK, but for now, there is an example on the stylus repo for `RawDeploy`: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/stylus/arbitrator/stylus/tests/create/src/main.rs
undefined says what is activation transaction?
undefined says is there a Solidity abi export tool for other languages such as C?
undefined says Hello!
undefined says Is there a way to do something similar to a fallback function in Solidity? I see you can have a free function that accepts a `Vec<u8>` be an entrypoint but I don't see anything about how you'd structure things such that you can access the storage without defining the layout manually.
undefined says I added `#[entrypoint]` to ownable.rs https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/blob/bc61955798fa47daaf6c5618d6cb553f8d16897b/examples/ownable/src/ownable.rs#L11

and it works, Is that how it should be done if I want to write a contract that other will import(similar to OpenZeppelin Ownable in solidity) ?
undefined says If you define a sol_storage! or #[solidity_storage] struct as normal you can create it in your custom entrypoint using the unsafe constructor. I'm on my phone but look at the StorageType trait, or try looking at the `cargo expand` of an autogenerated entrypoint.
undefined says Sweet. I'll look into that. Appreciate it.
undefined says What's the best way to do a factory-style pattern in stylus? Is there anything like `type(C).creationCode`?
undefined says how do I test run the example of siphash in https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c?
undefined says can build dex in stylus?
undefined says I think `sol_interface!` is broken with no arguments
```
sol_interface! {
    interface A {
        function B() view returns (address);
    }
}
error: expected type, found `,`

undefined says I'm asking this out of curiosity, in theory would it be possible to use Noir in stylus? it's the rust based zksnark proving systems.
undefined says Hi! I was really interested in how you are creating the bindings between stylus and various target languages? Right now, the number of solid binding generators is... really weak...
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Yes defiinitely!
undefined says Not familiar with Noir, but if it is pure Rust code that can compile to WASM then it is likely 🙂
undefined says hi Zk, ill put an example together for you today, but you can also try out sha256:
undefined says thanks so much for the PR cheb, we'll be looking into it today
undefined says @mcbk28
undefined says Are you there @mcbk28
undefined says Please use #💬︱general ser
undefined says Thanks, but how to do test? like how should I write Solidity abi based on the example code given? or how to test it locally?
undefined says We plan to ship `v0.2.0` today, which should include a fix for this among other improvements!
undefined says Deploying Stylus programs to the testnet is a two-step process. You must first deploy your raw, compressed WASM code onchain. Then, you will need to send a follow-up tx that "activates" that WASM code. This activation process will compile the wasm code into a form that can be executed by our runtime. The nice thing is that if two people deployed the same code to different addresses, only one activation is necessary
undefined says Our `cargo stylus` tool does all this for you when you do `cargo stylus deploy` 🙂
undefined says Solidity ABI exports for our C sdk are not yet supported, but are totally doable in the future. At this time, if you want to use the siphash example, you will probably just have to send raw bytes via an eth_call to the siphash contract deployed onchain. The raw bytes start with a 16 byte key, followed by the input bytes you want to hash
undefined says ill put together an example of how to interact with the siphash contract in Rust using ethers-rs to talk to the Stylus testnet
undefined says @Zk , Rachel has also suggested that you could just include siphash in your C contracts that you want to deploy, as it is only 609 bytes so there is no size concern. However, if you want to just deploy siphash and call it, you would need to do it the way I mentioned above
undefined says Siphash is super small -- I'd just include it in your dapp directly. There's no need to introduce the overhead of calling out to another contract for something so tiny
undefined says reading through stylus (had a few questions). is the right way to think about it that the rust wasm can read/write storage slots? how does the wasm side handle memory expansion? what happens to the call trace for stylus smart contract calls? does the wasm have a way to get transpiled into MIPs to generate fraud proofs?
undefined says I see, let me test out some custom code using eth_call and see how's it going
undefined says > is the right way to think about it that the rust wasm can read/write storage slots? 

that's part of it, yes; the Rust wasm is accessing the equivalent storage slots that a Solidity contract would be accessing on the EVM. both Solidity contracts and Rust wasm contracts share the same state trie
undefined says The WASM the Rust is compiled to is fraud proven directly, rather similar to how we prove fraud over geth 🙂
undefined says re: memory expansion, the wasm expands memory one page at a time (64 KB pages); there is a separate pricing model for the wasm vm but I don't think we have it documented yet
undefined says nice that's helpful thanks!
undefined says Can I get the link of stylus testnet ?
undefined says does arbitrum light client isnot have？
undefined says https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/AbEZm9694_wCk1PnReoXuA this article is my writing.
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/testnet-information
undefined says no worries!
undefined says sweet
undefined says where can i find the vm specification?
undefined says hi @jtriley the runtime we use is https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer with some modifications,
undefined says but if you want to learn about the actual execution environment of the WASM code, would recommend looking into wasmer itself
undefined says sweet, ty. where can i find the diffs?
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/wasmer this is our fork
undefined says what about `"vm_hooks"`? i'm seeing it in tests as an import, but i'm not seeing much about it. it seems to expose an evm-like interface, but is it something i need to install to compile a wat or assemblyscript file?
undefined says Hi @jtriley these are imports that are provided to stylus wasm programs. For example, some of then allow you to grow memory, or read input args, or write output data to a caller. These are quite low level details we have yet to document
undefined says For example, heres how I added support for the zig programming language using these imports https://github.com/rauljordan/zig-on-stylus/blob/main/src/lib.zig
undefined says Ill share a tutorial on how to add new languages soon, hopefully next week
undefined says These imports will be injected into your program by our wasm runtime
undefined says @jtriley curious, so are you working on trying to get AssemblyScript working with Stylus?
undefined says no, just wat; wanna get a gas diff between wat and rs
undefined says but also i'm trying to work out what the hooks are doing under the hood & whether they're 'injected' as in they're where stylus diverges from wasmer or if it's a higher level of abstraction over the vm
undefined says sorry for missing this earlier; we don't have light clients in the real sense of the word, but you can run a node locally: https://docs.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-full-node also see the dev node section if you need a dev node. However, note that we don't yet have a docker image for Stylus
undefined says We don't modify wasmer, but rather escape the wasm client to native execution in the host via special imports
undefined says That's why they're called Host I/Os
undefined says You leave wasm execution, and jump into the VM
undefined says makes sense. ty for your help 🫡
undefined says Hey all, we just rolled out our first hot-fix to the Stylus testnet. We've reorged the chain in response to an issue around how we handled WASMs without memories. Here's the PR
- https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/pull/141

As a reminder the Stylus testnet and SDKs are in alpha, and so reorgs and regenesis are expected until Stylus approaches mainnet readiness.
undefined says :air: 
Btw we've just rolled out a new version of `cargo stylus` that has better error messages. You can upgrade your tooling via
```sh
cargo install --force cargo-stylus
```
undefined says We'll soon release v0.2.0 of the Rust SDK too based on feedback from users
undefined says 😐 maybe i need talk more content, here talking about light client is ibc protocol light client . So I want to learn about Arbitrum about consensus and client state more information. Here’s is ics02 client specs https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/core/ics-002-client-semantics/README.md I am also happy implement ibc protocol on arbtrium by stylus🧐🧐🧐
undefined says Hey guys, we've just released the newest version of the Stylus SDK after incorperating feedback from users.

You can upgrade to `0.2.0` by updating your `Cargo.toml` like so
```toml
stylus-sdk = "0.2.0"
```
Check out the release notes here!
https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/releases/tag/v0.2.0
undefined says Would love to hear your thoughts on wasmer vs wasmtime.
undefined says I'm trying the `stylus quick start` to deploy a contract but even that i have 0.5 eth in `Arbitrum Sepolia` it says `gas required exceeds allowance`.
I've tried the new one `cargo-stylus stylus deploy` and here the message tells me that my address is `has 0 balance onchain` even that is see in `sepolia-explorer.arbitrum.io/` that i have 0.5 eth.
What might i get wrong?
undefined says Ok, no i got it that there is stylus testnet
undefined says all good now!
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/

Is this the real link of stylus testnet ?
undefined says а где активность провести можно с новой сетью?
undefined says https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
undefined says Can I get the link of stylus testnet ?
undefined says There is a thread for this
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/testnet-information
undefined says Note that if ur bridging from sepolia to ard sepo it will take 15min after confirmation 
same as the bridging from arb sepo to stylus so give it time
undefined says why I can`t claim my ETH on L1? If I try to switch network to L1, the claiming window closes. So, what is the problem?
undefined says Are there any stylus test tasks besides bridging to sylus testnet? If so, where are the testing docs located?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction
undefined says can we do any activities on stylus right now?
undefined says How did the stylus
undefined says work
undefined says Thanks
undefined says that is the official bridge yes; you can use that bridge to transfer Sepolia ETH from L2 testnet to the Stylus L3 testnet
undefined says if you have Sepolia ETH on L1 you can bridge that to Arbitrum Sepolia L2 and then bridge again to Stylus Testnet L3
undefined says you can do anything you can do on a normal Arbitrum chain plus build Rust or wasm-based smart contracts; right now it's just a testnet for alpha testing the chain as we go through audits and improve the SDK and dev experience
undefined says link doesnt work
undefined says oh man I  love arbitrum :arbheart:

undefined says https://developer.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/testnet-information
undefined says How do we use `U256` when we need to pass the value as Eth?
e.g.: `self.erc20.mint(msg::sender(), <<1 ether>>>);`  or something?
undefined says Everything is going well, starting from the bridge:
Sepolia > Arbitrum Sepolia
Arbitrum Sepolia > Stylus
However, the only thing is that it takes more time than expected.
undefined says Right now you’ll need to multiply by the number of wei per ether (1 billion). In the future we’ll provide nice constants
undefined says Can Stylus be used with for example C#? Perhaps with converter to C?
undefined says Finally got it. Here's how i managed to pass 10 eth:
```
let amount = U256:: from(10*((10u64).pow(18)));
```
undefined says @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs i got error sir
undefined says while using "cargo stylus check" command
undefined says Sooon
undefined says Stylus smooth using easy to use
undefined says Does stylus only support rust languages so far? I checked the docs and there doesn't seem to be a guide for c/c++...
undefined says Hey! We have an example for C/C++ here => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c
undefined says Oh i miss these page, thx!
undefined says how do u guys test your Stylus contracts?
undefined says you can intreact by ethers
undefined says https://github.com/All-In-One-Blockchain/hello-world maybe you can look this.
undefined says I think we can use all ethereum tools .
undefined says boy i wish i knew more about coding. i deployed a token with thirdweb and used remix to drop a simple contract. are there any other sites for contract dummies like me to deploy contracts. also finalizing the contract always messes with my mind.
undefined says hi,What tests are needed? Is it only possible to do bridge testing now?
undefined says i am a C dev and very happy to see that now i will be able to write contracts in C. I can understand VM_HOOK macro as an entrypoint but nok the CONSOLE one. Where it gonna print out the given param ?
undefined says I am rust
undefined says Dev
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/groot-i-am-groot-cute-gotg-gif-15564811
undefined says Gm! Is there a timeline for when Stylus support will go live on Arbitrum One?
undefined says Even a rough idea?
undefined says It needs to be voted on by the DAO, first.  It's probably a quarter or two away.
undefined says You should generally consider debug-mode to be disabled and, accordingly, CONSOLE macros to be invalid.
Debug mode can be used on a local stand-alone dev node, as part of the chain-config. Prints will be done to the log output of that node.
undefined says Already checking - great idea 🙂
undefined says C# is difficult to use due to the size of the binaries and it's currently difficult to do garbage-collected languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, etc
undefined says C can of course work, but I'd probably recommend using just straight C as the C# converter will likely produce bloated code
undefined says > Please come back in 12 hours.

undefined says here's the contract address: `0xe41104A38C35B464FcFebf85cf274760Ea120d02`

here's the source:
https://gist.github.com/jtriley-eth/8531b5f19769ed3a4777d066544d76b9

it exposes the following abi:
```solidity
function hash() view returns (bytes32)
function keccakLoop(string calldata str, uint256 iterations)
```

but it's reverting on a staticcall to `hash()`
undefined says Are there any plans for local testing environments?
undefined says ^^
undefined says I've deployed a Rust token on Stylus: 
https://rust-tokens.vercel.app/
undefined says Please let me know what you think and if you have any method to compare gas consumption between Rust & Solidity tokens:
https://twitter.com/Jumaru_Igano/status/1699317829751759015
undefined says minted 10 R20T
undefined says and 10 S20T
undefined says You can mint also 10 S20T, the equivalent in Solidity.
I'm looking for a way to compare gas consumption among those two implementations
undefined says The stylus testnet is for builders only right and not for public
undefined says minted 10 R20T and 10 S20T   👍
undefined says It would be great to know plans on this 👍
undefined says Hello! Where I can get test token ?
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/testnet-information#faucets
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Always glad to help 💪
undefined says So Stylus is only working on the testnet right? Is there any information when it will come to mainnet?
undefined says Hey, does `--export-abi` support generating JSON ABI?
undefined says Not yet, you’ll need another tool like Solc that converts a Solidity interface into a JSON ABI.
undefined says We’re working on it 🙂
undefined says Stylus needs an audit and a DAO vote for L2 — but on L3 you can use it today. In fact, the Stylus testnet is an Orbit chain!

Note though that Stylus is in alpha and needs to complete an audit before we’d suggest people use it in production
undefined says Yes, I thought so. I've managed to interact with a WASM-deployed contract using JS and the experience is the same as a normal Solidity contract. Kudos!
undefined says We're thinking about different approaches to make testing these programs easier, but for now, testnet is the only way
undefined says Why I can't Swap arb to stylus,?
undefined says Stylus is a testnet meant only to experiment new developments with it: https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction
undefined says so all i have to do is setup testnet to try whatever i want?
undefined says Testnet is ready. We have a quickstart available to try things out 🙂 => https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-quickstart
undefined says i have to send real eth to mainnet dev account?
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st
undefined says This is an L3 testnet on top of sepolia. To use it you only need sepolia eth that you can get from a faucet
undefined says i'm mining some eth
undefined says failing to install git, errors around:

(proc-macro2, libc, syn, typenum)
undefined says @Harry | Offchain Labs
undefined says @pitty76 | Will not PM u 1st let me know if not to ping you around this particularly
undefined says this is the first error
undefined says error: linking with `cc` failed: exit status: 1
undefined says No worries, I would actually reach out and tag @José FP | Offchain Labs or @Mahsa | Offchain Labs who seem to be on now.
undefined says When can see Stylus Mainnet
undefined says Thank you all for looking into this. 🙏🏻
undefined says To be announced, Still need to go through their audit. "Trails of Bits will be auditing the Stylus source code to ensure the safety of the contracts, as well as the Stylus SDKs." https://medium.com/offchainlabs/stylus-now-live-one-chain-many-languages-eee56ad7266d
undefined says success!!! i had to update xcode
undefined says Hey everyone! We've just rolled out version `0.2.1` of the Rust SDK. [Check it out here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/releases/tag/v0.2.1)!

To upgrade to the latest version, update your `Cargo.toml` like so
```toml
stylus-sdk = "0.2.1"
```
undefined says I'm deploying but somehow it says i hve a 0 balance, but i looking at arb sepolia .05 eth...
undefined says and .002 sepolia mainnet, whats the probelm
undefined says @Ricardo__Gordon | Arbitrum
undefined says Check your wallet on:

https://stylus-testnet-explorer.arbitrum.io/
and
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/

To see if everything is okay and which assets do you have.
undefined says I found the stylus testnet to send funds to on bridge.
undefined says Have you bridged your SepETH to Stylus?
undefined says that was the problem, I couldn't find that, but I got it and deployed
undefined says What should I do now ?
undefined says finished the quickstart, deployed a "program", an empty one i guess
undefined says So now do I program something to deploy again to this?
undefined says I see yes I can deploy multiple contracts awesome
undefined says [New Stylus SDK version!](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/releases/tag/v0.2.2)
undefined says @gzeon | Offchain Labs @davidb | Offchain Labs  please can you accept request
undefined says ?
undefined says I  will like to have a chat with you boss
undefined says I didn't see a DM request
undefined says Please check again
Friend request!
undefined says this is now( on pic) PENDING, check now.
undefined says I'm having difficulty bridging from Arb Sepolia to Stylus, it keep giving error

What to do pls
undefined says d m me the error you received
undefined says @Elsie
undefined says Done
undefined says hey, I see that `memory_grow` is called only in `mark_used`. Are there any calls of it under the hood by the Rust standard library that I am missing? Probably this is how the wasm grows its linear memory. 
I was wondering since it is only called in `mark_used`. If that's the case, what is the idea behind having them both imported and exported in the first place?
undefined says Issue solved, I only change my browser
undefined says Left me hanging
undefined says `memory_grow` is the function that makes you pay to invoke the `memory.grow` WASM opcode. Any WASM that intends to grow must import the function in the Stylus VM
undefined says `mark_used` exists solely to force the Rust compiler to import the symbol. A similar trick is done in the C/C++ SDK to force its import as well
undefined says :air:
undefined says [A new version of the SDK is out btw!](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/releases)
You can import it by updating your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
stylus-sdk = "0.2.4"
```
undefined says You may need to update Rust for this version. You can do this via
```sh
rustup upgrade
cargo install --force cargo-stylus
```
undefined says do not ask for dms, please; please disregard in future @Elsie better for everyone to keep convo here and be cautious about any DMs you receive (never share private info)
undefined says Thanks, is `memory_grow` expected to be called manually?
undefined says Alright
undefined says No, your language’s compiler will generate `memory.grow` opcodes for you
undefined says If you call it manually, it’ll just burn gas without actually growing the memory
undefined says For the EthGlobal NY bounty, is it possible to submit and win the bounty remotely? Our team is planning to implement a zkVM in WASM on Stylus.
undefined says Will stylus be integrated with the rest of Arbitrum network or is it planned to be standalone network?
undefined says it is up to the DAO to vote on Stylus integration with One and Nova; it will definitely be available for Orbit chains (L3s), but it will take a couple months to go through audits
undefined says I'm sure that the community will support it. It's a great advantage and unique feature 💪
undefined says I checked on this and unfortunately there won't be a remote bounty available; you'll have to physically be in NY at least at the beginning, for it. There may be future ETHGlobal remote versions that we or the DAO participate in. In the meantime, we'd love to see zkVM projects on Stylus, and I think the idea is certainly valuable enough on its own to proceed without a bounty, please do!
undefined says and if you build something cool, let us know and we'll connect you with our partnerships team
undefined says Is it just a bridge from Sepolia ARB to Sepolia Stylus and from Sepolia Stylus to Sepolia ARB, sir?
undefined says Hey, I read an interesting concept for Arbitrum Stylus. I want to help the project using my skills, I would like to install a node. As far as I understand correctly, this is a test version and any community member can do this.
undefined says We'll have a guide + docker image for setting up a node soon. Right now you'll want to use the public testnet, which is the default RPC of the `cargo stylus` tool
undefined says ok, Thanks.
undefined says And I also wanted to ask a few things. Now there will be Devnet, then testnet and at the end mainet, right?
undefined says There’s a testnet right now 🙂
undefined says Eventually, if the DAO approves, Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova will upgrade to Stylus
undefined says @Rachel 💙 | Offchain Labs we understand there is a size limit for the stylus wasm program. It turns out our program is much larger than this limit—about 1024KB. My question is: will this limit be lifted in the future? If not, it seems our only option is to make our program as a pre-compile and run it in our Orbit chain?
undefined says Stylus is undergoing major upgrades, and some improvements are expected to require a chain reset.
undefined says Excuse me，will the cross-chain bridge eth to stylus be reset now?
undefined says Stylus is testnet only right now and sits on top of Arbitrum Sepolia. There’s no ETH bridge that I’m aware of
undefined says i mean,Arbitrum Sepolia to Stylus testnet
undefined says Yes, we’re working on binary sizes in a few ways
- We’re improving the Rust SDK to make binaries smaller
- We’re adding more features to the C SDK, which produces much smaller binaries
- We’re working on increasing the contract size limit. It’s unclear yet if we’ll be able to allow contracts of that size (if we did, it’d be an unlimited policy where you’d pay more the larger the binary was)

For something so large, your options right now are to
- Create Orbit precompiles, which have no limit, allow SIMD and floating point, are lower fee, etc
- Split your code over multiple contracts / optimize your binary (probs not worth it given 1024Kb is pretty far away from the 128Kb limit)

Something I’m curious about is how compressible your contract is. I’m assuming that number is 1 megabyte before compression, but what is it after applying brotli 11?
undefined says Yes, if you don’t bridge out (takes 20 mins) you’ll lose your testnet ether. We’ll give everyone a heads up when we schedule upgrades
undefined says thanks
undefined says thnks
undefined says minted 10 R20T and 10 S20T   👍
undefined says not yet
undefined says Bridge worked without any issues
undefined says how to do that? there is no clear activities
undefined says same issue sir, i tried different browser, brave, chrome, firefox, even mobile
undefined says when i change back to arbitrum sepolia when claiming eth, it disappears, but when i change to stylus, its there
undefined says I did the quickstart but Its showing like 44 problems, are they supposed to be there for me to fix or what? because its not a quickstart if this is the case, 

note: just getting into programming, its all the same to me whats easy is difficult whats hard is difficult, getting used to vscode, lots to read, but I need an interaction from somebody here please.
undefined says @Samuel | Arbitrum sir
undefined says Excuse me, when will the eth on Stylus testnet no longer be lost?Is there an exact time or announcement?
undefined says I have two questions about stylus & precompile- How shall I do 'precompile' with go? Is there documentation or code demonstration (like stylus-hello-world)? 

Since my wasm package is too large to be implemented with stylus(with the warning: Stylus checks failed: failed to build project to WASM: uncompressed WASM program size (1.1 MB) is bigger than size limit: (128.0 KB)), I want to run wasm code in go as prerecompile. Is that possible? What should i do?
undefined says Bridge out from Stylus, right? Thank you.
undefined says the bridge did't work all day impossible to claim back the arb sepholia send from arb stylus . when i change the network the trasaction from arb stylus gone and i can see the transaction from sepholia only .
undefined says Maybe update your Rust version
`rustup update`
undefined says heloo guys i sent 2 test eth from stylus  to  arbitrum spoila from 6 hours and i didnt get it yet why  ? its too late right or theres somthing wrong ?
undefined says Hey guys! There's a new version of the Stylus SDK you can [check out here](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/releases)!

To adopt the latest version, edit your `Cargo.toml` as follows
```toml
stylus-sdk = "0.3.0"
```
undefined says Hi all, our first developer tutorial is out for Stylus here https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs/status/1701695008251015535?s=20
undefined says In this example, we go through rewriting a Counter.sol Solidity contract in Rust using Arbitrum Stylus, which results in the same, EVM-equivalent ABI that can be called using any Ethereum tooling
undefined says Let us know if you have any questions 🦀
undefined says checking it out!
undefined says Just a gentle reminder that Stylus will be featured at the ETH Global NY Hackathon Sep 22-24.  There are $20,000 in Stylus prize bounties available.  You can register at https://ethglobal.com/events/newyork2023/apply
undefined says Do we need to be physically in NYC to apply for this bounty?
undefined says Yep, you have to be at the hackathon in person to participate unfortunately. If you're interested, but can't attend this one, I'm sure there will be other hackathons coming in the future
undefined says Hey guys. Does someone already have a project in mainnet, that have been built using stylus rust sdk and rust in common?
undefined says can someone please give steps on how to build the siphash example in C?
undefined says using gcc?
undefined says Hey! We don't have instructions for using gcc, but there are instructions using clang here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c/blob/689d977564d5454fb17f83e2294a9a351c13392e/examples/siphash/main.c#L5
undefined says Check out Raul's Getting Started video on Stylus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1hLTGnByM&t=1s
undefined says I’m going to do the quickstart over again. 
It’s easy to mess things up in programming lol new to it but the passion is there 

Just watched your talk, loving the arbitrum YouTube, I feel content storm coming real soon.
undefined says Is some there arbitrum contract devs, I need help, much appriciate if you will try to figure out my issue?
undefined says Hey. Write down you issue here and our engineers will try to help you when they're available.
undefined says i think there may need to be more setup isntructions, seem to be stuck on  that

undefined says I have an issue, so I was trying to call sendL1FundedContractTransaction through the etherscan and I'm expecting the transaction to be executed at arbitrum but fo some reason it does not.
my tx hash is 0xe483cbd978aada9b2bc33bd0dbce5087d5a0aeb241fcd23f866e20ad8b0a84f1 and I'm trying to call 0x47ec4768502ada411bce8b973a6609f3f96061f3, is it possible to do such transaction ? Actually I'm not quite sure what sendL1FundedContractTransaction does since it does not described at docs.
undefined says Thank you! 🙂 will pin it now!
undefined says Pinned a message.
undefined says **Gmgm! Here is a new video tutorial to learn more about Stylus**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF1hLTGnByM&t=1s**
undefined says Pinned a message.
undefined says Stylus is still on testnet so there aren't mainnet contracts deployed, but there's a good example erc-20 implementation here https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/tree/stylus/examples/erc20
undefined says Hey!  Looks like you don't have ldd installed. You can find instructions here for ubuntu https://installati.one/install-lld-ubuntu-22-04/
undefined says I am looking at stylus, as a C/C++ dev. The site mentions C/C++ but looks like only Rust has an SDK?  Are there any examples with C++?  Or is it yet to come down the road?  thanks!
undefined says The C/C++ SDK is here 🙂
undefined says https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c
undefined says Got it, thanks! Will take a look, and build something to try it out!
undefined says Will stylus come to Nova as well?
undefined says Kindly refer to this https://discord.com/channels/585084330037084172/1146789176939909251/1150229757443702876

undefined says Hey everyone, just wanted to let the group know that some new Stylus docs went live today that could be useful if you're interested in gas optimization 🙂 

1. An overview of Gas and Ink in Stylus: https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/concepts/stylus-gas

2. Opcode and host I/O pricing tables: https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/opcode-hostio-pricing
undefined says Stylus smart contract verification not up yet?  https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/154555/how-to-verify-a-stylus-smart-contract
undefined says Stylus
undefined says Hi @Patrick Collins not at the moment but we’re actively thinking about reproducible build / verification solutions
undefined says Thanks for trying this out! Let us know if you have any other questions
undefined says I will 🙂
undefined says Btw, devrel tip - I highly encourage people to post questions on a forum like Peeranha / Ethereum Stack Exchange. 

For the following reasons:
1. The questions will be indexed by web crawlers so that they show in web search results (discord does not)
2. AIs that train on stack exchange will learn from the Q&A of such forums, meaning people who use AIs can then have better conversations

I have created a `stylus` tag on Stack Exchange ETH if anyone is interested in following it so that other devs can find the answers and be better for it 🙂
undefined says I have another stylus question if anyone can help me out!

I can't seem to understand why I need to use `extern crate alloc` vs just `use std::alloc`. Using the latter, my miniaml smart contract code does not compile.

I get this error

```bash
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: could not find `vec` in `alloc`
  --> src/main.rs:20:5
   |
20 |     #[entrypoint]
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ could not find `vec` in `alloc`
```

The full context can be found here:
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/154566/why-do-i-use-extern-crate-for-alloc-instead-of-use-stdalloc
undefined says Got another question if anyone knows!

Hard to try this stylus stuff with so few examples of what a full codebase looks like! 

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/154568/how-to-make-a-struct-in-sol-storage-layout-in-stylus
undefined says Thanks for making a Stylus tag 😄

I’m on mobile rn so I’ll answer this one here for now, but for the storage definition you can do 
```RA
sol_storage! {
    pub struct Contract {
         Person[] list_of_people;
    }

    pub struct Person {
        uint256 favorite_number;
        string name;
    }
}
```
undefined says I’ll look into this when I get back to my computer, but it’s probably because the Stylus SDK is `#[no_std]` and we should tweak the macro for users who opt-in to the standard library
undefined says Guys, I am new into blockchain development. I am very happy about Arbitrum Stylus, since it will allows to develop smart contract in rust. I am trying to learn how to interact with this chain. The first thing that I want to do is to automate the interaction with the Arbitrum bridge to transfer ETH from Ethereum Sepolia to Arbitrum Sepolia to Arbitrum Stylus, to understand how this bridge works. Then I will try to develop smat contracts for Stylus. Can you tell me what are the steps for doing these bridges or share a tutorial? I already know how to develop smart contract with solidity for Ethereum testnets
undefined says Thanks! This put me on the right path I think... But now I'm having an issue pushing new stuff to my array... playing with it now...
undefined says Yeah I think this is the answer, but I couldn't figure out where the `no_std` section was. 

We have this line:

```
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "export-abi"), no_main)]
```

but I wasn't able to figure out if that *also* meant `no_std` somehow.
undefined says I'm just going to ignore structs for now...
undefined says https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/154586/how-to-make-a-test-in-stylus
undefined says Probably my most important question!! ^ How do I write a test?
undefined says (Sorry for the spam here, got a sunday to myself and am trying to get my learn on!)
undefined says Popped off a bit on the q's. Hopefully this will be helpful for other devs who run into this stuff. 

I tried to ChatGPT them as much as possible ahah.

undefined says Hey everyone, [a new version of the Stylus SDK is out](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs/releases)!

To upgrade to the latest version, edit your `Cargo.toml` as follows
```toml
stylus-sdk = "0.4.1"
```
undefined says How can we enable reentrant for stylus?
undefined says Feature flag
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#reentrancy
undefined says It’s indeed a feature flag
```toml
stylus-sdk = { version = “0.4.1”, features = [“reentrant”] }
```
undefined says There’s other flags too!
undefined says Btw introducing reentrancy with the default feature flags on will change the API a bit, since you have to be careful to flush the storage cache when making calls, among other safety considerations.

Some users may prefer to only opt into the features they want, which you can do via
```toml
stylus-sdk = { version = “0.4.1”, no-default-features = true, features = [“reentrant”] }
```
undefined says It would be better not going the Sui/Aptos route. They require a local build and a command line to ensure the code on chain corresponds to some source. Browser based would be better imo
undefined says :Stylus: :Stylus: :Stylus:
undefined says Yas .stylus
undefined says If any of y’all are participating in the ETH NY hackathon, here’s some project ideas if you’re still thinking about what you want to build!
undefined says https://x.com/cryptoiscute/status/1703935593263308918?s=46
undefined says Hey all, by popular demand, setting up a local dev node with Stylus enabled has been made easy, with instructions added to the docs!

https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/local-stylus-dev-node
undefined says admin, may i suggest to add a choices for this pop up modal notif , make it for approved for 5,30 mins or 1hr while online
undefined says great one
undefined says Hey, does Arbitrum Stylus have a live bug bounty? If not, when can we expect one?
undefined says Quick question to devs? Is arbitrum stylus mulithreaded like solana's execution env or does it still run single threaded? Another thing is can geth run multithreaded, even if it's complied to wasm?
undefined says is there a way to run wasm's > 128KB on a local chain (for testing)?
undefined says ```uncompressed WASM program size (190.2 KB)
```
trying:

```
cargo +nightly build -Z build-std=std,panic_abort -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort
```
&&
```
wasm-opt --enable-nontrapping-float-to-int --enable-typed-function-references --enable-gc --enable-reference-types --enable-exception-handling  --inline-functions-with-loops --traps-never-happen --fast-math
```
undefined says Yes, we're working on increasing limits for an upcomming upgrade, but for now what you can do is edit the following two lines in the node software

https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/fc0a69d9a9e9fecfa7ae7ed028d16fc84b4ee62a/arbos/programs/programs.go#L63

undefined says Feel free to change those to whatever you like -- we're working on a model where larger contracts are possible.
undefined says Hey all, new doc for optimizing the binary size for your WASM programs just dropped!

https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/optimizing-binaries
undefined says I'd expect there will be a live bounty before stylus is deployed on mainnet anywhere, but first it will have to be finalized and go through a full audit so that will take some time
undefined says Stylus currently only supports single threaded execution execution though multithreading could be explored as a possible future extension
undefined says so close
undefined says yet so far: 
```
uncompressed WASM program size (214.1 KB) is bigger than size limit: (128.0 KB)
```
https://github.com/maceip/tlsn-verify
undefined says great doc! The Kotlin/Jetbrains devs seem to know what they are doing with wasm, and here's their binaryen configs: https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/00fa09dbf3796554a583c7abe19838bbc48882f4/libraries/tools/kotlin-gradle-plugin/src/common/kotlin/org/jetbrains/kotlin/gradle/targets/js/binaryen/BinaryenExec.kt#L36

/me shakes fist
undefined says were you able to figure this out?

i'm trying to do a line-by-line uniswapv2 port to stylus, but also encountered this problem 

probably the best way now is to compile the solidity UniswapV2Pair contract first, then extract the init bytecode to put in stylus code as a constant?
undefined says Hi mac, I noticed youre reading from file which wont work in stylus. I would remove that and also try to avoid using the standard lib to help with size
undefined says And would remove all the printfs
undefined says Ah yeah I was just doing a quick test to see how big the wasm would  be
undefined says I'm actually not sure how that even compiles because wasm32-u-u is nostd
undefined says Maybe the compiler optimized out everything since I just return Ok() Everytime
undefined says I'll play with it today 🐸
undefined says :Stylus:
undefined says is the `endowment` argument in `RawDeploy::deploy()` just the eth value sent when deploying a contract? if so, why not just name it `value`?
undefined says `endowment` is what it’s technically called in EIPs for whatever reason, but yes it’s the initial balance of the smart contract
undefined says https://evm.codes
undefined says Got it, thanks for the explanation!
undefined says Where can I find examples of stylus_sdk::call::call usage. I couldn't find the information in the documents.
For example i have interface:
```rust
sol_interface! {
    interface IErc20 {
        function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
        // ...
    }
}
```
I want to call `transfer` function, but I only have the token address.
```rust
#[external]
impl SomeContract {
    pub fn some_action(&mut self, token: Address, amount: U256) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        let data = ...; // how do I encode call of `IErc20(token).transfer(msg::sender(), amount)`?
        call::call(self, token, data);
    }
}
```
undefined says hi @Defernus you can try something like:

let erc20 = IErc20::new(token);
let data = erc20.transfer(recipient, amount)
undefined says Hi everyone, we just published a guide on how to add support for new programming languages to Stylus, with Ziglang being newly added!
undefined says https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/how-tos/adding-support-for-new-languages walkthrough here
undefined says and we also have a repository here with a Zig smart contract that checks for prime numbers https://github.com/OffchainLabs/zig-on-stylus
undefined says The coolest part is that anyone can add new languages 🙂 not just our team
undefined says https://x.com/KAndrewHuang/status/1704848429883732256?s=20
undefined says Can't really get our code down below 120k -- and not sure if we want to spend time recompiling your fork of geth to increase the size
undefined says Do y'all know of other wasm / rust compatible evms
undefined says Or zkevms
undefined says Anyone from Offchain labs in NYC tonight?
undefined says We have a team of about 12 people in the city for ETH Global NYC hackathon starting this Fri - Sun
undefined says good project

undefined says running the test-node (eth-global branch), I can't get the cargo stylus cli to connect to my local stylus httprpc endpoint:
```
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-5:~/tlsn-verifier-onchain$ export RPC_URL=http://arbos.gossip.cash:8547
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-5:~/tlsn-verifier-onchain$ export ENV_RPC_URL=http://arbos.gossip.cash:8547
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-5:~/tlsn-verifier-onchain$ cargo stylus check
```
...
```
Uncompressed WASM size: 626.1 KB
Compressed WASM size to be deployed onchain: 185.8 KB
Connecting to Stylus RPC endpoint: https://stylus-testnet.arbitrum.io/rpc
Stylus checks failed: program predeployment check failed when checking against ARB_WASM_ADDRESS 0000000000000000000000000000000000000071: (code: -32000, message: failed decompression: 0, data: None)
```
undefined says ```
~/tlsn-verifier-onchain$ cat .env
PRIV_KEY_PATH="./key.txt"
RPC_URL=https://arbos.gossip.cash
ENV_RPC_URL=https://arbos.gossip.cash
```
undefined says You’ll need to change your endpoint to a local node built with the right docker image. Notice how in the logs the RPC you’re using shows up there, and it’s the testnet one
undefined says ```sh
cargo stylus check -e http://localhost:8545
```
undefined says Or whatever your local node is 🙂

undefined says is it possible to verify contracts on the explorer that were written in rust via stylus with a verify command?
undefined says btw great project having fun playing around so far
undefined says Stylus New news
undefined says can someone show me how to do example of a static call with alloy and look at estimated gas, etc? im a doofus with rust
undefined says Hey, I'm currently trying to use Stylus to deploy my rust file, and I need a private key file path to do it? Where do I get that from and what is it supposed to look like?
undefined says Got one Yh?
undefined says I figured it out, dw thanks boss
undefined says Okay mate , can I private text you
undefined says You may have figured it out by now, but I recommend reading [this reference](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/reference/rust-sdk-guide#calls) to learn how to make calls in the SDK 🙂
