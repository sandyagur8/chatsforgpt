undefined says Hey everyone, some exciting announcements!  cLabs is excited to announce the release of ContractKit v1, the newest version of our SDK. Read more about it here: https://medium.com/celoorg/contractkit-1-0-0-9c0412462d45 

We also created a migration guide to make the transition from v0 to v1 easier! https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit/migrating-to-contractkit-v1

Finally, we released CLI 1.0.1 to use this updated SDK and also have some added functionality. Read the release notes here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celocli-v1.0.1

Thanks for being a part of the Celo Developer ecosystem 🎉
undefined says CLI v1.0.2 was just released. You can download it using `npm install -g @celo/celocli@1.0.2` & you can find release notes here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celocli-v1.0.2
undefined says CLI v1.0.3 was just released. You can download it using `npm install -g @celo/celocli@1.0.3` & you can find release notes here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celocli-v1.0.3

undefined says CLI v1.2.0 was just released. You can download it using `npm install -g @celo/celocli@1.2.0` . You can find release notes here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celocli-v1.2.0

SDK v1.2.0 was also released. All the packages. You can find release notes here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/contractkit-v1.2.0
Note: the `@celo/utils` and `@celo/base` were required to be redeployed again (both in version `1.2.1`, due to having a different version of web3 (we are using the 1.3.5), which was generating a big impact on the bundle size of the other packages because of dup libs. Both are already used by the sdk  `1.2.0` version, because now that we are properly using semantic versioning, we are not fixing the entire version to the packages anymore, and we are allowing bug updates.

undefined says **Introducing Celo Sage—Create, Earn, and Grow as a Content Creator In the Celo Community 🎓 🌱**

Many Web3 projects are not well-documented or have very few educational developer resources. Because of that, learning about—and building on—Web3 platforms can be very challenging compared to Web2. 

To ease that transition, meet Celo Sage—a community-driven program through which the community creates various types of content, including articles, tutorials, and videos to help developers onboard to the Celo ecosystem. In exchange for creating this content, contributors will receive token bounties. 

There is no limit on how much a contributor can earn. With this initiative, we hope to build a community of creators. Check out this post and join the celo-sage channel to learn more.

and my pull request has accepted
https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter/pull/12
But i'ven't received bounty reward yet, can you please check ?
undefined says hey thanks for flagging this. this was supposed to be paid, but obviously wasn't. I'll send it to you now
undefined says i've received it, many thanks
undefined says Can i create docker to improve this ?
undefined says i am open to it. how would you use docker to improve it?
undefined says I plan to do the following: 
1. Create dockerfile, docker-compose and load frontend (react-app) as a container service
2. Create Makefile to deploy contract & run docker frontend - it helps developer easily deploy quickly for their own services
undefined says do you think this would improve the existing experience? i am not sure that it is needed. it adds more overhead and doesn't make it that much easier. am i missing something?
undefined says oh okay, its may complicate for beginner user 😄
undefined says maybe we could add this as a new branch. as you mentioned, it might be useful for more advanced users
undefined says great, i will submit the PR soon
undefined says Hi @joshc , I've submitted PR https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter/pull/34
undefined says hey thanks! sorry for the delay on this. I was at the Celo conference last week
undefined says i will review this today
undefined says hello
undefined says Hello
undefined says Can I ask specific questions here for support trying to modify the app, or is it more for letting people know when I've made changes?

undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-progressive-dapp-starter/pull/39
undefined says Hello I am playing around with the celo progressive dapp starter and I'm adding WMATIC and WETH and I have used the Optics token. Is there a WBTC token that is also trustworthy to use? I am using Optics because I have used it many times and it always works. Thank you!
undefined says hello, please has anyone successfully used celo-contractkit with typescript. I'm getting some type error

undefined says Hey @joenyzio , No I am unable to do so for the 3 New PRs I submitted.
undefined says @joenyzio is it possible for someone to create many issue as in gitcoin for celo-composer for different contribution
undefined says 
undefined says Hey @joenyzio , New PR opened 😃 . Please review
https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/pull/115
undefined says @joenyzio New PR opened https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/pull/116
undefined says Samething here, I wasn’t able to open submission in Gitcoin
undefined says @joenyzio I just opened another PR https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/pull/117, this one I am particularly excited about because its a new start of the Gitbook powered docs, guides, videos, builds and challenge.
undefined says Its currently on https://alofe-oluwafemi.gitbook.io/celo-composer-docs/. The domain will have to change to Celo's own sub-domain, I am sure I will get help with that from  @Ernest Nnamdi (GMT +1) 😃 tomorrow for this
undefined says Hey @mujhtech @OluwafemiAlofe I chatted with the Gitcoin team and it looks like that's unfortunately not possible! Sorry for the confusion I hadn't realized this. I'll eventually try and sort things out using milestones but for now we can keep your initial submissions open longer term and payout additional bounties based off of the PRs. Hope this helps!
undefined says Wow very cool! I'd love to hear more about plans for this. sounds like you've been talking to @Ernest Nnamdi (GMT +1) already so I'll try and get caught up 🙂

undefined says I'll check this out today thanks!
undefined says Thanks
undefined says @joenyzio New Pr Opened https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/pull/121/
undefined says This is interesting
undefined says 
undefined says Hello,
I wanted to try out celo composer, but unfortunately, it crashes  on the very first step of installation process:
undefined says Hey I reproduced your steps and I got the same error. My work around was to edit the create.js file on line 7 changing

```
fs-extra
```
to just

```
fs
```
so change line 7 of create.js to:
```
const { ensureDir, readdir } = require("fs");
```
undefined says 
undefined says should become:
undefined says run
```
npx @celo/celo-composer create
```
again and you'll proceed to the next step
undefined says lastly a little info about it:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation do you know why I had to modify the code? if that is the case for everyone I can submit a PR to change the instructions on the ReadMe for Celo Composer.
undefined says Now when I select one of the next options I receive this error:
```
Unhandled exception. Shutting down TypeError: ensureDir is not a function
    at Command.createAsync (/Users/~/.npm/_npx/500f2d7f75beab14/node_modules/@celo/celo-composer/bin/create.js:58:11)

undefined says Which template are you using?
undefined says I downloaded it from GitHub yesterday

undefined says hi, 
I'm following this tutorial https://developers.celo.org/build-celo-dapps-in-15-minutes-or-less-438ea954d0b1
encountering errors, first of all in the repo https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer  this file -> .nvmrc <- is not present and the repo is updated while the tutorial looks older, can anyone give me an updated resource ? also the repo in "getting started" doesn't have any command to use to install
undefined says Post your error
undefined says If you run _yarn install_ and get an error 👇
undefined says error Workspaces can only be enabled in private projects. ❌
undefined says Add a new property to the _package.json_ file in the root folder 👉 add **"private": true**
undefined says in fact the file .nvmrc is not present in the repo
undefined says Hey this article is outdated. Celo composer now has a CLI that you can use to get started very easily. You can follow the steps in readme here - https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer
undefined says Thank you @Viral | Celo 


@vissequ it seems the problem has been solved.
undefined says Okay great.
undefined says thanks a lot
undefined says The DevRel team is already working on an update. Will be released soon
undefined says @Viral | Celo If you need help kindly state your issue
undefined says Hi team, I tried to start the react-app as per the instruction in the article, https://developers.celo.org/build-celo-dapps-in-15-minutes-or-less-438ea954d0b1
undefined says But I'm unable to access the localhost:3000 page, getting the following error
undefined says ``` pages/index.tsx (45:48) @ eval

  43 |     // address: contracts[contract].address,
  44 |     // To use Truffle, Uncomment the below line and comment the above line

  46 |   });
  47 | }
  48 | ```
undefined says I was able to successfully deploy the contracts though into Alfajores testnet and the address have been updated in hardhat/deployments/hardhat_contracts.json
undefined says But still facing the issue. Am i missing something?
undefined says cc: @joenyzio @Viral | Celo
undefined says hello again, already 3 days trying to fix this error, can't find solutions on google, anyone knows how to fix this? after doing "yarn install" (i added private true even if that's not the problem, also did cllean yarn cache) i get the error in the picture
undefined says Hey @kemal🥷.eth Are you using celo composer CLI?
undefined says This should not be a problem. Let me recreate this on my end.
undefined says hello, I think so i did `git clone https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer` , cd celo-composer/packages/hardhat --> yarn install --> get the error
undefined says Oh that's the old way of doing things. Try this - 
`npx @celo/celo-composer create`. 
Choose the packages you want.
undefined says I think this would solve your issue https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/941003424298856448/1038801682680782858
undefined says Do you have a link to the guide explaining this celo-composer CLI? Kindly post 🙏
undefined says Hey @azeezabidoye We can in the middle of making a docs for celo composer.
undefined says To get the desired framework starter kit, all you need is `npx @celo/celo-composer create`. But if you have any questions, you can ask here, and I am happy to answer. 
We will try to get the docs ready in a few days.
undefined says Good day @Viral | Celo I am new here and I am from LearnWeb3
undefined says There is a bounty that I have complete and I want to ask about something, if it is okay I would like to ping you
undefined says Hey @mosnyik.btc Sure.
undefined says Okay thanks
undefined says Hey guys using  the celo dApp composer when I try yarn install hardhat I get no lock file found.  Any ideas what could be cause
undefined says are you doing  `cd packages/hardhat` folder ?
undefined says Yeah
undefined says You just have to do npx @celo/celo-composer create
undefined says @Viral | Celo mentioned here
undefined says .
undefined says 
undefined says Hey guys I get these errors when trying run yarn install
undefined says i have a problem with celo composer, once run `npx @celo/celo-composer create ` and created my root project, I go to `packages/hardhat`  type `yarn install`  and get the error in the screenshot
undefined says I sow more people have this issue
undefined says I'm facing this error since 4 days, trying so desperately to build something for earn web 3 😭😭
undefined says is it possible to copy and paste the screenshot?
undefined says is it possible to copy and paste the screenshot?
undefined says @vissequ here you go, thanks in advance
undefined says @Viral | Celo Hey. I believe he's still having trouble with the new method. Can you take a look when you have time? Thank you!
undefined says Hello I am having issues with the step after installing yarn. The step mentions "Create a new account and print the account number and private key using hardhat create-account." I get this error and am wondering if the command is outdated or there is another command similar to it in order to create an account.
undefined says Let me check it for you early tomorrow morning.
undefined says It’s npx hardhat create-account
undefined says Make sure you are in the hardhat folder @jackiesafari
undefined says You should cd to packages/hardhat before running the command.
undefined says Alrighty so now that i'm in the hardhat folder yarn install doesnt seem to work. I get a set of errors  "Usage error: The nearest package directory.."
undefined says I get a new error now that i'm in hardhat. Yarn install is now giving me a lot of errors. Any tips? larger image in post above.
undefined says To get the desired framework starter kit, all you need is `npx @celo/celo-composer create`. But if you have any questions, you can ask here.
undefined says Inside the packages/hardhat folder 📁
undefined says Navigate to the hardhat folder and run npm install command. If there is any yarn.lock file remove it and delete the npm_modules folder.
undefined says finally, removing yarn.lock fixed all problems
undefined says really dumb question: I finished my prject for earnweb3, now I want to upload it to github but it doesn't let me because I obviously can't publish main branch. how can I create a personal github repo from celo composer with my edited contracts and scripts?
undefined says Ok so now im following the read me from the celo-composer create and am in the section of getting testnet funds and installing dependencies. I am in hard hat but again when I try to "yarn install" I get errors. I already deleted the yarn.lock and made a new lock file but still get an error. Also tried not having a yarn.lock at all. but yea any new ideas are appreciated.
undefined says Fork the repo and build your own project and push it
undefined says Have you tried removing the npm_modules folder? Remove it and the yarn.lock and reinstall.
undefined says hi, I have this line of code,  `require(msg.value >= amount * 0.1 ether, "You must pay at least 0.1 ETH per donut");` , I wanna change ether to celo, how do I do it?
undefined says You don’t need to change it. ether is used to denote the native token of the blockchain you’re working on in Solidity.
undefined says Thanks for clarifying so my contract should be alright
undefined says Yes. It will work fine, at least on every EVM-based blockchain.
undefined says Is there any other thing I can help you with?
undefined says No, I'm done with my earnweb3 submission, now waiting for the results, thanks a lot 🙏
undefined says Congratulations 🎉 

I would suggest you try CELO 201 on DACADE.org.
undefined says I wish you the best of luck @kemal🥷.eth
undefined says I'll check it out !
undefined says Thanks !
undefined says Congrats! 🙂
undefined says I think I already removed it. I tried looking for it and dont see it. But just to be on the safe side where would I find the npm_modules file?
undefined says You should see it inside the project/* folder. It's auto-generated whenever you run the npm install command.
undefined says in the same directory where you have your package.json file
undefined says @here Hey, for those having issues with Celo Composer react, I have made a short loom video that might help.
https://www.loom.com/share/261fdc404d544e4d8267d66999a3ab85
undefined says All the readme are updated as well. Let me know if you need any help or facing any issues.
undefined says I started from scratch again because npm install wasnt working. However now I'm having difficulties in the beginning and getting an error about "Too many arguments". I tried the method as in the loom and also the readme version and keep getting the same error.    I have tried the npm cache clean --force to see if that was the problem but nothing.
undefined says @jackiesafari And older version of `@celo/celo-composer` might have cached in your system. Can you try running `npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create` and check if it's working.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says I tried it but I keep getting the same error about fatal: Too many arguments. 🥲
undefined says 
undefined says Hey @jackiesafari The issue is with the project name, try giving a name without extra spaces.
undefined says We will get this issue fixed ASAP.

undefined says Awesome!
undefined says Can I get documentation or any blog on celo composer because I think in the website they are showing outdated one.
undefined says I want to build a dapp using celo-composer and I creating all the setup according to the instructions given in the GitHub repo of celo-composer but can you explain how to deploy smart contract now  @ELIO | IntoTheVerse  @0xKnight
undefined says @kemal🥷.eth  I am also getting same error while running npm install can you please help
undefined says remove yarn.lock and node modules folder then try again
undefined says Ok I will try
undefined says Inside hardhat folder there is no yarn.lock file @kemal🥷.eth
undefined says In the root folder
undefined says Ok
undefined says And should I  delete node_modules of root folder
undefined says try with only yarn.lock first then if doesn't work also node_modules
undefined says What is the command after deleting
undefined says Now should I go to hardhat folder and try npm install
undefined says yes same as before
undefined says Ok I will try
undefined says No @kemal🥷.eth  I am getting same error it will stuck while installing ganache should I delete node_nodules folder in root directory or inside hardhat folder
undefined says root folder I think
undefined says For you after deleting yarn.lock it worked
undefined says if you delete node_modules in hardhat folder then you'll have to reinstall all modules but you could try
undefined says yes
undefined says You are using yarn ??
undefined says yeah I used yarn install
undefined says Ok I will also try with yarn
undefined says What is the command to deploy smart contract using celo-composer ??
undefined says maybe npx hardhat deploy but check the guide I don't remember perfectly 😂
undefined says https://www.loom.com/share/261fdc404d544e4d8267d66999a3ab85 this should help you!
undefined says Thanks Kemal it worked
undefined says You're welcome
undefined says Hi friends, I'm having issue installing Celo composer. I had installed it before and it was fine. But now, whenever it got to @mui/icons-material it says there's trouble with your network. Even when my network is so strong.
undefined says Can you try cleaning your npm cache?
undefined says Done. But no difference
undefined says Remove lock files.
undefined says That means it'll start downloading all over again. I already spent 4GB installing and only for it to get stuck. Maybe I'll have to spend another 2GB again.
undefined says Let me try that
undefined says I'm sorry to hear that. Follow these steps:
1. Remove the npm_modules folder 
2. Remove all lock files
3. Rerun npm install
undefined says I am doing this from the project's root directory right?
undefined says Depends on your directory structure. The rule of thumb is to install from the directory with your package.json file.
undefined says Exactly. But according to Celo composer's structure as highlighted in the video, it says from the project's root directory because if run from the workspace, there will be 3 node_modules folders in one project.
undefined says I'll just try this method now
undefined says Ok. You can send a screenshot here.
undefined says Here is the structure. I've 3 workspaces under the packages. And the root directory is "restructured"
undefined says I get this error. What I did is this. When I couldn't install successfully, I removed @mui/icons-material from the package.json which reside inside the react-app workspace. And I run yarn. Then the first installation was done but didn't build well cos of nodegyp. So now I tried to run install the mui deps, and it throws same error I was trying to avoid.
undefined says Anytime I install Celo composer, I always get this error after the installation is trying to build. It's always from Node-gyp. I detest nodegyp with passion. Don't know how to remove it. Seems Celo composer use it under the hood.
undefined says cd react-app

Before you run npm install
undefined says Ok thanks
undefined says Welcome
undefined says Though It was stated in this video to stay in the root directory b4 running yarn install. 👆
undefined says Celo composer is really giving so much trouble. From previous chats I read, more people complain Similar issue. It's been over 15hours that I am unable to successfully install dependencies in any of the packages. I already spent over 7GB of data all wasted.

I also tried installing using wsl. The installation command for composer does not even create a project. The error is often can't find file name.

I suggest the the Celo devs look into it asap. It would be a big turn off if one spent a lot of time and can't event get the project set up.
undefined says We are sorry for the inconvenience. I have seen a lot of people who have been able to set up their projects successfully. Did you attempt the solution I provided above? If yes, you should join @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation during the developers' office hours program for assistance.
undefined says No I haven't. Before now, I have successfully set up Celo composer. But I need to set up a new project, and suddenly not working.
undefined says When is the office hour?
undefined says Ok. Try all the steps outlined above. 

And make sure your date and time are correct.
undefined says Ok. I'll try set up a new project folder. But then data is the issue but I'll try. Thanks for support.
undefined says Welcome, and let me know how it goes.
undefined says Ok
undefined says The fixes suggested by @iamoracle | Celo should solve the issue 👍
undefined says Thanks 🙏
undefined says I am trying to use command given to create the new project but it is throwing this error what should I do? I think issue is with creation of package.json
undefined says 
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation hey we haven't been able to figure this out. Do you have any ideas?
undefined says Try deleting your node modules and lock files and do a package install again.
undefined says It should create the package.json file here, right? 

Check this line in error:

```
error: failed to initialize sparse-checkout
cat: no such file or directory: packages/react-app/package.json
```

This command should be able to create the project right? That is what my understanding. There is some error in creating the package.json file from this command and that's why the error is happening.

I created whole new folder with all the files and files shown in the terminal including hidden files.
undefined says 
undefined says I don't know if this will help, and I know it will be a little annoying, but one option is to try creating a new user on your computer and reproducing the steps to see if you still have the same issue.
undefined says I can install new wsl this is Ubuntu 20.04(wsl) maybe I can install debian and try. Do you think that would be enough to test this?
undefined says I don't know to be honest. @Comm_Mod what do you guys think?
undefined says Worked.
undefined says Hmm okay. So it's probably with one of your installed modules or something I would think?
undefined says 
undefined says Yeah. I think so.
undefined says I'm off work right now was just checking in, but I think another one of our moderators should be able to help soon.
undefined says (Have to run for a few)
undefined says Figured out. Git version was outdated. When you said your installed modules, I just checked if issue is on this wsl settings and git version was 2.25 now it is 2.38. I will add it in the tutorial that I am writing.
undefined says Solution is found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72223738/failed-to-initialize-sparse-checkout
undefined says This was the actual error in the terminal.
undefined says Do you think this should be added to repo? That git version should be up to date. Other people might face same issue if they have older version of git.
undefined says Absolutely. Would you mind doing a PR?
undefined says If so please tag me when submitted, or even better DM me.
undefined says I will create a PR
undefined says Thank you please DM me when you have. Thank you very much 🙂
undefined says Thanks for sharing!
undefined says I got an error installing Celo Composer. Does anyone know how to solve this? I already cleared the npm-cache

undefined says I also have an error, it's different though:

```
sh: celo-composer: command not found
```
undefined says i think its `npx celo-composer`
undefined says I tried installing it on two other computers and got the same error.

I tested with node v18.13.0 but also with previous versions and had the same error.
undefined says @Eric Nakagawa ◘
undefined says There will be an update today and then I will perform the installation again
undefined says That's what I type (what it says in the README), but I get this error
undefined says It looks like you installed node using nvm for Windows or you don't have it installed. Try teh command npm i -g npx and then run celo composer command
undefined says npm i -g npx
undefined says if you have node installed
undefined says The reason why it's weird for me is over the past few months I've used Celo composer off and on, I've always downloaded the zip on the same computer and then opened the directory in the terminal and followed the readme exactly. And it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
undefined says File exists: /Users/cfabiano/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/npx

Should I do --force ?
undefined says Better to wait because today an update of Celo Composer should be released
undefined says I saw they updated yesterday have you had any luck? I still receive the same result
undefined says I spoke with@0xNestor just now and he is checking it.
undefined says Please check what is your npm package version? 
npm info @celo/celo-composer version
undefined says I typed npm version and I received:

npm: '9.3.0'
undefined says i typed :
npm info @celo/celo-composer version

and got:
1.0.3
undefined says @0xNestor, @vissequ  is experiencing a different error
undefined says Celo
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/bill-and-ted-beethoven-gif-19603476
undefined says @EwertonLP It works for me
undefined says 
undefined says I am using node `v16.19.0`
undefined says Nvm `8.19.3`
undefined says For anyone needing information with installation and usage of Celo composer. There is a community docs here https://celo-composer-community-docs.vercel.app/docs/frameworks/react-app/installation-and-setup. That you can take advantage of
undefined says Works for me too
undefined says Thank you!!
undefined says Hi @vissequ . I'm having trouble deploying my celo composer app on vercel. Kindly assist
undefined says Create a folder under the root folder and name it pages.
undefined says Thank you @iamoracle | Celo please let us know Chizaa if that doesn't work.
undefined says You might need to create an index.js file inside the created folder.

undefined says Hello @aaron | cLabs | pretty clueless,


React-Celo is failing while using cUSD as feeCurrency. Kindly look into this. 


Error message:

{"code":-32000,"message":"gasprice is less than gas price minimum floor"}}
undefined says Is it because of gas limit? Previously on truffle i used to manually set gas limit to 40000 for the deployments to work
undefined says https://github.com/critesjosh/hello_contract-truffle/issues/2
undefined says I guess as much too. How do I set this value in React Celo? There is no mention in the documentation.
undefined says Are you using hardhat or truffle?
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/react-celo/issues better to create an issue here
undefined says Hardhat
undefined says It's not a hardhat problem. You only see the error while sending a transaction with feeCurrency as cUSD

undefined says Hello please how do I fix this? I am trying  to install celo composer using this command:  npx @celo/celo-composer@latest create
undefined says Do you have node installed?
undefined says I think you’re not using a proper version of nodejs
undefined says Ok I will look into the node version
undefined says Hello @ELIO | IntoTheVerse I upgraded the node version to 18  and I am still getting the same error
undefined says Let me look into this today
undefined says Ok thank you
undefined says Sometimes I remove the ‘@‘ ‘latest’ command and it works
undefined says Did'nt work for me
undefined says No luck with this?

```
npx @celo/celo-composer
```
undefined says I should get back to you on this issue by evening today. Would you mind creating a post on developer-forum, with 'celo-composer' tag, the discussions would be helpful for other developers in the future
undefined says Also post all error messages you enounter with screenshots to explain the problem well
undefined says Ok I will do that
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Hello @here, how do I install @celo/rainbowkit-celo in a react-native dapp ? Should I start by installing `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi viem` or does @celo/rainbowkit-celo add them as dependencies
undefined says Hello, this is the issue I'm getting when trying to connect with the Valora and Celo wallet on the celo-composer boilerplate website
undefined says ```js
Unhandled Runtime Error
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'uri')

```
undefined says they are not included as dependencies.  add them separately. 

Im not sure that rainbowkit supports react native
undefined says Can you guide me to your code ?
undefined says It is the same code as the one found in the boilerplate
undefined says Only difference is I added my projectId
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/react-app/pages/_app.tsx
undefined says Sorry, should have been more specific about which boilerplate, it's the React one
undefined says let me check and get back to you
undefined says Hey, any update?
undefined says Hey sorry, did not get a chance to. Let me get back to you!
undefined says Hi, this has been posted by one of our community members. 

Avoid running into errors while launching Celo-composer
1. Navigate to `packages/hardhat` directory
2. Install _node_modules_  with `yarn install`
3. Visit `hardhat.config.js` file and do two things
i. Comment out `require("@typechain/hardhat");`
ii. Comment out `typechain` object provided in `module.exports` object

⚠️ Do this before doing anything else

Have a bugfree day 🍀
resharing in case anyone has been running into issues
undefined says Hey, have you been able to look into it?
undefined says are you using rainbowkit or react celo?
undefined says Rainbowkit
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/rainbowkit-celo do you have code to valora using rainbow kit in your project
undefined says This is the code I'm using https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/react-app/pages/_app.tsx . Worth noting, the code is unchanged, It's essentially the code you get when initialising the composer for a React.js project
undefined says got you, so you must be using wallet connect module right?
undefined says yes
undefined says @iamoracle | Celo hey bro, have you tried connecting valora alfajores wallet to wallet connetc on celo composer. I am also facing issues with rainbow-kit 
- using iOS Alfajores testing app of Valora and Valora wallet as well 
- My connection times out while using the scanner through valora app

However in the console i get websocket errors
undefined says This is probably an error with the key. Create a new project key from https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app
undefined says Done that 😅
undefined says Is it working?
undefined says https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation
undefined says ...

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: 'My RainbowKit App',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  chains
});

...
undefined says The Valora and Celo Wallet options also do not work and this is the error that breaks the app:
```js

undefined says @ELIO | IntoTheVerse  Okay something weird happened, when I try to install the dependencies using yarn, everything works. However, I get the issues when using npm. I use the following versions for node, npm and yarn:
**
Node.js - v18.0.0
Yarn - v3.6.0
Npm - 8.6.0**
undefined says I use yarn itself. exactly the version you are using
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation could you help here ?
undefined says I am using rainbowkit and I didn't use any client id or key from WalletConnect works for me though
undefined says have you tried a different wallet?
undefined says I used Zerion
undefined says I was trying Valora
undefined says even @Farzeen is trying the same one. I thought we needed to add separate code for Valora. https://github.com/celo-org/rainbowkit-celo
undefined says @yannsolol Hey I removed the message for the Discord invitation, because I do not think this is the proper channel for promoting it. I'm not sure the best channel, and I wanted to reach out to you so that you knew what happened. Please feel free to reply to discuss the best channel if you wish!
undefined says Hi, any update?
undefined says @ELIO | IntoTheVerse @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation Hi any update?
undefined says Hey @Farzeen I was not able to connect to Valora even with the key. Could you try using other wallets ? Or you need Valora specifically ?
undefined says I was able to successfully connect
undefined says Check this branch

https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/tree/therealharpaljadeja/react-app-wcv2
undefined says Was it an issue with wallet connect then ?
undefined says I don't think so
undefined says Try remove `rainbowkit-celo` that did give me an issue after that I copied all the code I needed to make it work for Celo and Alfajores
undefined says Got it.
undefined says we had one issue with rainbowkit-celo which we fixed in 1.0.1 https://github.com/celo-org/rainbowkit-celo/pull/47#discussion_r1245517043
undefined says can anyone point me to a codebase for building on CELO with fultter?
or any framework based on flutter, thanks🙏
undefined says Celo-composer has built in support for Flutter also. You can try it out
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/tree/main/packages/flutter-app
undefined says Thank you.
undefined says Hey guys
undefined says I've never been able to use Celo composer
undefined says The set up is always a pain in my neck
undefined says Anyone experienced what I'm experiencing?
undefined says I always get "unexpected end of json input" error anytime I run 'npx celo composer create'
undefined says It gets stuck when trying to clone the Celo composer repo and move into it.
undefined says When I switched to later version of npm 18.12.1 the issue is the same.
undefined says Hey @bobelr#8524 this should fix your issue. Next time you have any problem with Celo Composer, create a post on #🔖︱developer-forums , and we will help you out. The post on forum would also help to deliver answers to similar issues faced by other developers in the community. 
Thank you!
undefined says Cool. I'll do that. Thanks
undefined says @ELIO | IntoTheVerse It worked. I'm so excited about this. Been a long time I've tried to use Celo composer and wasn't working for me.

Looks like the version of NPM I used was the problems. The recent npm version is a blast. I use nvm for installing the version of npm I need. Had to uninstall all of the versions of npm using `nvm uninstall <version>`. Uninstall nvm itself from the control panel. Then I install npm using the installer package from the official website, and viola, I have Celo composer running.
undefined says Thanks you @ELIO | IntoTheVerse
undefined says I’m happy it worked! Cheers
undefined says Hi guys, how I can connect Celo Extension Wallet to frontend with next, even if as no longer support
undefined says Also, when I connect a wallet on IOS with safari, I need to reload the Page after connect the wallet.
I'm using rainbowkit
undefined says https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-transactions-lesson check this repo 
window.celo instead of window.ethereum
undefined says im curious what your usecase is
undefined says Hello guys, I'm having trouble with the latest celo composer hardhat environment. Even after setting up solidity-coverage, I still get the same error🤔
undefined says have you installed solidity coverage properly?
undefined says $ `npm install --save-dev solidity-coverage`
undefined says What version of node, npm, are you using?
undefined says Working with node version 18
undefined says Yes. i have done that

undefined says Can you check this please ?
undefined says Maybe some version of dependency conflicts
undefined says Hi there! Can you please create this post on #🔖︱developer-forums other devs will be able to help you.
undefined says will do; thx!
undefined says have tagged you in the forum post

undefined says 👋 Hey channel
undefined says https://tenor.com/view/disney-moana-youre-welcome-maui-dance-gif-15810606
undefined says Hi here! I have been checking  celostats reporting issues on baklava and seems that the stats submitting cannot recover when the connection is interrupted. Restarting the validator or the proxy seems to fix it and it starts reporting again. I will try to dig a bit deeper on the problems to see if we can recover gracefully without restarting any component.
undefined says that's weird.... @Ponti | cLabs might be able to shed some light into this... he did some changes to celostats reporting
undefined says and this is the new version, so his changes should be already in
undefined says that's probably because we are adding `ethstats` or `celostats` to each proxy.
undefined says Only one proxy should have it
undefined says I remember adding that only the first proxy was the one in charge of the stats using celotools. Maybe that reboot used the same template, but every proxy was considered the first proxy?
undefined says In this case there is only 1 proxy for each validator, but could be that we updated the proxy/validator not at the same exact time (i.e.: upgrade first the proxy to 1.2.2, then upgrade the validator)
undefined says Ah, I misunderstood the error. Maybe the proxy got stuck waiting the message signed, and didn't retried to send it. I can check that this week
undefined says I would like to ask if it is possible to run Celo in a private network, and if there is any documentation
undefined says @asghaier we currently don't have any doc. But i recommend you take a look at https://github.com/celo-org/infrastructure/tree/master/helm-charts/testnet. 

What we do internally is use k8s + helm to launch an internal private network.
undefined says thanks @Mariano | cLabs I am assuming that I have to change the network name and id in the values.yaml file to run my own private network
undefined says Also, will the private network support the Phone Number Public Key feature
undefined says mmm i don't think so. In fact i'm missing a big part of it. You need to manually deploy the core contracts, to have a fully functional celo testnet. That means running truffle migrate on the protocol package in the monorepo.

Again, not very documente, so it might be hard
undefined says @Mariano | cLabs what about the question that is private network support the Phone Number Public Key feature, does that mean if I deploy the core contracts it will support this feature
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/master/packages/phone-number-privacy/signer
Here it says Forno(node that celo's running) supports PNP, so I assume if you have a private network with core contracts deployed, you got PNP key feature
undefined says So, thinking about celostats @Valentin | cLabs @Ponti | cLabs @Mariano | cLabs @pranay  -
undefined says Anyone know JB's discor handle?
undefined says From a requirements perspective -- the first main ask is make it trustable again. Ensure every validator that is reporting in, shows up on the list, every time, with the correct details.
undefined says Make sure this happens despite proxies being spun up or down, nodes being upgraded, and hoptswapped, etc... key rotation
undefined says We more or less added most of the details that validators needed already -- but there are a couple more minor tickets that from prior experience would be useful
undefined says Being able to see versions for both validators as well as the reporting proxy would be helpful
undefined says Being able to see consensus round number too. (in case of a consensus failure)
undefined says Being able to see number of validator peers vs regular peers
undefined says Then there are future requirements around full nodes, but i don't think we need to get to that yet
undefined says What about Registered but not reporting validators?
undefined says It's useful to see registered but not reporting
undefined says probably useful to hide them too ?
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/1234
undefined says We have already a known issue, about the data that has to be "merged" by the proxies. Today, only one proxy send its metrics, to the validator, to sign it, and then forwards it to the celostats-server. So, if you have 2 proxies, there's some data that we are not collecting
undefined says For example, the peers connected, should be a merged-field
undefined says Yes, probably more thinking about how to show info on proxies vs validators.  For example, you might want a nested list underneath each validator. Or maybe not.
undefined says Well, defining that will probably determine if we need changes on the blockchain side, or the celostats-server.
Do we expect to have only one message per validator-proxies, or 1 for every proxy.
undefined says Another change that we talked about, is to extract the messages sent between validator-proxies, to another protocol. Today we are using istanbul...
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/1233
undefined says Hey @asghaier, a private network will not support the same protocol for Phone Number mapping out of the box. The reason is because the the Phone Number mapping relies upon a special service (ODIS) for maintaining user privacy:
https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity/phone-number-privacy
This service is currently operated only on Alfajores and Mainnet. The service is open-source so you can deploy your own instance of the Combiner and Signer found here:
https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/master/packages/phone-number-privacy
If you're just interested in a test network with the feature, I'd definitely recommend using Alfajores instead of rolling your own private network. Either way, I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
undefined says I created a PR for merging go-ethereum v1.9.13 from upstream: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/1251 .  I will also schedule a call to present the main changes and issues that came up, but not sure when yet, given the hectic schedule this coming week with cLabs' milestone planning.
undefined says **CeloStats**
@timmoreton | cLabs @Valentin | cLabs 

We want to work on this. To me, there are still problems with validators having problem connecting or sending info to celostats. Or maybe it's about loosing the connection and never reconnect. But that's to me the MAIN issue to resolve.

After that, we want to add many things to the payload we report. The things listed by tim are some of them. This imply changing the network protocol so that proxy can get info from the validator, right now it only gets the signature.

The way i see it, we would need web help on fixing the connecting issue, it's unclear whose the culprit here... if the reporter or the server.

For the expanded reports, I think we can split the problems into:

a) Be able to report more info, and get that by API on the server (but not on the UI)
b) See new info in the UI (more challenging, depends on what info we add)
undefined says Awesome!!!! I still need to review 1.12
undefined says @Mariano | cLabs @Valentin | cLabs @asa does it make sense to make a celostats bubble? design, front end, backend?
undefined says It's not clear to me what that bubble would be trying to accomplish, tbh
undefined says Fix the connection issue, I get
undefined says Well, diagnose and fix
undefined says i don't think we need a bubble for this. Just collaboration
undefined says Maybe someone on both teams to sync an collaborate... but no more than that. 

* Debug connection issues
* Define an API
undefined says On blockchain side, expanding the report payload, means gathering information from the validator and the other proxies, and this is more complex that it seems. You need to modify the network protocol that proxy and validator uses to communicate. Which today is the same protocol it's used for everything else. So we have another issues that would be really important for this, that is to create a proxy-validator protocol that is separate. This would us flexibility to change things without disrupting the other protocol (istanbul one)
undefined says @yourbuddyconner @trevor | cLabs @jcortejoso | cLabs guys, we need to understand if during milestone 7 something has been done on the “validator’s observabiilty”
And if there’s work to be done on blockchain side during M8.
Can you provide some context?
undefined says Hey @Mariano | cLabs ! We have deprecated `geth-exporter` and moved to geth native metrics instead. 
From a metric perspective, I think we have not added new metrics or dashboards during the last milestone (there are some new metrics regarding the block processing time and validator performance, but those have not been merged into master yet)
undefined says But have we worked on the opt-in metrics for validators?
undefined says @yourbuddyconner was working on a PoC with Thanos. Probably he can give a good answer about this.
undefined says @Mariano | cLabs opt-in metrics pipeline was too complex for M7 given the wide array of requirements and stakeholders. Let’s schedule some time to talk about it so I can gather your requirements.
undefined says Continuing the Celostats discussion -- from asking the validators (see #🏠︱validators-operators channel) and also talking to @yaz and others, seems like Celostats is here to stay! And we should invest time in getting it operational/trustable again. 

My tension was around having many web services to support (eg. validator explorer that does not get much use anymore). But given the value of Celostats, it does not seem wise to sunset it. So my questions are: 
- what is the low hanging fruit we could address to make it more useful? (see the great feedback from validators)
- how do we effectively collaborate between blockchain <> web services? Seems like no to a bubble, but would one blockchain eng partner with web-services team to investigate?
- can we define success clearly per @victorgraf 's point so we don't end up at a fork in the road again?

cc @Mariano | cLabs @jb | cLabs @timmoreton | cLabs
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs and I summarized what we believe should be done on this milestone here https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/1252

We tried to keep it simple, and not to have too many wishes. So to define something that it's workable on a milestone.

Maybe for next milestone we can a get a more detailed description of what we would want from it.
undefined says Are we going to have a sync on Monday given that our minds are occupied with milestone planning?
undefined says Sorry a little late on the celostats train, but given the work that @yourbuddyconner might be doing on the prometheus-based pipeline, would it make sense to further invest in celostats?
undefined says My feeling is the Prometheus pipeline is going to be an M9 or early M10 thing, so I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s time to stop contributing to celostats personally. 

It would also by no means be publicly consumable at release, or at least that’s not a requirement I’ve gathered yet.
undefined says I asked that question earlier as well @nambrot, and was convinced that it makes sense to keep celostats because the UI is useful (see validators' feedback in the operators channel). So I see it less as significantly more investment, and more like doing some minor work to get it back in good shape.
undefined says Appreciate the feedback y'all. I'm probably just coming from a place where I have been part of the design of some of these solutions and they were painted as explicit short-term trade-offs, but here we are nearly a year later. Totally understand that further short-term fixes can be well worth the trade-off, just wanted to give the perspective that IMO going prom-based to me seems like the directionally better thing
undefined says And maybe @kevjue | C Labs (Celo) re-surfacing a bug hunt from a year ago where ethstats reporting caused stalled networks brought up back memories as well 😐
undefined says @Deleted User what's the TLDR of the baklava bootnode incident?
undefined says TL;DR is it was using the wrong private key for most of friday and so wasn't functioning as a bootnode (since the enode is generated from the key), and it didn't trigger any alerts
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs something to add to the celostats github issue https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/601046166620078100/784722543348416512
undefined says I'm noticing a couple of things about the LES server that I didn't know (and which I suspect none of us knew):
1. Though the peer limits can be specified with `--maxpeers` and `--light.maxpeers`, their handling (inherited from upstream) seems questionable.  For example, if you use 1100 for maxpeers and 1000 for light.maxpeers (as we recommend in the docs for full nodes), p2p server's dialed peers goal is still maxpeers / DialRatio, or maxpeers / 3, which in this case would be 366.  AFAIK, light servers don't dial light clients (only the other way around), since light clients run only discv5 and don't advertise the LES topic, so light servers wouldn't find light clients through discovery (only the other way around).  So what would happen if the node gets to 100 eth peers is it would then continue to try dialing more peers but when it connects to them it would immediately disconnect them due to already being at its limit of 100 for eth peers.  I confirmed this behavior using go-ethereum with lower limits (maxpeers 105, light.maxpeers 100).  This may not be trivial to fix because `p2p/server.go` is used both by the light client and the light server
2. `--light.serve` supports values larger than 100%.  At first I was puzzled by the following code, which looks like it makes threads always be 4: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/b44f24e3e6644a2034ce23037827b21aa59e441d/les/server.go#L85-L90 (link points to current master, but the logic is the same going back to Feb 2019).  Then I found out that 100 isn't the maximum value, as mentioned at https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18230 and https://gist.github.com/zsfelfoldi/93792da3c56dffdb594ff91aebd74262 .  I haven't dug into the code, so I don't know how it's all handled.
undefined says On an unrelated note, is anyone else seeing this error a lot in VS Code now: "Error loading workspace: no metadata for [...]".  Googling turned up this issue, but not much info on it yet https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43004
undefined says ohhh... this makes me remember about the issue we saw where nodes are constantly creating connections. That made us start investigating the peer connection metrics too.

The missing part of your description if i recall correctly, is that when you set:
```
maxpeers = 1000
ligh.maxpeers = 1100
```
you get something like
```
maxethpeers = 100
```
correct?
undefined says That's right.  So the dialed connection goal will be 366, far more than 100.  I asked in the go-ethereum discord to confirm my impression that this is a bug.
undefined says **On 2:**
No idea. I've always wondered how did it measure cpu time internally
undefined says I remember we had to do some tweaking with those flags...  Maybe @asa or @kevjue  remembers
undefined says Are you using `gopls` on vscode?
undefined says yes, sorry, I replied the user a few days ago. It doesn't seems to be the same issue, but I will take it in count
undefined says I know we changed the defaults, changing the default MaxPeers from 50 to 175 (makes sense given 100 validators) and default LightPeers from 100 to 99 (haven't investigated why).  Don't remember seeing major changes in how the flags are read and used.  There is definitely some unintuitive behavior in how the params are handled in both go-ethereum and celo-blockchain, in that it behaves differently when it uses the defaults than when you specify explicitly values equal to the defaults.
e.g. go-ethereum with defaults (50 maxpeers and 100 light.maxpeers): `ETH=50 LES=100 total=150`
go-ethereum with --maxpeers 50 and --light.maxpeers 100: `ETH=-50 LES=100 total=50` (which later errors out because ETH is less than zero).  In other words, if you rely on the defaults it adds light to max peers, while if you use the flags it assumes light is included in maxpeers.
undefined says Yeah, with the pls it seems to do much better in terms of speed and completeness of finding references and so on.  But if it's going to be unreliable, who knows
undefined says I understand is the only way to go if you use go modules
undefined says My nodes are always showing when start:

`Maximum peer count                       ETH=175 LES=0 total=175`

Does it mean that maximum 0 light peers can connect?
undefined says Yes, You can change that using `--light.maxpeers` (e.g. in the docs we suggest `--maxpeers 1100 --light.maxpeers 1000` to serve light clients).  It looks like that 0 value is because the default value of 99 doesn't take effect because we have an `if` that uses `GlobalIsSet()`.  I think this logic needs a second look, as well as the defaults.  [Edit: on a second look, the default is used but not in the logic that generates that log line.  I will include a fix for this in a PR I'm working on.]
undefined says see DM please
undefined says Opened a PR to make serving light clients opt-in rather than opt-out, and to fix a bug that was causing the "Maximum peer count" log message to be incorrect when the light server is on and the default light client peers maximum is being used.  https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/1263
undefined says Hi, I have some technical questions from a potential partner in Turkey. Could you please help me with answers?  1. In what languages can we write smart contracts on Celo blockchain? 2. Has there been any work done on zero-knowledge proof on Celo? 3. Is it possible to set up a private Celo network to work on inter-bank and in-country euro transfers? Any help appreciated. Thanks!
undefined says 1. Solidity is the primary. More generally, any language that compiles to EVM bytecode, so Viper would also work. (WASM is not yet supported)
2. We use SNARKs for the Plumo protocol. It's our first application of SNARKs to Celo, but it certainly won't be the last. https://medium.com/celoorg/the-plumo-ceremony-ac7649e9c8d8
3. It's certainly possible to set up private networks. 👍
undefined says Thanks Victor!
undefined says Can you please elaborate a bit about the private network?
undefined says Anyone can give me an introductions about connecting to Celo blockchain using MetaMask ? Many thanks and Happy New Year everyone 🥳
undefined says I want to test somethings on Celo blockchain 🤪
undefined says Happy new year! I’m working on Chaindata snapshots and running into the following error message when doing a restore: `Error starting protocol stack: gap (#3116616) in the chain between ancients and leveldb`. Does anyone know what to do in this case?
undefined says chat with @Joshua he has a working solution for chaindata backups
undefined says Re: the error message or re chaindata backups in general?
undefined says Backups. The error doesn’t ring a bell and currently miles away from the computer. Happy new year!!!
undefined says Enjoy 🙏

undefined says @nambrot monorepo?? we don't do monorepo here 😛 !

kidding, let me check
undefined says @nambrot all seem relevant to me, and for blockchain..

I have doubts with:

   * https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/2236 doesn't seem to be blockchain, but a problem of whoever is using it? Need more info/context here @trevor | cLabs 
  * https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/2445 seems to overlap with our lightclient issues/work. Not sure if to close this in favor of others, or what to do with it. I'll leave that decision to @victorgraf who has been working on this.
undefined says I agree that issue is a problem of whoever is using it and not blockchain's responsibility, though I'm surprised the nonce too low logs were logged as `ERROR`, that feels really high
undefined says @Joshua and I have been looking into the missed blocks on baklava.  A positive result is that the randomness bugfix worked!  That, combined with everyone now having upgraded to Churrito means we no longer have any validators.  Besides that, here are some findings:
1. There is a logic bug in `clearBacklogForSeq()` (https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/master/consensus/istanbul/core/backlog.go#L225-L227), which means that backlogs from previous blocks are never properly cleared.  As a result, the backlog can get full, and then storing new messages to the backlog fails and they are instead dropped.  We saw this in action on one of the validators.  However, this is not a regression from v1.2.x, and in the context in which it happened fixing it would not have prevented the problem.  The context was that a validator wasn't peered with the proposer of the block before the block it proposes.  As a result, it never got the preprepare for the parent block's consensus process and didn't process and store the commits it got.  Then when its turn to propose a block came, it could only include the quorum of signatures on the block itself, it couldn't add the other commits it got because it never processed them.
2. There are some remaining peering issues.  Some seem to involve actual networking errors (`"i/o timeout"` dialing those peers, and a case where in the discovery v4 logs we see node A pinging node B and getting a response, but when node B pings node A there is no response).  Some are suggestive of networking problems, but not definitive (one node correctly sends out enode query message for a node it needs to update its record for, but doesn't the response back).

[to be continued due to discord message size limit]
undefined says More generally, we've identified three things that can lead to a missing signature on a block:
1. You are not peered with the proposer.  In this case you never get the preprepare and just can't participate in consensus at all for that block.
2. You are not peered with the next block's proposer.  In that case, your signature will be included in the block itself if your commit is among the first (2/3 of validator set size) commits that the proposer receives.  Otherwise, your signature will not be included in the block, and neither will it be added to the next block's parent seal because you aren't peered to the next block's proposer and so they can't get your commit.
3. The next block's proposer (Alice) isn't peered with the current block's proposer (Bob).  In that case, Alice won't get Bob's preprepare and so she can't process the commits she gets for that block, including the one she gets from you.  As a result, when its her turn to propose the block, she has no commits to add to the parent seal, and so 1/3 of the validators will end up having their signatures not included (leading to a very long red vertical column on celo cauldron).  We saw this happen a couple of days ago, and that is how we found the backlog bug. 
 But fixing that bug won't solve this problem, because Bob still wouldn't have the preprepare from Alice

[to be continued]
undefined says We've previously thought of ways to make consensus more robust in the face of incomplete peering.  It seems that the biggest choke-point is the preprepare.  So we've been thinking that a big improvement would be to have some secondary mechanism for getting the preprepare to everyone, including nodes the proposer may not be connected to.  That way every node could participate and send out commits. And though the proposer may not get your commit, chances are the next block's proposer will and so then your signature will still get included. 

Essentially, to miss a block you'd have to:
```
not be peered to two consecutive proposers OR (not be in the first 2/3 of one block AND not peered to the next block's proposer)
```
rather than how it is now:
```
not be peered to the proposer OR (not be in the first 2/3 of one block AND not peered to the next block's proposer) OR (not be in the first 2/3 of one block AND the next proposer isn't peered to the current proposer)
```
This of course would mean some redundant network communication, but that might not be too bad because the preprepare is the least network-intensive part of consensus.  Of course, if we do this, the next choke-point is commits going to the next proposer, which could also then be improved.  We'd be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts about whether this would be feasible and the the possible downsides or tradeoffs involved.  To be clear, this would be an improvement for the future to make consensus more robust, not a solution to the remaining issues on baklava
undefined says @Deleted User @Joshua This is so incredibly helpful and definitly the best investigation of these issues so far 🤩 

One comment on the further sharing of the pre-prepare is that during some round changes the pre-prepare attaches a round-change certificate that is of size O(quorum^2). In these cases, further gossiping of the full pre-prepare can be quite expensive.
undefined says Thanks for pointing that out, I'm still not familiar with the details of the round changes.  Since such a change would just be an optimization, we could do it only during the first round and not during round changes.
undefined says As a tangent, if we did make such improvements, it would be all the more important for us to gain visibility into validator peering status (since most of them won't lead to missed signatures anymore).  Right now we have to ask people to attach to their nodes and check for us (and it'd be even more complex if they were using more than one proxy).  Ideally, we would have a bitmap of which validators your validator is in contact with and send that bitmap to celostats, or something like that.
undefined says I think this should be another nudge toward developing and opt-in metrics collection pipeline including pushing easy-to-use packages for metrics and monitoring to validators and allowing them to sharing data at will with cLabs, each other, and publicly.
undefined says Following up on the remaining peering issues, we found a couple of validators weren't accepting inbound connections, which was due to firewall misconfiguration.  Now that they've been fixed, Baklava is looking good on celo cauldron.  Not 100% green, but comparable to mainnet.
undefined says @Joshua @Mariano | cLabs Here is a PR for the backlog logic bug: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/1300 (it turned out the baklava issues were not due to this, but we found it in looking at baklava logs from a node that was having trouble)
undefined says Really looks GREAT! Excellent job on this! It's been a long time coming!
undefined says Hello, I would like to run my own network locally running `./geth` to test a Keep off-chain client interacting with the contracts that will be deployed on Celo-blockchain. https://medium.com/celoorg/tbtc-integrates-bridge-with-celo-blockchain-platform-973c43d1f0a4 nambrot mentioned that I would need a genesis file to encode the initial validator set. I guess a single network validator should be enough for my use case. Can someone please share a `genesis.json` so I can use it when starting the network locally?
undefined says I know there's also a public testnet Alfajores, but I would like to try both connecting an off-chain client on my local & testnet
undefined says @Deleted User , @Tong | cLabs has some ideas on cleaning up `worker.go`. Can you both chat, to see if upstream merge has changes here as well and if this would complicate the whole merge?
undefined says cc @Mariano | cLabs does Javi have a playbook for how he instantiates a mock testnet that resembles our mainnet for when we plan to do hardfork testing? It might be useful to @dimpar who is testing things out with Keep/tBTC

it would be worth also adding it to the documentation page so I can help with that after
undefined says Another golang security patch coming on Tuesday, no hints as to what it's about: https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/KvrRblbXp_w/m/Wmy64hQADQAJ
undefined says Here is a `genesis.json` from my local testing environment
undefined says You can launch the Celo client just like Geth and it will indeed produce blocks. Many features of Celo (e.g. Elections) require the core contracts through, so if that becomes an issue you will need to have those deployed. At that point I'd advise using some of the tooling built into the `celo-monorepo`. I personally use the following branch, which I can provide more detail on how to use if you want to go down that path https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/3954
undefined says Thank you @victorgraf for this `genesis.json` file. I'll try it on my local and see how it goes.
undefined says @victorgraf I've tried your `genesis.json` file and I think it solved the problem with the account balance. But I stumbled upon another one when running ./geth:  
```
state="Waiting for new round" address=0x2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a err="not an elected validator 0x2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a"
```
I don't see it is mining any new blocks. `0x2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a`is the account with a balance that I've added to `genesis.json` next to your account and I run the following command:
```
./geth --port 3000 --networkid 1101 --identity "somerandomidentity" \
    --ws --wsaddr "127.0.0.1" --wsport "8546" --wsorigins "*" \
    --rpc --rpcport "8545" --rpcaddr "127.0.0.1" --rpccorsdomain "" \
    --rpcapi "debug,miner,admin,eth,net,web3,personal" \
    --wsapi "debug,miner,admin,eth,net,web3,personal" \
    --datadir=/Users/dp/ethereum/data/celo-data --syncmode "fast" \
    --mine --miner.threads=1 -unlock=0x2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a \
    --allow-insecure-unlock
```
The problem occurs when I try to deploy contracts. It just hangs forever on block 0. Do you see any flags missing or are incorrect? Or maybe I should use `celo-monorepo` tooling instead?
undefined says So in order to change the address in the genesis block, the new address needs a balance and also to be encoded as a genesis validator in the `extraData` field. Deploying core contracts additionally requires setting the storage field `0xb53127684a568b3173ae13b9f8a6016e243e63b6e8ee1178d6a717850b5d6103` which IIRC sets the initital owner of the registry.

You can try replacing each instance of `47e172F6CfB6c7D01C1574fa3E2Be7CC73269D95` with your new address `2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a` and the BLS public key `4fa3f67fc913878b068d1fa1cdddc54913d3bf988dbe5a36a20fa888f20d4894c408a6773f3d7bde11154f2a3076b700d345a42fd25a0e5e83f4db5586ac7979ac2053cd95d8f2efd3e959571ceccaa743e02cf4be3f5d7aaddb0b06fc9aff00` with your own. You can get your BLS public key by running `geth account proof-of-possession --bls 2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a 2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a`. I've not tried this myself, but believe it should work.
undefined says Of course, the most honest answer is that I always use the `celo-monorepo` tooling, so that's the only path I actually know how to use 100%.
undefined says Finally I was able to run a Keep client on my local box being connected to my local celo-blockchain! Thank you @victorgraf for your help! And just for the future reference..  in `extraData` field not only I had to change BLS public key, but also an address `47e172F6CfB6c7D01C1574fa3E2Be7CC73269D95` -> `2B2976824682233807A197081119dA511AF12F7a`
undefined says Ok, I'm glad it worked! Sorry it's not quite a bit easier.
undefined says hi everyone
undefined says I am looking for some RPC documentation
undefined says can someone point me to it ?
undefined says is there any RPC public providers ?
undefined says @Alex https://forno.celo.org is our free rpc endpoint you can use to connect to Celo mainnet
undefined says Thx @yaz
undefined says Any docs regarding how to find proposals
undefined says And governance?
undefined says https://celo.stake.id/#/
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/voting-governance
undefined says https://forum.celo.org/c/governance/12
undefined says https://forum.celo.org/t/governance-at-a-glance/471/2
undefined says cc @Alex ^
undefined says governance at a glance has a nice overview. the governance category on the forum also has posts on governance proposal discussions. the stake.id link shows things proposed on mainnet. voting on governance docs shows you how you can do that
undefined says I want to get them directly from rpc queries
undefined says Is it doable?
undefined says i dunno if we ever did that. cc @Mariano | cLabs @nambrot do you guys know if it's possible to pull in available governance proposals just via RPC querying?
undefined says Pull all proposals + a specific proposal
undefined says you can do that currently in celocli
undefined says our cli tool
undefined says not sure about specifically calling an RPC method for it
undefined says you can use `DEBUG=rpc:*` with the `celocli governance:list` and `celocli governance:show --proposalID N` to see the contents of the RPC requests
undefined says Would like to have it through rpc. I don t have a node....
undefined says I assume celocli works only with a node. Is it?
undefined says Yes, but there is a public node
undefined says https://forno.celo.org
undefined says So i can use celocli pointing to a public node?
undefined says Yes, but, you will need a way to sign your transaction, before sending it to the node
undefined says Signing for what?
undefined says I just need to query so far
undefined says GET proposals
GET proposal/:id
undefined says Something like that
undefined says sorry, I didn't read your requests. For listing and query it does not matter
undefined says Thx. Cool will try that.
undefined says check the `--node` flag
undefined says Thx
undefined says hi @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says how does it work ?
undefined says https://forno.celo.org/api?module=account&action=eth_get_balance&address=0xD5afAaA7256C9eb86376c4214635Dd56dffBD3A8
undefined says I tried to use the RPC you provided me based on https://explorer.celo.org/api_docs
undefined says I tried also : 
 curl -X GET "https://forno.celo.org/api?module=account&action=eth_get_balance&address=0xD5afAaA7256C9eb86376c4214635Dd56dffBD3A8" -H "accept: application/json"
undefined says no success
undefined says if someone can send me some feedbackss on how to use that RPC service
undefined says would be cool
undefined says thx
undefined says that api is the one that `explorer.celo.org` is defining
I highly recommend you to use our `ContractKit` instead of trying to re implement all the rpc standard. Using the contractkit, you can connect to forno, and request everything you want
undefined says Do we have any more information about how to ensure folks are reporting to Celostats? https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/697229909545713775/803916697101795338
undefined says @Mariano | cLabs @nambrot can you check if https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/1307 is working now?
undefined says @Alex you can also check out our hosted RPC service https://learn.figment.io/introduction/what-is-datahub, we support Celo and top Web 3 protocols. you can sign up for free and get up to 100k requests/day as part of that free plan 🙂 Here are our Celo docs https://learn.figment.io/network-documentation/celo/rpc-and-rest-api
undefined says left some comments!!
undefined says @Sami Mäkelä left more comments 😛 after i saw you did the changes
undefined says Ok, I was still doing some cleanup
undefined says yeah i saw that.. i just wanted to expedite the process
undefined says It can be checked again, I still have some time to work on it today
undefined says done! and approved! with a minor comment
undefined says In Celo how to find who is the owner of a particular smart contract in CELO
undefined says @debasish0551 Smart contracts in general don't have owners.  Having an owner is a feature that can be included in a contract, for example using OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`.  If a contract has an owner and its code has been uploaded to the Celo explorer, you can see the owner address there.  For example: https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x765de816845861e75a25fca122bb6898b8b1282a/read_contract lists the owner as `0xD533Ca259b330c7A88f74E000a3FaEa2d63B7972` which if you click on it you can then look at its code and it says it's the GovernanceProxy contract.
undefined says @Deleted User Thanks for the info . Can you please help me decode the relationship between benficiary and contract address in celo {
    "Beneficiary": "0x000aAEE22EB8491e72fDff1fF3cDeB1cF071eE76",

undefined says Hey all-- any ideas on why CREATE/CREATE2  is returning something different than what Ethereum would return?
undefined says cc @Mariano | cLabs @victorgraf @nambrot not sure if you guys know
undefined says I'm not sure, I'd let the blockchain folks chime in but I don't think we changed much on the op codes besides some gas repricings of some EIPs I thought
undefined says @Ian | Ubeswap Could you provide more details?  Looking at the code for those opcodes, it hasn't changed relative to Ethereum, so if there are differences it'd have to be in surrounding code
undefined says That's correct, we didn't change opcode. The only possible difference is gas pricing, if we're not up to date with some EIP
undefined says I took a look too. If you use ethers.js's utility functions, it returns something different
undefined says My guess was that it might have to do with gas pricing
undefined says https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/efeeda5e5c3b22f0c211783a635941dc8035ae25/packages/address/src.ts/index.ts#L133
undefined says ^this is the code that doesn't work. I experienced the problem when trying to deploy contracts using ethers
undefined says If you want, I can add you to my (currently private) repo where I'm having this issue
undefined says @Ian | Ubeswap In that case, I believe this is more of a question for #🏠general-mobile , and isn't my area of expertise.  But I think a good first thing to look at would be this: https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/783806028629934110/808037871277703198
undefined says Hi all!  We at cLabs have been kicking around an idea for a change that would improve compatibility with Ethereum wallets and tools, by **adding support for Ethereum-format transactions (i.e. transactions without the 3 Celo-only fields: fee currency, gateway fee, and gateway fee recipient)**.

I've created a proof of concept branch here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/tree/oneeman/eth-compatible-transactions-poc .  The way it works is, when we get a transaction an RLP, we identify based on the number of fields it has whether it's a normal Celo transaction or an eth-compatible transaction.  For serializing to JSON, I've added a boolean field to indicate whether it's an eth-compatible transaction (since in Javascript there is often less-than-full consistency on null vs absent fields).  It's not 100% clear whether that field is necessary, and of course it isn't final (this is just a proof of concept), but it seemed like a good idea.

I've tried this out, and it works out-of-the-box with Ethereum wallets such as metamask (see the screenshot).  Of course,  for eth-compatible transactions the fee has to be paid in Celo (can't use cUSD) and gateway fees can't be used (though, at the moment, gateway fees aren't being used anyway and it's not 100% clear whether full-node incentives will eventually use them or a different mechanism).

This would have to be done as part of a hard fork.  Though it's very late in the game, it may be worth delaying Donut to include this, since much of Donut is aimed at cross-chain bridges and this would lead to much better UX by allowing transacting both in Celo and Ethereum using a single wallet such as Metamask.

Outside of celo-blockchain, any tools that decode Celo transactions from RLP would need to add support for eth-compatible transactions.  With JSON it may be necessary depending on the language and libraries used.

There isn't a CIP yet, but we wanted to bring it up in order to start hearing everyone's thoughts.
undefined says I believe @Rossy has a fork of Ethers.js that works with Celo. Let me see if I can find it.

I also heard you're looking for a MetaMask like wallet. NiftyWallet is adding support right now (see this PR https://github.com/poanetwork/nifty-wallet/pull/446).

Also, DSVR is working on their own CeloMask with the code here: 
https://github.com/dsrvlabs/celo-extension-wallet

Finally, @Alex | cLabs is working on WalletConnect support.
undefined says @Ian | Ubeswap Here's the ethers.js wrapper I mentioned above: https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper
undefined says Thanks. I'm actually using that wrapper and it's returning the wrong contract addresses-- i need to read the transaction receipt in order to get the right address
undefined says Got it. Perhaps @Rossy has seen that issue before.
undefined says @Ian | Ubeswap Ubeswap is a good name
undefined says I haven't seen that issue before no. The wrapper shouldn't be modifying any contract addresses, it just adds tx fields to match Celo's tx schema. Feel free to DM me with some example code and we can try to figure this out 🙂
undefined says Fwiw I couldn't get @Rossy 's ethers project to work either. Can't remember the exact issue, but I ended up reverting to web3 in the end. Would love to revisit it because prefer to use ethers syntax.
undefined says @Thylacine | VladiatorLabs.io Sorry to hear you're both having trouble with the wrapper. It's working well in the web wallet so it's definitely fine for certain use cases but Ethers can do a lot and I haven't tested much beyond the features I'm using directly. If you can share a sample project or snippet that's not working I can try to have a look.
undefined says Thanks I'll see if I can rewind and see what the issues were
undefined says Is there any information on creating NFT on Celo? Have any marketplaces been created for that sort of thing?
undefined says @cult_leader_en I've never looked into it but I saw https://twitter.com/unifty_io/status/1356391954167296001. If you're looking to build a marketplace, Celo also uses the EVM so contracts will work the same
undefined says Is the latest celo-blockchain code already able to serve light clients and receive rewards for it? The docs and some discussions I found in PR's on GitHub seem to indicate so, but here in Discord I've seen conflicting messages.
undefined says @trevor | cLabs ooooooo unifty looks promising! Thanks for the info 🥰
undefined says Question regarding throughput: Has the IBFT throughput on Celo been benchmarked under various conditions? E.g. as a function of validator size?
undefined says And, what is assumed block gas limit?
undefined says IBFT does indeed run as a function of validator set size (It's linear on a single node in normal case, quadratic in worse case, multiply by a factor of n to get total message complexity (how consensus algo's are typically described)). A second thing to consider for IBFT is networking latency, IBFT requires 3 stages of messages (so broadcast msg1, respond w/ gossipping msg2, respond w/gossiping msg3, receive Q msg3's then commit). In terms of benchmarks, we don't have current ones, but are looking at the marginal impact of adding more validators and looking at mainnet bottle necks
undefined says Block gas limit is currently 13 million gas. It is set by governance.
undefined says Great to know. as cUSD is an ERC20, how much gas would a transfer cost? Couldnt find this in the explorer.
undefined says And what do you think of this benchmark:
https://github.com/getamis/istanbul-tools/wiki/Istanbul-BFT-Benchmarking
undefined says A typical valora transaction is 100k gas (50k ERC-20 transfer, 20k paying for fees in cUSD, 30k for `transferWithComment`)
undefined says Kinda like the original IBFT it's outdated. We've got tooling to do pretty much everything there as well as we've instrumented celo-blockchain to understand the timings of different parts of block production and consensus.
undefined says Does token payment for gas fees have to activated by the user? A tx sent to me was paid in CELO.
undefined says Yes, the wallet chooses the fee currency. Valora defaults it to cUSD so user's do not need to keep a CELO balance just to pay for transactions
undefined says Are transactions included via gas price auctions just like in Ethereum?
undefined says Oh, I am just seeing that EIP1559 has been implemented? 😄
undefined says Are there conservative estimates what the throughput would be for standard celo (~21k gas) transfers?
undefined says But I suppose with current block gas limit the throughput is just about 60-80 Tx/s of average sized transactions because of the faster blocktime compared to Ethereum
undefined says Yes it has been implemented. The current block gas target is 1/2. You can see network parameters with `celocli`. I'd say around 50-60 native transfers per second right now (some gas usage for oracles + targeting  50% block gas usage)
undefined says Hi everyone
undefined says I am having trouble using contractKit with typescript
undefined says I am getting this error
undefined says 
undefined says Any help would be appreciated
undefined says @serge__ I'd recommend asking in #🏠general-mobile for questions like this. And if you can share a github link or code snippet that would be helpful 🙂
undefined says Hey @Rossy thanks
undefined says This part from the docs is then obsolete I suppose?
>  Clients include in every transaction the address of a node which, when the transaction is processed, receives the fee.
undefined says More that it's not yet implemented. One area of research is full node incentives, and we have extended transactions to have "gateway fees" that go to a full node serving the light client, however those fees are not enabled
undefined says Interesting concept. It's something Ethereum doesnt have, where you rely on altruistic behavior in most cases.
undefined says But gateway fees go ontop of the basefee paid?
undefined says They do.
undefined says If people are interested, here's a design doc that I've been working on to cache core contract calls in celo-blockchain. Feel free to leave a comment or DM me about it. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ErbG9gWMtmQ-kxl1iNip3-tgkwVbTsJFWFHJbH48Ekg/edit?usp=sharing
undefined says Hi , I was referring the escrow contract. Please correct me if i am wrong. My usecase is :  I want to send rewards and users should be able to claim it. So with Celo, the user could send an invitation to the users and send a payment (reward). So this will be handled by the Escrow contract ? 

The user will accept the invitation and claim the rewards (This will also call the contract function withdraw). 
There is an option for min attestations. So even if no attestations are made , user can access the wallet and perform transactions? 

Has anyone implemented the escrow payments? Any resources or docs would be helpful. I checked out the escrow test file shared by cLabs.  Is there any documentation or tutorial i can follow thru to implement this?

If this is not the right group to post, please let me know.
undefined says @lizgeorge You can x-post that to the #🏠general-core channel, where more devs from the cap circle (contracts and primitives) check more often
undefined says Posted. Thanks!
undefined says hi there. I wanted to check if there was any progress with making Celo backwards-compatible with Ethereum (so we can use metamask and other tools)
undefined says Hi, @andrii.z . Your question was answered earlier today on the #🌌︱ecosystem  channel: https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/704774080603226173/826237763242164255 HTH.
undefined says thank you
undefined says is there a github branch on celo-blockchain that I can use to build a celo client to run a testnet to try out the donut hardfork upgrades?
undefined says @joshc You can use master, or 1.3.0-beta, either one.  If you want to test a local testnet, the easier way is using mycelo.  Otherwise, you can still use mycelo to generate a genesis file for use in the testnet.  Or if you just want to try something against an existing network, we have a private testnet with Donut activated running in k8s
undefined says Running a local testnet with mycelo is very easy and is what I would recommend if it serves your purposes
undefined says 👌thank you 🙏
undefined says Hi everyone, we are a team and we are trying to deploy our own contract on Celo. It's already put on Alfajores, and we are accessing it through Java's ContractKit and generated contract classes. However we have faced a bug we don't know how to resolve. @lizgeorge is my teammate. Liz can you explain further please.
undefined says Hey everyone, 

We are trying to call a payable contract function from the ContractKit which @YasharIsACapital is developing. However while calling the function, we are getting the error 

**"The called function should be payable if you send value and the value you send should be less than your current balance." **

This is due to the validations i have added in the contract to make sure signed value is being sent by the user. 
**require(msg.value == _amount && msg.value > 0);**

While testing from the remix, i am adding the amount  in  the "value" field and able to complete the transaction successfully.

However on the mobile side, we are unable to do so. We tried passing the "weiValue" in the function parameter when yashar is calling the contract. Same error.
 Could you help us understand  how to call the payable functions in Celo and how to pass the value in Celo?
undefined says @nambrot can you help on this? Or point us to someone who can?
undefined says @lizgeorge should be similar to ethereum `payable` -- so not part of the function parameter but as a blockchain transaction parametere
(similar to https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/ReleaseGold.sol#L479)
undefined says Hey @aslawson | cLabs  I am adding  payable as a blockchain transaction parameter.  I can successfully run the contract function through truffle console. 
Question is How can i call payable functions from andoid java sdk ? 
Sharing sample smart contract payable function :
https://gist.github.com/liz-george/1051943a9f876e0947a5870dc2b18792#file-offersample_discord-sol

Thank you for your response!
undefined says i am not as familiar with the java sdk, but it looks like there is a similar bug in web3j, which the celo java sdk is based on. Does this help shine some light on the issue? https://github.com/web3j/web3j/issues/1268
undefined says @joshc In this report the problem is that the wei value is sent as zero. But we have tried both cases with wei value and with zero. Comparing with transfer functions of stable and gold contracts and request function of Attestation contract of Celo, the Java sdk for them is ignoring the wei value and it works. Also in the .sol files they are not marked with being payable.
undefined says @Tong | cLabs @Piersy  i've talked to you both! I'll leave you to set up a call between you two!
undefined says Hello everyone,
I need to create a contract that make recurring payments as per user's request. Right now, i can handle this if the sender or recipient calls the contract. However i was wondering whether Celo supports  contracts which calls my contracts at a particular time like ETH-Tempus/Aion in Ethereum. 
Ref: https://github.com/jfdelgad/ETH-Tempus/blob/master/README.md
undefined says I don't think anyone has deployed wither Tempus or Aion to Celo, but it seems like it would be fairly easy to do so. IIUC, this would require running an external service to execute the scheduled calls as well. I'm curious why you need a scheduled call, and if there is any way to avoid it, or implement a very simple version yourself. In most cases it should be possible, although it can alter the UX a bit.
undefined says I want to schedule the payment transactions of  monthly/yearly services as subscribed by the user. Instead of sender or recipient calling the contract functions every month, i am scheduling an operation to execute it every month/year. Why do you suggest avoiding this?
undefined says Hello @here
undefined says Anyone seen the Visa + USDC integration
undefined says ?
undefined says I was wondering if the same can be done with Celo Dollars considering Celo Dollars is a stablecoin too with the exception that is decentralized
undefined says There is a startup on the Celo Camp Pathway that wants to implement such a feature, to enable their users interact with their app using US Dollars and/or Euros(basically any fiat) but on the backend everything is ran in Celo Dollars and alternatively Celo Gold
undefined says I think the vote activation is an interesting one that would benefit from a feature like this. I have been thinking that it be nice to port such a project, i know yearn uses https://keep3r.network/
undefined says Yea i think their migrating keepers to Chainlink slowly.
undefined says On a similar is note, does the community have thoughts on how hybrid smart contracts could work with Celo?
undefined says Nice summary of Chainlink 2.0 where they break down how their approaching hybrid smart contracts https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/research-summary-chainlink-2-0-next-steps-in-the-evolution-of-decentralized-oracle-networks/300
undefined says Yea we had a chat to USDCs head of BD the other day re. USDC on Celo. Sounds like its in their roadmap and are hiring a team focused on multi chain USDC expansion - but its gonna take a few more months
undefined says I've found that since upgrading my full node from v1.1.1 to v1.2.5, I'm seeing transient periods of CPU spikes. They last an hour or two and seem to resolve themselves but during that time the node is unavailable. Has anyone else seen a similar pattern?
undefined says Logs attached of when the problem starts, which is followed by `Block state missing, rewinding further` spamming the logs for the duration of the incidents.
undefined says Celo guys I have a question:
We have been testing our code on Alfajores and everything works fine.
We have now moved to the Mainnet.
During a call to `stableToken.approve()` we are getting this error: `invalid sender`
Before this we have no problem checking the balance and it's positive.
Any ideas why this is happening? Or where we can investigate it further?
undefined says @YasharIsACapital  "invalid sender" suggests the signature isn't valid (the sender address is extracted from the signature).  If you run your code with DEBUG=* you can see more details about all the requests and responses.  But I would look into how the transaction signing is being done.  One cause of an invalid signature could be using the wrong network id in the signing data, but if you're using contractkit it should handle that automatically.
undefined says @Deleted User I am using the new Java SDK for Celo. I think there is a configuration problem. On the internet it says it could be due to invalid chain Id
undefined says @YasharIsACapital Yes, that's what I meant by "network id" above (chain id is a different name for the same thing).  I was not even aware there was a java SDK and am not familiar with its authors.  Looking at it, it seems to have hard-coded the Alfajores chain id, so it would only work on Alfajores and would certainly explain your error.  https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-java/blob/e188c2c21192e39b1cdf8dd2aa5a9800a8059782/src/main/java/org/celo/contractkit/ContractKitOptions.java#L10 . 

I don't know if there's a way to specify a chain id to overwrite that.  If so, the chain ids for the three networks can be seen at https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/079f42f05036ae961f0f8f8f8360b904159d3e5e/params/config.go#L36-L38
undefined says @Deleted User Thank you. Love you. With you the best time ever! 😆 👍 
Yes it can be configured.
undefined says Hi folks, I'd like to better understand the transaction fee <> security trade-off of Celo versus something like zksync on Ethereum. Could someone point me to some good high level reading on this topic? I'd like to understand the tradeoffs involved in gettinga $0.001 transaction fee. Thanks
undefined says Hey guys quick question is there a way to send ethcompatible transactions to Celo?
undefined says @kiems1 That comes with Donut activation, so for now only on Baklava.  You can do it metamask or other wallets which support adding custom networks, or if you want to do it from javascript then any ethereum tooling (e.g. web3) should work
undefined says We have not added support to contractkit for creating eth-compatible transactions
undefined says Is there any documentation on adding celo to metamask?
undefined says @Calico Kittencat Documentation is being worked on, but I can give you a quick rundown.  Are you interested in adding it as a user or as a dapp developer?
undefined says I’m having trouble passing the right parameters for the gateway fee it returns me an error saying it’s not the right format
undefined says User
undefined says @Calico Kittencat Here are the instructions for adding Baklava to metamask:
1. Go to Metamask settings, then to the "Networks" settings
2. Click on "Add Network"
3. Fill in the following values:
     - Network Name: Celo (Baklava)
     - New RPC URL: https://baklava-forno.celo-testnet.org
     - Chain ID: 62320
     - Currency Symbol: CELO
     - Block Explorer URL: https://baklava-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/
4. Press "Save"
5. The network should have been added to Metamask's network dropdown list
6. To add the cUSD and cEUR tokens on an account:
     - click on "Add Token" in the "Assets" tab.
     - Select "Custom Token"
     - Paste in the contract's address under "Token Contract Address"  (0x62492A644A588FD904270BeD06ad52B9abfEA1aE for cUSD and 0xf9ecE301247aD2CE21894941830A2470f4E774ca for cEUR)
     - The token symbol and "Decimals of Precision" should be filled in automaticaly
     - Press "Next", then "Add Tokens"
undefined says @kiems1 I don't follow.  If you want to create an eth-compatible transaction, you would be using ethereum tooling where the concept of gateway fee doesn't exist.  How are you trying this?
undefined says So when I tried sending a transaction using the standart eth tooling I was getting an error 
Saying I was missing some parameters 
Let me send you the error I’m getting now
undefined says Latest error msg is "json: cannot unmarshal hex number with leading zero digits into Go struct field CallArgs.gatewayFee of type *hexutil.Big"
Is there a way to invoke a standard ethereum compatible transaction through the RPC, maybe a different RPC method name than "eth_sendTransaction", or maybe an extra parameter im missing ?
undefined says @kiems1 normally you would generate and sign the transaction using the ethereum tooling and then use `eth_sendRawTransaction` (that's what wallets like metamask do).  If you want to use `eth_sendTransaction`, are you having the node sign the transaction for you?  If so, I don't see the motivation for using an eth compatible transaction, since you're not sending the node a signed RLP-encoded transaction in the first place.
undefined says Thank you so much!
undefined says @kiems1 As far as that error goes, I can certainly check it out if you DM me a code snippet.
undefined says Ohh I see what I was doing wrong now
undefined says Thanks Or!
undefined says I’ll try and let you know in case i get another error
undefined says @kiems1 sounds good!  And, for reference, you can see here an example of using eth-compatible transactions using web3: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/1dd2c3b26813a3dee77061a5d42c5b6c1e3bdeb2/packages/celotool/src/e2e-tests/cip35_tests.ts#L346-L357 .  It is using the web3 contained in contractkit since this is part of a suite of tests that include normal Celo transactions, but the same should work using just web3 without contractkit
undefined says Can I switch out the testnet for a mainnet RPC URL?
undefined says @Calico Kittencat Not until the Donut hard fork is activated on mainnet (May 19th).  (by which time we should have documentation ready for it as well)
undefined says Thank you very much, I thought that was the case but didn't know when.
undefined says Hi, Anyone knows how can i get back cello dollar tokens after sending it by mistake to celo address?
undefined says can you say more? what wallets are you using?
undefined says @aaron | cLabs | pretty clueless Hi, Aaron. I have made a stupid mistake by sending Celo Dollar from Coinlist to Celo address in Binance. I did that because it seems that on Coinlist you can change Celo to USDC but when i did the reverse process i only could choose Cello Dollar from the tokens available list
undefined says I was wondering if there is a way to recover those tokens. Already talked to Binance Support but they said that this token is not suported in Binance and for that they cannot help me. Coinlist did not gave me a answear yet.
undefined says I was hopin’ to find a solution within the community because the amount is important to me
undefined says If Binance controls the private key to the CELO address you sent to, then only Binance can send your cUSD back to you. CELO and cUSD addresses are one and the same. If you sent cUSD to a CELO address Binance controls the private key for then it is recoverable. The question is whether or not Binance is *willing* to get it for you.
undefined says Ok. I undestand. I will contact Binance support once again. From what you are saying, i should only hope for a solution from Binance and not Coinlist. Coinlist does not have any control over this situation?
undefined says I need to say that I appreciate very much the fact that you take time to explaine this to me.
undefined says Thank you very much for that.
undefined says I am not sure if this can help or not, but you are willing to take a look at the transaction if i gave you the Txn hash? Hope this is not too much to ask.
undefined says If the transaction was sent over the Celo network from a CoinList wallet to a Binance controlled wallet, then only Binance can access that cUSD. They are probably telling you they won't do it because they do not have cUSD listed as a trading asset and therefore sending the cUSD would be a manual/time consuming process for them.
undefined says Sure.
undefined says 0x1416935a09632b802e45e41039c4ce0f3998464f4c1621ab1e09ec7adc37b469
undefined says This is the hash
undefined says As you can see the transfer appears to be succesful but in binance address the tokens has not arrive
undefined says Agreed. The transaction was successful. Sorry there isn't much more I can do to help.
undefined says hi, is there any ERC20/ERC677 bridge running in the Celo mainnet?
undefined says Not yet, but there are teams working on building bridges to other ecosystem including:

- Bitcoin ($BTC) - built by keep.network
- Ethereum ($ETH): built by the summa.one team acquired by Celo Labs (cLabs) - wrapped wCELO & cUSD already available 
- Cosmos Hub ($ATOM): built by the interchain foundation
- Kadena ($KDA): built by Kadena
- Celo to Celo ($CELO): multiple Celo based chains can interoperate (similar to Cosmos SDK chains or Substrate chains). Built by ChainSafe Systems
undefined says Recently, there was an update between CELO and COSMOS:

https://twitter.com/CeloOrg/status/1389396237527437314?s=19
undefined says can I get in touch with the team building the ETH bridge?
undefined says point of clarification (in case others got confused) but wrappedEth on celo -- a trusted bridge-- is different than the work summa is doing -- trustless bridge.
undefined says Is someone here with knowledge of DEVp2p and if there have been any changes to the existing geth implementation? 
I have been wondering, since Kademlia does not have inherent sybil protection how the protocol deals with duplicate nodeIDs (not IP:port) in the triples `<IP, UDP port, nodeID>`
undefined says And as I remember correctly (and stated in the design rationale) the triple is more elaborate tuple containing the secp256k1 pubkey which also is used to sign the record
undefined says But what if two nodes join the network with access to the same sk to sign these "duplicates" (that only differ e.g. in IP address)
undefined says see https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/666828186570588161/839693253929992244
undefined says Do you happen to have the alfajores Metamask instructions? 🙏
undefined says @ChrisBattenfield  Same as above except some of the values are different:
```
     - Network Name: Celo (Alfajores Testnet)
     - New RPC URL: https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org/
     - Chain ID: 44787
     - Currency Symbol: A-CELO
     - Block Explorer URL: https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/
```
and the token addresses (which you can get via `celocli network:contracts`, but need to use proxy since that's where the storage is) are:
```
cUSD: 0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1
cEUR: 0x10c892A6EC43a53E45D0B916B4b7D383B1b78C0F
```
undefined says Hi everyone, I have an old question! Is it possible to make a contract pay for the transaction fee? I know it's not possible in Ethereum Solidity and it's only possible to make someone else pay the fee. But is it possible in Celo?
undefined says Short answer is, no, there are no extra features on Celo that allow for this yet. This is an issue we are actively investigating, because we plan to transition Valora to smart contract wallets, and because there are a _ton_ of use cases which can benefit from this. Here are some notes that I've taken so far on the topic, and if you've done any research into the topic I'd love to discuss https://www.notion.so/clabsco/Gas-Payment-26761c92e0b34eac911bdd12bdb3ec12
undefined says So basically was wondering where I can see code / demo of an optics communication between two chains. In the hopes of getting an idea to implement one.
relatively new to the blockchain space, but have been developing for a while. My main question/confusion right now is how do one send a message to the outside world from a smart contract. (I am guessing this is what chainlink does), but is there an example perhaps that someone could point me to where I could check out where an explicit call is made to the outside world
undefined says Potentially noob question: I want to execute EIP-2470, and I found a repo for deploying here: https://github.com/3esmit/ERC2470

I sent funds to the one-time use account and tried deploying the raw transaction. I got back an error message saying `"replay protection is required"`. As I understand it, replay protection is to prevent transactions from other chains to be re-executed on the current chain, and was enforced as part of CIP-35 (recent hardfork). Is this enforcement at the full-node level? Is it possible for me to remove that enforcement and run a full-node myself and have my custom full node broadcast the replayed transaction?

Thanks
undefined says follow up question: does it matter that the creator of the SingletonFactory contract is a single use address? Is there anything an owner of the contract can do to tamper with the state that any other user couldn't?
undefined says So the blockchain cannot make calls to the outside world. Instead, a node must poll the blockchain, and respond to information published. This is the task of the various off-active nodes (e.g. relayers, watchers, updaters) in the Optics system.
undefined says so if lets say I was connecting eth and ada networks, and I want the eth contract to poll the ada blockchain, doesnt that mean its still speaking to the outside workd
undefined says apologies if this sounds ignorant, trying to wrap my head around it 😅
undefined says Replay protection is an enforcement of EIP-155 signing. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md With the Donut hardfork, all nodes now enforce EIP-155 as the only way to sign transactions, so there is no way around it. You'll need to use an updated transaction signer, and specify the network ID.
undefined says Dug into this a bit more. I confirmed that EIP-155 is now strictly enforced [1], and it appears that EIP-155 must not be used in order to deploy to a fixed address, which is one of the main aims of EIP-2470. [2] So if your goal is to get a single address across multiple networks, it doesn't seem possible. (Or at least unless another method exists)

[1] https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/342c354ae2db346f2f90fbaba6fd6e66a3ae1fb7/core/state_processor.go#L110-L117
[2] https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2470#deployment-method
undefined says Both Eth and Ada and publishing data, but in the traditional sense, they are not exactly speaking to the outside world. Nodes polling the state or each, and pushing messages in response, are required to complete the connection. These nodes do facilitate a sort of "message sending" protocol, which as long as they are online, you can effectively "talk" between the chains.
undefined says And you shouldn't be concerned about asking a question. This is one the questions that took me a while to eventually understand.
undefined says any developers available for hire regarding celo optics? exciting project active and would love to grow our team. send me a mesage!
undefined says Any celo.projects that involve games. Would love to know more about them ?

undefined says Hello Everyone, 

Please we need some help,

We have this list of addresses which contains Cusd fund, but manually moving fund out them one after the 
other is a lot of stress, we want like a parent address, that can access all it child addresses, 
and send fund on behalf of it's children.

Thanks for helping us 🙏 !.
undefined says Do you already have these addresses with funds or are you planning for the future?
undefined says I have a question too, I need to query the last n token transfers to a certain wallet. Is it possible? How can I do this?
undefined says Thanks Yasharpm, this address are with funds, and we don't want this to occur again
undefined says How many addresses are we talking about here?
undefined says 500+
undefined says Do you have the private key for all the 500+? What is your use case?
undefined says Yes, we have the private key, they are escrow addresses
undefined says Hmm, but they are already claimed right? I mean you want to take fund from 500+ accounts? Or are they expired escrows that now you want to redeem?
undefined says Yes, we want to take fund from 500+ accounts
undefined says Doing this sweep at once
undefined says Then you probably need someone to write a code for you to transfer them all automatically while making sure nothing is left. I don't know if a solution can exist to resolve it for you in the future.
undefined says Ok Yasharpm, Thanks for your support🙏
undefined says No problem. I hope I could be of help 🙏
undefined says Hi everyone,

Please I need some help,

I tried sending an entire balance of cUSD from an address to another address, I got a txhash but it does not send the entire balance, and after some seconds I instantly got this error in the console.

Thanks!!🙏
undefined says

undefined says looking for a developer to complete this task. open to negotiation: https://github.com/vcdcvcdc/celo-optics/issues/1
undefined says Kindly reply to my message
undefined says I dont think Optics has launched yet so pretty sure all developers who know it are busy working on it.
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant I see a couple of problems: (a) you're using `parseFloat`, which is a big no-no, because the native javascript type isn't high enough precision for working with such large numbers (1 cUSD = 10^18 cUSD wei), so you should stick to the bignumber types or strings, (b) to calculate the amount to send, you did amount = balance - gasPrice, which isn't right.  The fee is gasPrice * gasLimit (well, if the tx uses less gas than the gas limit you get part of it back, but you must have that much since you first get deducted that much for the fee).  So the correct formula would be amount = balance - gasPrice * gasLimit.
undefined says Thanks so much🙏  @Deleted User, I followed your approach and I was able to almost send all the cUSD from the address, it just remaining 0.000050213711571367.
am wondering is their a way to get the gasLimit, instead of guessing the value to use as gasLimit, maybe a option just as we used to get a gasPrice?
undefined says If you're paying for gas with CELO, it should be possible to totally empty the cUSD balance. If you're paying with cUSD, it's very tricky to perfectly empty it. I haven't found a way for CeloWallet.app yet. If you figure one out please let me know!
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant You can get the gas limit using the `eth_estimateGas` RPC (which is in contractkit, though I don't remember the details).  But, if you then modify the amount sent, or there are other changes in the blockchain state that affect the transaction's execution, the gas actually used could be different.  But for simple transactions like cUSD transfers it should be reliable.  If you want to be extra safe you can do gas estimation first with an amount close to the balance, then adjust the gas limit and amount based on that, and do gas estimation again with those to check that it's still ok.
undefined says I've found even when you estimate gas and fetch the gas price for the exact tx, the fee estimates aren't exact for cUSD. Maybe something has improve with the getGasPrice RPC when querying with stablecoins? I haven't poked around there for a few months
undefined says The gas price minimum in cUSD depends on the CELO/cUSD exchange rate (since it's the CELO GPM converted to cUSD using the oracles' median rate).  However, if you specify the gas price yourself in the transaction then that won't change.  On the other hand, if you let contract kit the gas price for you, it will be based (5x iirc) on whatever the GPM in cUSD is at the time (which changes over time).  What can change is the actual amount of gas used.  If the transaction uses less gas than its gas limit, then the fee in the end will be based on the gas used rather than the gas limit.  Also, the GPM (apart from the conversion to cUSD) can change over time, but that doesn't change the gas price you set if you set it explicitly.
undefined says In tried using the estimatedGas, but I got this 
"insufficient funds for transfer (after fees)", if I should comment out the value in the transactionObject, the error goes away, please what am I doing wrong?
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant  You're trying to estimate gas for a CELO transfer rather than a cUSD transfer.  To estimate gas you can do something like:
```
await stable.methods.transfer(toAddr, amount).estimateGas({from: fromAddr})
```
Also, your `totalBal` is already in wei.  By calling toWei with it with "ether" you will the wrong amount (10^18 what you want)
undefined says Also, to do math with these numbers you should use the bignumber.js library.  What you're doing there for `deductTotalAndGas` is using javascript native types and so will involve rounding and not give you the exact values.
undefined says I tried calling the estimateGas from the stable method, but I got `Cannot read property 'transfer' of undefined`
undefined says That's true but IIUC, the estimateGas call doesn't take into account the cUSD transfers that happen when you pay for gas with cUSD. That's why the gas inflation factor for cUSD was initially introduced. Without a precise gas estimate, how can the exact fee be computed beforehand?
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant Sorry, my bad, that should be `stable.contract.methods.transfer`.   But also I now notice that if you want to pay the fee with cUSD you need to also include that in the estimateGas call (so add `feeCurrency: stable.address` in the parameters object for `estimateGas()`
undefined says @Rossy I'm not sure what you mean.  `estimateGas` does take into account the fee currency (by simulating the transaction using the fee currency specified), and gives a higher result when you specify a non-CELO fee currency.  However, I am seeing that the actual transaction ends up using a little less gas than the estimate.  But it seems to be peculiar to the cUSD contract or something else with my setup.  When I do a CELO transfer using cUSD for the fees, the estimate and the actual gas used agree (71,000).  Don't know why there is a discrepancy with the cUSD contract
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant That said, I'm not sure that trying to gather this "dust" (tiny residual balances) warrants so much effort on your part.  And I'm not 100% sure that getting it exactly may not be possible (in general it's definitely not possible, but for simple transaction types like cUSD transfers it might be)
undefined says Thank you so much 🙏  @Deleted User , for holding my hand all the way through, really learned a lot, We would let go of the dust value, must of the time it normally left with (0.0000581935819487 cUSD)
undefined says Thanks!! 🙏  @Rossy for contributing to the topic  😀
undefined says Hi everyone,

I tried exchanging cUSD to Celo using the @celo/contractkit, but I get this

`execution reverted: transfer value exceeded balance of sender`

I was able to do this successfuly using the @celo/celocli

Please I need some help,

Thanks!!🙏
undefined says Hi @Gabriel | Paychant
Two things
1) you also need to set the from option  in the `send` of the `exchange.sellStable` call. You have the option to set the `kit.defaultAccount` which will add that account as the from of every send. In this case `window.kit.defaultAccount = sender` at the beginning, for example
2) you are setting the feeCurrency with the stable token, so remember that you will need to have not only the funds to sell the token, but also the fees in that stable to pay for them
undefined says Thanks so much!!🙏  @Ponti | cLabs, it work perfectly now😀
undefined says Great! One more little detail to have a clearer code 😛 . If you use the `kit.setFeeCurrency` as you are doing, every tx from that moment will use that currency as default, so you can avoid to set those later in the `approve` and `sellStable`'s `send`.
You can use that empty `send()` which will use the default account and the feeCurrency that you've set 😄
undefined says And just another detail. Take in count that you are setting those defaults, in a global instance of the kit. So every other action from other function that does not set those two fields in the `send` action, will use the default you've added here (It's not something wrong, but just to take it in count to avoid bugs 😉 )
undefined says @joshc @medha @Ponti | cLabs @Mariano | cLabs  i was wondering if there are oracle services providing real world data to the Celo Blockchain
undefined says I wanted to get Weather Data(precipitation) onchain
undefined says i am not aware of any oracles that provide this data, but you could set up your own without too much difficulty. this guide is a great place to start https://medium.com/@pedrodc/implementing-a-blockchain-oracle-on-ethereum-cedc7e26b49e
undefined says Hi guys.. Does anyone know how to generate wallets from  Mnemonic Phrases?
undefined says @Juliandson Can you be more specific on what you're looking to do?  There are libraries in various programming languages that let you do that, as well as stand-alone software, such as https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ or even celocli's `account:new` command, and of course a user you typically let the wallet software (or a hardware wallet) do it for you
undefined says Okay!!, I got it now, thanks!
undefined says I often get this error when I try for the first time, but when I try the second time, it now works perfectly

`Gas estimation failed: Could not decode transaction failure reason or Error: execution reverted: transfer value exceeded sender's allowance for recipient`

Don't know what I might be doing wrong
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant are you using forno, or your own node?
undefined says > @Gabriel | Paychant are you using forno, or your own node?
@Ponti | cLabs 

Yes, am using the forno (alfajores)
undefined says I was asking because maybe it was sending the second request (well, no the second, but the one triggered after the approve tx, that uses the node to estimate the gas of the transaction) to another node, and as probably is depending on the pending state of the node, that's why I could fail. But I have to check that. I know that we have a known issue already fixed in our master branch that involves the pending state for the gas estimation.
undefined says If the issue is on that gas estimation, one thing that will probably work (as a workaround) is to fix the amount of gas required for that tx
undefined says In your case add to the selling gold line a fix gas amount:
`const sellTx = await exchange.sellStable(amountWie, goldToken).send({gas: 300000})`
undefined says @Gabriel | Paychant Check that out, and let me know if still happens to you. And sorry for the delayed answer 🙂
undefined says Thank you so much!! 🙏  @Ponti | cLabs for taking your time to make the detailed explanation.

I have updated the @celo/contractkit to the latest version as at today, and also tried setting the sellStable gas to 300000, 
I think everything now works well now, I tried exhanging many times and I never see the error again 😀
undefined says I was building a project for celo India Fellowship and faced an issue while calling a function in smart contract. The function in smart contract returns successfully when being deployed to ethereum(rinkeby) or ganache development environment. But when I deploy to celo alfajores network it returns error of "invalid opcode: opcode not defined 0x44"

undefined says @medha  @Ponti | cLabs @Mariano | cLabs
undefined says @joshc
undefined says @david_mitesh  we don't have the `block.difficulty` (that's the 0x44 opcode) that you are using to calculate a random
undefined says Wrong David 😉
undefined says hahaha sorry
undefined says @david_mitesh as an alternative for the rand, you can use the blockhash (in that same calc), or use one of our core-contracts, the Random.sol (https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Random.sol)
undefined says which you can consume from the registry
undefined says And, as an advise, I recommend not to use the difficulty or the blockhash to calculate a random. There's a lot of issues with that. The random contract should provide a better one
undefined says yeah I noticed that. After posting question here, I tried a lot and removed every part of contract to see what was causing the trouble. I removed the block.difficulty and then it finally worked. Then I googled and find out that block.difficulty is more specific to the chains that works on proof of work consensus.
undefined says ok thanks for the recommendation. I will implement this random contract. I was not aware about its existence.
undefined says Thanks a lot
undefined says @Mariano | cLabs @Joshua @victorgraf I've been looking at Tim Roughgarden's paper on EIP1-1559, and a few things have jumped out so far in relation to the idea of increasing Celo's target density from 0.5 to 0.75 or 0.8 or something in that vicinity:
(a) Our GPM adjustment calculation is different from theirs in terms of what the adjustment factor means.  In Ethereum the delta is relative to the gas target, while in our GPM contract the delta is relative to the gas maximum.  So, say the target density is `d` and the adjustment speed fraction is `s`, the maximum **upward** change in GPM (i.e. the change after a full block) for us would be `s(1-d)` while for Ethereum it would be `s(1/d-1)`.  In particular, with the parameters as is, it's `0.5(1-0.5) = 0.25` for us and `1/8*(2-1) = 0.125` for Ethereum.  
(b) If we increase to 0.75 and leave the adjustment factor at 0.5, then the maximum GPM increase per block would be `0.5*(1-0.75) = 0.125` which would then match the rate on Ethereum
(c) However, one thing I hadn't thought of before is called out in section 8.6.6. If the target density isn't 0.5, then bigger adjustments in one direction are possible than in the other (e.g. a full block would increase the fee by more than an empty block would decrease it), which makes it possible for a minority of validators to manipulate the base fee in one direction (up if the density is less than 0.5 or down if it's more than 0.5).  For example, with a target density of 0.75, 25% of miners could drive the base fee down by mining empty blocks even if all the other miners' blocks are full.  With a density of 0.8 it'd be 20%, and so on.
undefined says I didn't go through all the analysis of miner strategies, so I'm not sure what the implications of this would be, but I thought it was an interesting point we should take into account.  And, another caveat on the above is that perhaps the adjustment speed should be considered in relation to block time (with shorter block times you don't need as big an adjustment per block?  With the ethereum block time more than twice as long as Celo's, would 0.0625 be a closer equivalent for us?)
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hi. I'm using `mycelo` to start a single validator private network and using `load-bot` to fire transactions. Runs fine for few blocks and then encounters `Tried to insert duplicated produced block`. The block production stops. Restarting the validator node resumes production. 

Seems like the geth worker is producing duplicate blocks at same height. What can be the main reason for this? Too much load to process in the block period?
undefined says Hi @PB Having a look at the code it looks like it could be a lack of synchronisation around block insertion. Would you be able to share a log from a failed validator and also the commands you used to start the network and apply load so that we can investigate further?
undefined says ```
./mycelo genesis --newenv ~/celo-testing/envfolder --validators 1 --blockperiod 2 --buildpath ~/celo-testing/celo-monorepo/packages/protocol/build/contracts/

undefined says i am using "geth --alfajores console" this command to full node testnet but i am getting a error  "flag provided but not defined: -alfajores". Can anyone please me help me out with this.
undefined says Did you build or download the binary from https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain , or is it possible you are using the Ethereum build of Geth?
undefined says I have build by cloning this repo
undefined says my machine also have ethereum build of geth . Is it messing with celo? Actually I am new in this .
undefined says Glad you are checking it out! You will need to use the Celo build of Geth. You can get it through Docker, following these instructions https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/mainnet/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet, or build it from the celo-blockchain repository I linked above.

undefined says Guys, (@prestwich :)) we're trying to deploy the ERC1820 contract onto alfajores and forno, but no success so far
undefined says The signed transaction must be sent with the EIP-155 replay protection switched off in order to be the same to all networks
undefined says Do you know if there is a way to skip the replay protection check? Spinning up a celo node didn't seem to work, as apparently it doesn't accept eth-compatible transactions
undefined says anyone know how long a alfajores sync should take?
undefined says highlighting to @victorgraf
undefined says maybe someone could help me here also regarding why I need to run a node. Im trying to setup gnosis safe on alfajores, but the public rpc is refusing txs from the gnosis deployment scripts due to eip155
undefined says I assume the public rpc has `--rpc.allow-unprotected-txs` set to false
undefined says Since gnosis deployments are deterministic, using the same address across all chains, they have a presigned tx which they just publish when deploying, this transaction doesnt have the chainId, hence the refusal by the public alfajores rpc to accept the transaction.
undefined says Is anyone running a testnet node without eip155 which I can use just to deploy gnosis?
undefined says save me having to sync my own node
undefined says @AFM @! ⟠ ¡ dylkil Replay protection is required since the Donut hard fork (it was part of CIP-35), there is no way to bypass it.  This does mean you can't deploy contracts to the same address on Celo as on others chains.  It would be possible to make it optional again in a future hard fork, but that has not been considered afaik.
undefined says ok, so no ERC-1820 on Celo for now
undefined says tks
undefined says unfortunate, thanks @oneeman
undefined says guys, another quick question - is there a tutorial somewhere on how to verify contracts on celo explorer?
undefined says Hey, I want to run node.
Anybody help me, as a node operator what are the things I have to do?
Fulfill any jobs or what..
undefined says Hi, glad that you're interested in running a node. You can find the detailed documentation here https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/mainnet/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet
undefined says I checked it, but there is no info 'bout, what to do after configuration. 
It's my first time running a node so plzz help me😅
undefined says Hello THEkay, 
After starting the node, you will see that you are syncing with the network and receiving blocks. This is the sign that you are all set.
undefined says If you are looking to run a  validator node, we've got a detailed video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eusVhYgm6sI
undefined says For a Full node in VM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8qAISLJZq8
undefined says Thank U so much 😄
undefined says You're welcome, this one is good too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdYaO0ha2gM
undefined says Yeah I just watched this one

One question I want to ask
What if my node goes down or off for some hours?
undefined says Then it will have to resync with the blockchain when it is back online, that's why node operators use VMs on the cloud so that the service is uninterrupted.
undefined says Okay..
undefined says Not sure if this is the place for this but DIA doesn't have an oracle deployed on testnet. Anyone know of any better oracle providers for celo?

Do you have any update on this ?
undefined says Hi 
I was trying to set up a 3 node local network with mycelo using kubernetes
Can anyone help with that?
undefined says Any specific challenge that you can into?
undefined says I wanted to know are there any yamls present or anyway I can setup a private local network using kubernetes which I can reuse?
Or do I need to start from scratch?
undefined says Let me highlight it to @Rossy He will be in a better position to answer this, Couldn't find anything about it on the docs.
undefined says There are helm charts in the monorepo which can be used to set up k8s based networks but that’s not really my area of expertise so not sure I can help with that
undefined says Does anyone know how many blocks per year there are on celo?
undefined says Block time on Celo is 5 seconds, so yearly it would be around 6311390 blocks
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Excuse me, how is this data calculated
undefined says Celo uses  Address-Based Encryption. 
You can read the details here https://celo.org/papers/Celo__A_Multi_Asset_Cryptographic_Protocol_for_Decentralized_Social_Payments.pdf
undefined says What  CELO’s block size?
undefined says Is there a reales document?
undefined says Sure https://docs.celo.org/overview
undefined says 20M if you are asking for the max gas
undefined says I'm interested in the block size in bytes.
undefined says well, that is really tied to the amount of txs, and the amount of gas that every tx consume
undefined says What’s the Max, what’s the average? How can I make the calculations myself? Im interested into sizing.
undefined says https://stats.celo.org/
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org
undefined says Really really really rough numbers, haha
an empty block:
738 bytes  https://explorer.celo.org/blocks/7000825/transactions
This is basically the common data for every block, signatures, etc
The most basic tx (celo tx)
Block: 859 bytes, 21k gas https://explorer.celo.org/blocks/7000820/transactions So, 121 bytes for the tx
filling the entirely block, with that kind of txs, you'll have 115192 bytes just of the txs. So, the entire block should be 115930 bytes.
But this scenario covers just the cheaper tx filling the block. Every other tx, making a contract call, will add more data because the tx will have more info, but, it will also consume more gas. So you will need a more real scenario.
You can check the blocks we are generating here: https://explorer.celo.org/blocks
Right now, we are on average of 20k bytes for ~15% of the block, which could translate to a full block size of ~130k bytes. But again, it's heavily tied to the txs in the block
undefined says Awesome. Thx for that. Let me do my calculations with that and get back if anything. I understand the txs variation.
undefined says websocket on forno.celo.org is non responsive. does anyone know anything about that?
undefined says Highlighting to @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says @speculator  One of our team members was working on that fix. Are you still having that issue?
undefined says Is there a status page to see the latest official health of forno?
Also can we have a backup alternative to forno for redundancy? Not having the websocket API is quite limiting for many apps.
undefined says It's not on our explorer https://explorer.celo.org/ 

Maybe some of the devs @here can guide you
undefined says Figment has a pretty generous free tier for backups if you check out their DataHub service
undefined says @RAinUsTa i don't believe there's a status page
undefined says you can technically build one by just pinging the endpoint every few seconds to see if you get a 200 or not
undefined says except just pinging it yourself doesn't prove that the service is indeed disrupted at the provider side, vs connectivity issue from the client side.

Figment doesn't work because it requires identity verification to get an account, no anon access to their API.
undefined says can't you just do a check where you ask for the latest block on Forno, compare to explorer block and compare that timestamps of the latest block is about 5 seconds block time
undefined says that should prove that you are getting the latest block from Forno within the expected amount of time
undefined says You're talking about the HTTP api, which didn't go down, I'm concerned about the WS api which did go down for days
undefined says yeah we are rebooting the system for websocket, lemme get a status update
undefined says When the HTTP API fails, it fails in a very visible and loud way, because lots of other dependent pages start breaking.

When the WS api hangs or runs out of conns or w/e, it's more subtle, and Forno's infra monitoring isn't catching it until apps in the community start breaking.
undefined says WS is back online now, but my concerns are:
- official status page with monitoring and the official word on API health (http & ws)
- alternative to forno, for example, if someone from community is willing to bear the infra cost and run another set of loadbalanced API servers, where can we publish the full list of "somewhat trustworthy" public API servers for people to use
undefined says Started a thread.

undefined says I am new to this,  I have  a silly question. Does anyone know what's difference between non-ReleaseGold and ReleaseGold validators?
undefined says This might be useful for the info https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/release-gold
undefined says Thanks, I've red this before, but for validators. What is  the different?
undefined says I mean `Registering as a Validator (Non-ReleaseGold)` vs `Registering as a Validator (ReleaseGold Registration)`
undefined says That's my understanding as well.  New validators on Celo start with the Non-ReleaseGold instructions for validating. ReleaseGold is used by validators that need to distribute CELO staking rewards to the delegators/beneficiaries who participate in voting and POS concensus.
undefined says Hi Ponti,  what is the current TPS for the Celo network?
undefined says Thank you Ezra, Does that means Non-ReleaseGold validator can not vote and get rewards from the network?
undefined says Maybe @Ponti | cLabs can shed some more light on this when he is around. Meanwhile, let me check for more details on it too.
undefined says hi, i am trying to send some cusd in alfajores testnet, and get my transaction reverted, seems that internally, i am sending to 2 additional address in my transaction, as i am sending all the balance, i guess sending additional fund is the cause of the error. could someone explain me why this is happening and how should i solve this
this is my transaction
https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/0x2070fba5ee8afcace138b7a2a1e501674600ad1382dfd899c91d793ece03786d/token-transfers
undefined says and i have tested to send fund with at least 0.01 cusd kept in the sender wallet, and worked... could someone explain the reason behind this?
undefined says Highlighting to @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says @kkx  You are setting the gas limit very high (10M gas).  With your gas price of 1 gwei that means the maximum fee would be 0.01 cUSD, and that would not leave enough in the account for the transfer of 0.02 cUSD, which is why the transaction reverts.  The way it works is first the maximum possible fee is deducted, then it executes the transaction, and then you get refunded for the leftover gas.  But in this case because your gas limit is so high, what gets deducted for the fee doesn't leave the account the 0.02 cUSD necessary for the transfer.  Try setting the gas limit to something more reasonable like 200k gas.  Or pay the fee in CELO instead of in cUSD (since then the fee portion wouldn't affect the balance available for the cUSD transfer), but even then I'd recommend using a reasonable gas limit.  Normally whatever tool you're using should set the limit using gas estimation.  Though the explorer says your fee was in CELO, but I think that's wrong, since those two transfers there are the fees and they say cUSD.
undefined says Thanks,  i thought i was using celo to pay the transction fee. however now i have changed to use celo to pay the fee in alfajores but i am getting the following error: 
 'non-whitelisted fee currency address'

I have configured the fee token using this from sdk doc:
    celo_token = kit.base_wrapper.create_and_get_contract_by_name('GoldToken')
    kit.wallet_fee_currency = celo_token.address

and checked that celo_token address is this one, which is the one in alfajores.

undefined says What about the ease of porting applications from another blockchain? And what is the name of the language in which your blockchain is written? does he look like "solidity"? how easy is it for developers to learn it?
undefined says Hello Ilya, thanks for your interest in Celo. I'm highlighting this to @Ponti | cLabs . You will get some information soon.
undefined says I looked at your transaction using `eth_getTransactionByHash`, and confirmed you used cUSD for the fee.  Anyway, to use CELO for the fee, you have to set the fee currency to nil (null or undefined if using javascript), not to the CELO token's ERC-20 contract address.  CELO is treated differently for this because it's the blockchain's native asset.
undefined says @kkx I filed an issue about the explorer showing the wrong fee currency in its github repo: https://github.com/celo-org/blockscout/issues/401. cc @Valentin | cLabs
undefined says Thanks!
undefined says 😆
undefined says Did you find the answer?
undefined says I don't know if I'm totally understand the question
Everyone can lock and vote.
The releaseGold contract, allows you, to lock and vote (if the flags were set) with celo that you don't own yet. It's like a benefit, in a way. Otherwise every ReleaseGold contract is removing a big part of the voting power
undefined says Depends a lot on which kind of txs you are executing, and the amount of gas that they require.
In the maths I did before, basically took the native transfer which costs 21k gas, and divided the max block (right now 20M) by that number which gives you ~952 txs per block (5s). So with that specific tx filling the block, you can have ~190 tps.
But again, depends a lot on which txs you are executing
undefined says We are evm compatible, and our contracts use solidity, yes.
undefined says @here Vitalik Buterin is speaking now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeB42oqQ_lo
undefined says I am using python sdk and i managed to set fee currency to None, but got this error 
Error while send transaction: Error while construct transaction: Can't construct transaction without fee currency, set fee currency please
any hints for python sdk user?
undefined says @kkx Not familiar with that sdk, so you should ask whoever created or maintains it
undefined says Oh, cool, thanks, Or.
undefined says How light client in celo get synced with the full blockchain?
undefined says In the celo documentation there is distinction between Validators and full node...is it the case that Validators doesn't host the blockchain only the full node host the blockchain?
undefined says Highlighting to @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says @Tahlil to make it simpler, a validator is a full node that was elected to propose blocks, and via consensus with the other validators accept blocks and add those to the chain. A full node (non elected), the only thing that can't do, is add new blocks to the chain. Both stores the full blockchain data, verifies all new blocks and states, and maintain the state of the blockchain.
We have two different kind of light nodes: light node, and lightest node
The light node basically stores and sync the header chain, which allows that node to verify the validity of the data using the states roots that has in the headers. So, it request anything else if it's needed for specific operations.
The lightest node, takes the advantage that we know that the same validator's set will be the one signing (at least 2/3 +1 of the signatures) each block. So tecnically, instead of retrieving every header, you can just retrieve the epochs changes, where the old validator set, signs the new one for that new epoch, which allows us to "jump" that amount of blocks (each epoch ~17k blocks), because you can verify those signatures. After that node reaches the actual epoch, it syncs header by header until being up to date with the blockchain. But as the light node, it does not store the whole blockchain, and will have to retrieve info from the other full nodes for specific requests, and then can verify the validity of the data, with the state roots of the header
undefined says Hello all..Is anyone aware about the algorithm used for signature aggregation in Celo. ?
undefined says Hello Harsh, someone will answer your question soon.
undefined says Hello there
undefined says I have a question Please
undefined says Is Celo a Fork of Ethereum ?
undefined says ~~No it is not a fork of ETH~~
undefined says Can you please explain me this. I am so confuse. Not a tech guy
undefined says It used ETH Go Lang Client however CELO is a separate Layer 1 blockchain with several significant changes.
undefined says What is ETH Go Lang Client ?
undefined says I saw a Video with a Celo ambasador For the spanish comunity And she says Celo Is a Fork of ethereum. And since I Know Celo is Way different she confused me
undefined says Any nice decentralised wallet that I can use ?
undefined says Kinda want to be able to buy coins without having to give my id details!
undefined says Sure you can use the CELO wallets https://celo.org/dapps
undefined says Hey guys.. Anyone know what happenned to the alfajores websocket(wss://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org/ws).. I was connecting.. Now i cant..
undefined says Highlighting to @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says @Juliandson we were making some changes in the load balancer. While we fix that, you can use the `wss://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org/` url which I've checked that works
undefined says Well, it works right now, haha (It was faster than I thought)
undefined says Hey guys, Is it possible to stake celo within a smart contract?
undefined says You can stake via CeloWallet. Send further related questions to #🏠︱general
undefined says Thanks
undefined says hello! just read the celo whitepaper, very excited 🙂

have you guys thought about how to scale? are there plans to roll out your own L2 solution?
undefined says how can i swap from mainnet to celo and back? when i want to move stable coins or eth in and out?
undefined says Hi, we have the optics bridge for ETH, you can join us on #🌉bridging
undefined says can you post me URL to optics bridge?
undefined says https://mobius.money/
undefined says I followed instructions from this great video. It seems the procedure has since changed a little on docs.celo.org

There is no more Node configuration before the start. So I followed instructions from docs and typed : "docker run --name celo-fullnode -d --restart unless-stopped --stop-timeout 300 -p 127.0.0.1:8545:8545 -p 127.0.0.1:8546:8546 -p 30303:30303 -p 30303:30303/udp -v $PWD:/root/.celo $CELO_IMAGE --verbosity 3 --syncmode full --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpcapi eth,net,web3,debug,admin,personal --light.serve 90 --light.maxpeers 1000 --maxpeers 1100 --etherbase $CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --datadir /root/.celo --nousb"

Unfortunately no output is presented but the instance is up and running. Docs say that I should see outputs like this "INFO [07-16|14:04:24.924] Imported new chain segment               blocks=139  txs=319 mgas=61.987 elapsed=8.085s mgasps=7.666 number=406  hash=9acf16…4fddc8 age=6h58m44s cache=1.51mB"

undefined says Hello, i would like to make an API call (GraphiQL) with the Blockscout exploder. It is posible to query the total transactions by day?
undefined says This might help https://medium.com/@pedrodc/implementing-a-blockchain-oracle-on-ethereum-cedc7e26b49e
undefined says Thanks for the fast reaction. Honestly, this is too complicated for me. I need some JSON data to import in Power BI. I need an API url or some GraphiQL code to extract the total transaction by day to start with.
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs  will be in a better position to guide you.
undefined says If you run a docker command with the `-d` flag, you are basically detaching it from the terminal (which is also good, don't get me wrong) so it won't be showing anything to that terminal because it will be "running on background".
I don't know your level with docker, but here you have two options. You can run it without that `-d` flag and see everything BUT when you close that terminal the node will also shutdown. Or, keep it this way, but in one terminal attach yourself to the container running and check the logs (this second one, will require you a little more knowledge on docker)
undefined says I'm not that into details of what we are serving with graphiql, but you can check this console: https://explorer.celo.org/graphiql which can give you a hint of what resources you'll have
Maybe @Valentin | cLabs could help you a little more with the things you can query.
undefined says Are you running a fastSync?
undefined says @Sheep2Moon also (don't know why I didn't start with this, hahaha), in the folder that you used to mount the volume you will have a `log.txt`, that you can `tail -f` or whatever other tool that you use to see logs with.
So, in our case that you run that command with `$PWD` for the volume, in that folder you will probably have a `datadir` with a `log.txt` inside that will show you the logs
undefined says Thank you for your help @Ponti | cLabs I will try this. I'm a complete newbie so I way ask other basic questions here 🙂
undefined says Great! Don't worry, we are here to spread knowledge 😛
undefined says Hey @harsh_mashru sorry I didn't see this earlier. Celo uses BLS signature aggregation (with a PoK scheme to prevent rouge key attacks). Doing a quick search, section 1 of this page gives a description of the method we use. https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/BLSmultisig.html (This page goes on to describe a further modification that we do not use in Celo. Instead we use the first defense the article mentions, requiring a PoK showing the signer (i.e. validators) knows their secret key)
undefined says How do validator incentives work? Are they are getting fees + emissions in stable coins?
undefined says Hello
undefined says Can anyone help me?

undefined says Hi I try to run Celo full node on AWS, but it still loading the blocks; how long will it take for the node to completely synced. My AWS instance is t2.large
undefined says Thanks for sharing the message here, someone from the team will get back to you.
undefined says 💯 💯
undefined says Hey peeps,

We have a smart contract that we'd like to load with some CELO incentives.
Our smart contract is expecting an ERC-20 token for this. But if I understood correctly, CELO itself isn't one. (or it's some hybrid form?).

Is there a wrapped version of CELO (on the Celo network) available that we can use? Similar to how Polygon has the wrapped MATIC token (WMATIC), or Ethereum has WETH.
undefined says Alternatively, in case that CELO in itself already is an ERC-20 token:  can anyone point me to the contract address?
undefined says The documentation that I found is not very clear on this, except for:
``In Celo, CELO has a duality as both the native currency and an ERC-20 compliant token on the Celo blockchain.``
undefined says You should be getting a reply shortly
undefined says Ok thanks. Is it this one by any chance? https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x8dd4f800851Db9DC219fdFaEB82F8d69e2B13582/contracts
undefined says I thought you were looking for the ERC20 version. This is the contract

https://explorer.celo.org/tokens/0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438/token-transfers
undefined says Thanks allot 😍
undefined says Regarding CELO having such duality (native token and ERC20), it seems that if we send CELO to a contract, and the contract doesn't have a `payable` function, the transaction reverts - different than if we sent another ERC20 token to the contract which doesn't require a `payable` function.

PS: the behavior above I got when trying to send CELO to a contract without a `payable` function. Funds being sent from Celo Extension Wallet to a contract.

Does the contract really need to have a payable function or is there any workaround to receive CELO as a ERC20 and not the native token?

https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0x7e4af3fbd9405536854ad2b5a7b413ef3b5913e4f27a56f4ae061074995cdcdf/token-transfers
undefined says Highlighting this to @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says Thank you..That was a great help.!
undefined says Hello! Is there any AccountProxy and ReleaseGoldProxy in Alfajores like in the mainnet? Plus, It'll be nice to add contract name in alfajores testnet so that people can search contracts in celo explorer. @Arrow
undefined says You can increase the allowance in the celo erc20 contract of the user address for your contract address. And then from your contract trigger the transfer and do whatever you want.
undefined says The account contract (at least the one we are using, maybe you are referring to another one), has one instance, and that means that we have only one proxy that you can find in the RegistryContract (always in the `0x0...0ce10` address)
You can check the contract addresses using the celocli
`celocli network:contracts --node https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org`
which in this case, the account contract, has 
Proxy: 0xed7f51A34B4e71fbE69B3091FcF879cD14bD73A9
Impl: 0xd4aC632E0e3DE81DC565b402a99210C5b31271a0

As the ReleaseGold is not a unified contract for all, you will have a different proxy, for every RG contract instance. @Valentin | cLabs is there a way to find one using the explorer?
undefined says Ok, seems like we found a workaround!
First adding CELO as a token in Metamask in the assets list (``0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438``), and then sending it.
That works 🙂
undefined says Might be handy for other people running into the same problem!
undefined says Oh! Thanks! 😻😻😻
undefined says @Arrow, I've deleted the msg from #🏠︱general and moved it here as it seems more appropiate. Also tagging in @yaz and @Ponti | cLabs 

It has been a long-outstanding problem in DeFi as how to use stablecoins in consensus. You cannot simply replace "proof-of-stake" with "proof-of-stablecoin-deposit" due to security implications.

However, this is a much desired feature as it creates continuous built-in demand for the stablecoin, boosting liquidity, increasing price of the crypto-collateral and making things more stable overall. On top of this, it is the first time in history that we can have a decentralised provision of a risk-free interest rate (not by a Central Bank). 

The importance of a decentralised risk-free rate has been overlooked thus far. In our modern economy, it is foundational to our fractional reserve system, as a means to regulate the amount of debt. This can possibly be an avenue towards fractional reserve ontop of stablecoins, a massive boost in adoption (can finally potentially do mortgages, and large loans of stablecoins).

My co-founder and I at Cambridge Cryptographic have a solution outlined here (would love to chat with researchers/developers at Celo more):

undefined says Hello guys, can some help me out here, for the past few days when trying to connect to forno's websocket to listen for latest transactions, i keep getting this error, which sometimes breaks my app  `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: StableToken not yet deployed for this chain`
undefined says any help would be appreciated
undefined says @Umar a few questions. Which chain are you using? (alfajores, baklava, mainnet) This is happening when you use the contract kit, right? Which version of the CK do you have?
undefined says mainnet
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs Mainnet.. `"@celo/contractkit": "^1.2.0"`
undefined says could this be the issue?
undefined says mmmmm, it shouldn't
There is a preload of some contracts to have some configs. This particular issue is that basically is not getting the "StableToken" address from the registry which shouldn't be the case because we are having stable transfers in mainnet, haha.
Some of those addresses are cached. Is your tool running from a while?
undefined says Just to be sure i have same data, could you paste the TOKEN address for cUSD and cEUR
undefined says ```
StableToken          proxy 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a impl 0x2c4C1F3E06d494Bcc03E93b373637Cc4333CBd7D
StableTokenEUR       proxy 0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73 impl 0x665CB564390741783d78813445BD3C2eE1A60B78
```
the proxy one should be the address
undefined says hmmmm.... 😒
undefined says (a quick tip) you can check the address of the contracts using the command:
`celocli network:contracts --node https://forno.celo.org`
undefined says are you changing something from the CK, o just started to fail?
undefined says it just started to fail...
undefined says i think i will change my implementation of how i listen for transactions on the network..
undefined says first of all, how do i get the full abi of the cUSD contract using celocli? if it's possible
undefined says mmmm, not using celocli
you have the abi in the CK (contractkit/src/generated/<contract>)
undefined says one quick thing that you can check is if the last version has some sort of issue
fix the version for the ck to the previous one
`"@celo/contractkit": "1.2.4"`
undefined says if that one works, it means that the `.5` added a bug
undefined says ok.. let me try that...
undefined says let me know if that worked
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs forno.celo.org wss service is currently down.

undefined says but websocket on alfajores connects without any issues...
undefined says any help here?
undefined says i thought it was just me
undefined says nope. not just you. went down earlier in the month too.
undefined says use `wss://gala.now.im/ws` as a community run backup for now until forno wss is back
undefined says @Umar @speculator are you using `wss://forno.celo.org/ws`?
I'm not seeing any issue
undefined says yup..
undefined says thanks... this works flawlessly
undefined says if you go to "https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester"
undefined says and type in `wss://forno.celo.org/ws`
undefined says to test
undefined says it will show that its unable to connect
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs i think whatever health checks that are in place for the forno WSS is still not accurate
undefined says @RAinUsTa 
```
- Connection log will appear here
- Connecting to: wss://forno.celo.org/ws
- Connection established
```?
undefined says 
undefined says It could be a network carrier issue
undefined says mmmmmmm, maybe is node location, let me raise that
undefined says some IPs can connect, some IPs got blacklisted or something
undefined says is forno behind Cloudflare?
undefined says Cloudflare periodically will block off IP ranges when it suspects attack
undefined says btw, im checking from Comcast residential IP address
undefined says we have multiple clusters of forno, to make it faster for all around the world
undefined says okay, im in california bay area
undefined says I'm in Argentina, haha. Probably we are using a different clusters. Let me raise this
undefined says if there are health checks for forno wss, the healthchecks would need to run globally in different locations to hit different forno clusters
undefined says if the health checks are always coming from the same region, it wont provide coverage for other global forno clusters
undefined says for what I understand, we are checking every cluster. But I'm checking why we are not having this as an alert (maybe a miss config somewhere)
undefined says just for reference I am in Nigeria....
undefined says I don't know if that helps
undefined says It helps, thanks. I'm looking this up
undefined says a statuspage.io for forno would also go a long way so dapp developers dont second guess themselves
undefined says @RAinUsTa @Umar can you check now?
undefined says Hey, I want to use typesafe bindings to given contracts. With geth, I typically use `solc`+`abigen` to codegen those. However, I have just noticed that there is a quirk in the `accounts/abi/bind` module. Celo has replay protection enabled, which means there should be a wrapper to the transaction signer function that includes a `chainId` . However, the `bind` module as it stands does not offer the utilities to create "Transactors" (`TransactOpts`) that features these chainIds. 

Now, I have noticed that there's a `bind_v2` that implements some of the logic but isn't fully featured. This isn't exactly ideal because the abigen will generate bindings referring the `bind` package and in particular the API exposed in `auth.go`
undefined says wss is back

undefined says @Adriana your help is needed here..
undefined says basic question: I would like to sign my transactions with my private key with celocli but I don't see this option, what are the steps to follow ?
undefined says I can create a new account with `celocli account:new` then how can I sign transactions or import it into a Celo node?
undefined says I use `celocli config:set --node=https://forno.celo.org`
undefined says yes, but you should remove the "admin,personal,debug" api to make your node safer, you would also need to set up Nginx with SSL cert and the proper `/ws` forwarding for websocket upgrade to the 8546 websocket port
undefined says its also easier if you set flags `--ws --wsaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpcvhosts '*' --wsorigins '*'`
undefined says @kewl Add `--privateKey [your private key]` to the cli command you want to do, to use that private key to sign transactions.
undefined says Thanks @RAinUsTa
undefined says I'm running two Celo full nodes for gala.now.im, and one problem I experience is that periodically, the state database grows unreasonably large, and I have to take down one of the node to wipe the state db & reconstruct from the archive (e.g. removedb, delete local state, keep archive, reinitialize fast sync)

This seems annoying and geth has an offline snapshot prune command. Is there a way to port this snapshot prune command over to celo?
undefined says I have a problem when migrate
```truffle migrate --network alfajores```
It displays error 
```"Migrations" -- invalid argument 0: json: cannot unmarshal invalid hex string into Go value of type hexutil.Bytes.```
undefined says I have had the same issue, to work around this I downgraded to truffle 5.4.0
undefined says `sudo npm install -g truffle@5.4.0`
undefined says We are close to finishing a big upstream update, which will set us in the go-ethereum v1.10.7. As they have two forks there, this would require a fork from our side which we are estimating to be on ~January. Everything will be notified soon. This will cover the snapshot prune.
On the other hand I'm curious about the "state database grows unreasonably large". This is just for the snapshots part?
undefined says Hey @Mariano | cLabs , I have posted a ticket for my issue above. I found the `bind_v2` module but noticed that it doesn't implement EIP155 signing. See: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/1709
undefined says i've disabled snapshots for now to not use the extra disk space. periodically, I take down one of the two full-nodes in the pair and wipe & re-do fast sync starting from archive as a ghetto way to reset disk usage.
In my configuration, I'm using HA proxy in front of the pair to handle maintenance downtime. Having the snapshot prune offline command would reduce the maintenance window I need.
undefined says Heyo! I'm trying to start a celo oracle. To do so I'm looking to retrieve my private key for an alfarojes account in order to provide it as an env variable for the oracle config as mentioned in the celo oracle. The oracle is throwing an error when I pass the path to the keystore file of the data-dir (a json object containing address, blspublickey, crypto etc.) generated when creating a new account. Where can I find the private key to pass to the oracle?
undefined says If I understood you correctly, this should help: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/47031/how-to-decrypt-private-key-form-keystore-file-without-using-third-party-applica
undefined says If you're using Go, you can do this using the `account/keystore` methods. The keystore file is encrypted by default, even if the passphrase is `""` . To extract the private key, you need to decrypt it.
undefined says Hi, I'm trying to make Delegating DApp. How can I automate the process that user's activating process? (The rule in delegating user must activate their vote after one epoch)
@Ponti | cLabs
undefined says @Deleted User is not after an epoch, is just the next epoch, so it could eventually be less that 1 day (you can check in which epoch you are right now). Don't really know how other projects are handling this, but as a tip, remember that anyone could activate votes (there is a `activateForAccount` function in the `Election` contract. So, you can do a lot from there. (These are random ideas) Cron job activating every of your users account (this would require a server or something). Maybe deploy a contract were everyone of your users vote and then saves their group+account to be activated, but then as part of the same call, activate someones else. Or even having a contract where you save group+account, and gave other users a little incentive to active other votes. Or trigger some sort of reminder in your app, that allows the user to active their own votes.
Probably you can ask in the #🏠︱general to check how other projects did that
undefined says Thank you so much for your help!!!!!!👼🏻
undefined says Hey @Ponti | cLabs just curious if you know who is the best person to reach out to in order to discuss this issue. I'd be happy to help get a fix rolled out (included a quickfix in my issue)
undefined says @erwan I've just seen your issue and has a lot of sense, thanks for bringing this. I'm raising this to our internal channel, and let you know the next steps (and mariano is returning next week, he was on vacations)
undefined says ❤️ thanks, appreciate it. Happy to help this push across the finish line if there's an API you want to see in particular and make a PR out of it

undefined says Hey there! Has anyone managed to deploy on Celo using brownie?
undefined says The `celocli` tries first to sign the `tx` locally firt, but if it does not have a way to sign that, just forwards the tx to the node, expecting that the node has the way to sign it.
In this particular case, you are not setting for the `celocli` a way of signing the `tx` for the address `0xdcb6702936a4C257c7e715BF780925a93B217e37` so it forwards that to the forno node, which is a public node, and it does not store any address pk to sign (forno searches for that address for possible signers and fails with an `unknown account`)
Try to add some of the flags that the `celocli` has to specify signers (for example, `--useLedger`, `--privateKey`, `--useAKV`)
undefined says Hello, does anyone happen to have any experience creating Oracles for http requests on Celo? I am attempting to use Provable (http://docs.provable.xyz/#background) to oraclize a GET request, but it does not seem to be compatible with Celo. If anyone has any experience with Provable or creating http oracles on Celo, please let me know. Thank you.
undefined says Anyone? 🙂
undefined says Hello, I'm a begginer in celo.
I want to know that how can we verify signature in celo??
can somebody help me on this??
undefined says Hope the doc helps  https://docs.celo.org/overview
undefined says Hello, are there any docs or examples for directly playing with the full node/ ultralight image ?
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-full-node-in-baklava
undefined says Thanks Lynn, but I meant like playing with the node, not setting up, I'm guessing celo-cli docs is the only way, I'll just have to run different commands ?
undefined says I haven't tried brownie, but you should be able to set up a connection to a Celo network endpoint and it should work since Celo accepts ETH style transactions. were you able to get it working?
undefined says Is there any way to call smart contract from Rust?
I see we have built ContractKit in js, similar version is available in rust?
undefined says found this one: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs
undefined says Is there a demo of Optics already implemented?
undefined says Can I deploy my own Optisc on Celo?
I am developing a DEFI project on Celo that needs to use a cross-chain bridge, how should I use Optisc?
undefined says Is delegation on Baklava the same as delegation on Celo? I can't find anything in the docs about it. To be more specific - do Baklava tokens require the same 24 hour lock-up period before delegation and voting?
undefined says @0xTung probably you should ask that in the #🌉bridging channel
undefined says @moth if you are asking about the vote activation, the Election contract requires that passes at least 1 epoch change. So, technically it could be less than 24hs, and both baklava and alfajores, have the same amount of blocks between epoch's changes (17280 blocks at 5s per block, 24hs)
undefined says Does stopping the vote also take 3 days?
undefined says After the 24 hours, is the voting process the same on Baklava as it is on Celo?
undefined says @moth  That is a settable parameter and both baklava and alfajores, have that set to 6 hours
you can check the network paramenters using these commands from celocli
`celocli network:parameters --node https://baklava-forno.celo-testnet.org`
`celocli network:parameters --node https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org`
(same for mainnet, of course)
`celocli network:parameters --node https://forno.celo.org`
undefined says The other, the vote activation, is not a settable one, that's why I pointed that out. We require an epoch change because we require that at least 1 election has been held
undefined says Is selecting a validator group the same as mainnet as well?
undefined says yes from what I understand
undefined says Thank you. This was helpful!
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs Can you explain to me the relationship between the address lesser and address greater parameters and vote function?
undefined says The lesser and greater addresses are basically to maintain a sorted list. You are in a way, telling the contract in which place will be the group you are voting, pointing out the "surroundings". This helps to reduce a lot of unnecessary gas consumption in the contract. Every computation that you can kick to the user generating the tx, will save a lot of gas
undefined says Check what the contractKit does:
vote:
https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/sdk/contractkit/src/wrappers/Election.ts#L393
find lesser and greater:
https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/sdk/contractkit/src/wrappers/Election.ts#L420

The idea is to make the contracts (at least the core ones) the more efficient possible. All the other calculations should be handled by sdks or tools
undefined says And what other question do you have about the vote function? (I didn't get that, :P)
undefined says can anyone help me to resolve this I am getting this error during deployment on alfajores testnet
undefined says Highlighting to @Ponti | cLabs
undefined says Can you give us a little more info? It seems that you are using the default migration contract from truffle, but did you change anything?
undefined says Issue is resolved!! Thank you sir for your response
undefined says Thanks for the confirmation.

undefined says this github issue should help https://github.com/celo-org/use-contractkit/issues/45
undefined says Can anyone tell me how can i sign a transaction using use-contract when i am calling i calling a function on smart contract from my frontend i an getting this error
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says Code that i am using
undefined says 
undefined says Highlighting to @yaz
undefined says The `use-contractkit` is out of my element tbh, but that's a common error if the kit does not have the way to sign the tx for that address, and just forwards the tx to the node, and that node also does not have a way to sign it.
Try to check if the kit has that address set.
`kit.connection.isLocalAccount(address)`
undefined says I think that the `useContractKit()` already returns a kit. MAYBE (which again, I don't know) you are having different instances of the kit (which of course if it is the case, is an error from the lib). But try to check if your kit has a way to sign txs that are from that address
undefined says So is there any other way to sign a transaction to interact with smart contract on celo?
undefined says Using celo chrome extension
undefined says Perhaps try asking at #🧩celo-extension-wallet
undefined says This returning false
undefined says @Jatin Gupta Ok, it seems to be what I told you.
Instead of `{ connect, address, getConnectedKit }`
try with
`{ connect, address, kit }`
and check the same `isLocalAccount` but from that kit
undefined says Again, tbh I don't know what is that `address` that is returning. So if after testing the last thing I told you, you keep with the same issue, maybe you should ask in the #🏠general-core channel about the `use-contractkit` and what is that address and how it was obtained

undefined says Hi guys...

I want to find out if anyone would be interested in joining a Dapp project for a new social media platform. 


The social media platform is aimed at removing the censorship existing in present day social media outfits and  forestall the indirect user data thefts or if you may, user data exploitation by the above mentioned that translates into billions of dollars in few privileged pockets.


Restore true privacy and data control back to the owners of the data (the users) through decentralisation. And allow Users to benefit from their own data first hand without a 3rd party. Overall create a society where genuine positive social reputation score is incentivized for public good.


If that sounds like anything interesting or intriguing to you. If you are curious how that can be the new normal in the social media space. Then join the team that will make it happen. The team has room for a cross section development experience. No matter your level of expertise...We can use your input on the team. What is really important is your commitment to the goals of the project.


If you are interested, reply to this msg.

Do state your area of development experience and your motivation.


More information about the project would be communicated to the team when formed.


Ciao.
undefined says hi @zviad | WOTrust, i see on npm that `celo-devchain` is deprecated. https://github.com/terminal-fi/celo-devchain. is this true, should i not reference it in new docs?
undefined says the package just moved to @terminal-fi/celo-devchain
undefined says I moved everything to a clean namespace so it isn't associated with just my name
undefined says should the README install instructions be updated? to `npm i --save-dev @terminal-fi/celo-devchain`?
undefined says i just updated it 👍
undefined says Hey! Quick question, where is the query for saving users in the DB??
undefined says Or how can I interact with the blockchain using Web3 with node
undefined says /// @dev hi Celo developer community, I have a super basic question: the Celo whitepaper says "a user will issue an attestation request by sending the request to the Attestations smart contract." If the user is interacting with a smart contract directly, why do we need a validator to attest a transaction after all?
undefined says this page of the docs should help https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit
undefined says the user is initiating the request to the smart contract, but much of the verification process happens off-chain. 3 randomly selected validators will send signed SMSs to the requester, which the requester will have to submit to the contract. the contract will verify that the messages were signed by the appropriate validators. this helps ensure that no single party can control the process. you can read more here https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity
undefined says Thx
undefined says I am getting a celocli error running `celocli exchange:celo --from 0x... --value 10000000`. The error is specific to one wallet which has reached some limit it seems, can I ask for an allowance increase for this wallet?
undefined says > *"Sending Transaction: increaseAllowance... failed: Error: execution reverted: SafeMath: addition overflow
>     Error: Error: execution reverted: SafeMath: addition overflow".*
undefined says There is no more error with this particular wallet. I am trying to understand what happened, is there a cap for increase allowance by time period?
undefined says this particular error happens when you are trying to increase a number beyond a safe threshold. it has to do with how numbers work in Solidity and the EVM. you can read more about it here https://medium.com/3-min-blockchain/understanding-uint-overflows-and-underflows-solidity-ethereum-8603339259e6
undefined says I see then the only thing I was trying to do is exchanging Celo into cUSD, is it an issue with the StableToken contract?
undefined says Hi,
I try to do the the demo.
I tried to integrate the Celo SDK Java. But I couldn't initialize the connection to default alfajores

undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says Reposting in here.

Do I need an API Key to make calls to the Mainnet / Alfajaro network? I'm coming from a ERC20 where I would have an API key to make calls to mainnet.infura.com? Does that translate?
undefined says Hi Blue, it looks like those are fields that don't exist in the Celo block header. I don't really have experience with hardhat so not sure how it works, but it looks like it's expecting ethereum fields in the header. I have no idea how to fix that / or even if it can be easily fixed.
undefined says this is not an issue with the stable token contract, but the fact that you are calling the `approve` function with too large of a number. You may have already approved the token for the maximum amount, so calling the function again will fail.
undefined says are you using this java sdk? https://github.com/blaize-tech/celo-sdk-java

this SDK hasn't been updated in 10 months so it's probably broken now. has anyone else been building with a fork or a different celo java sdk?
undefined says what do you mean by ensuring the public/private key is correct? the same private key will always be associated with the same public key and account when using any of these wallets https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/wallets

creating a public/private keypair does not cost anything, but sending any transaction on the network will
undefined says you don't need an api key to access the network using forno, https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno
undefined says Hi guys! How can I check, whether my fullnode is working properly and part of the celo network?
undefined says The stats page shows 74/148 active nodes https://stats.celo.org/
undefined says So if it's not in the list, my node is not being used? What can I do about it? It's already fully synced
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs might be able to assist you on answer your node questions
undefined says @mightyplow The stats.celo.org it's having track of the validators, not every full node in the network.
If your node is synced, it means that is already part of the network. For example you can check the amount of peers that you are connected. Another thing that you can do, is to check the amount of txs that you have in your tx_pool.
The dapps using our lightest client (for example valora can switch it to use it, instead of forno) will require and use peered fullnodes. Right now, the fullnodes incentives are not set, we are still investigating the best solution for that, but it will take some time to have that defined.
undefined says Thank you very much!
undefined says Hello fellas!
Can someone please share public websocket for celo?

one more question...
eth/bnb/matic/ftm... each of these use wrapped version during swapping on exchange. what does celo use? there is no wcelo so im confused
undefined says As part of the protocol, can be transferred natively like ETH or by using the contract at this address  https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438/transactions
undefined says Can we please enable the TXPool API namespace for Forno over HTTP and WSS?
https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-txpool

I'm able to enable this API namespace on my own private full node and query for pending transactions but unable to get the same data from forno.

It doesn't seem like any security risk to opening up the txpool namespace on Forno.

Thanks
undefined says Hi team! I am attempting to sweep an entire cUSD balance from one address to another on Alfajores. I am estimating the gas price using gasPriceMinimum contract along with the Celo Dollar token address. Further, I subtract the estimated gas price from account balance to determine the amount to send. Although I cannot get past the same error  “Transaction has been reverted by the EVM”

Example txHash 0x06e6d42c95358905e28fd8ec13ebe96cdee8835affa25b5b65b4ded511c5c160  

Any tips? My gut tells me it has to do with the gas price estimation although per blockscout, I’m only using a fraction of the gas I provided.
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says the gas price looks good, is this just a simple transfer? can you share the code for how you are setting up the tx?
undefined says @joshc Yes, it is just a balance transfer from one address to the other

const transaction = await stableTokenWrapper
  .transfer(destinationAddress, amountToSendInWei.toFixed())
  .send({ from: originAddress, gasPrice: gasPriceInWei.toFixed() });
undefined says Additionally, gas + amountToSend is equal to the balance of the originAddress. If I only send .9% of the balance with the same gas, the transaction is successful.
undefined says calculating the exact amount of gas used in a transaction can be difficult, so the estimated gas limit may be slightly off. try to send all but $0.01 from the account
undefined says Thank you
undefined says it worked?
undefined says After subtracting (0.01 (in Wei) + the estimated gas price) it worked! Although, this is not ideal for small transfers - I wish there was a way to subtract the min gas cost from the amount being transferred
undefined says agree, this would be nicer. here is a good explanation on why its hard to know the exact gas limit ahead of time. *Because of the Turing completeness of the EVM, it is easy to write functions that will take different code paths with wildly different gas costs. For example, a function could choose to take different code paths according to the value of some global state variable. The real code path taken in the function is not known until transaction execution time. Therefore the gas estimate can only give an approximation of the actual cost of a transaction.*
undefined says That is a great explanation, thank you Josh! What about deducting the fees from the amount sent inflight. With Celo's low gas fee/gas price variation, estimating the gas for simple transfers seems like an avoidable step?
undefined says usually SDKs will estimate this for you, so you dont need to do it explicitly

the full error is: `non-whitelisted fee currency address (supplied gas 10010499)`
undefined says Solved?
undefined says Not yet :T
undefined says there is an old github issue related to this i believe, you can find details here https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/5956

part of the problem is probably that there are plans to deprecate dappkit and it is recommended to use wallet connect instead. https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/8259
undefined says this doc shows how to use wallet connect with valora https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/walkthroughs/valora-wc-v1
undefined says Thanks! Will try this out 🙂
undefined says It should work. Let me know
undefined says Hey are decentralised protocols like Ceramic, IDX and 3ID compatible with Celo ?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says Thanks @Lynne  !
undefined says https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/blockchain/ it says it supports Ethereum, Cosmos, Near, Tezos. Was wondering if it would work on Celo as it is EVM compatible
undefined says I'm trying to follow WalletConnect v1 but im getting the error `document is not defined in Window` on React Native Expo, so I tried WalletConnect v2, but I'm not sure how to connect to Alfajores wallet
undefined says Hi guys!
Has anyone faced this error:
“missing required field ‘sha3Uncles’ for Header”
Trying to mint NFT on Alfajores Testnet via go-ethereum library
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says based on my limited understanding of ceramic, it should work with celo since the address format is the same. lmk if you try it and what results you see
undefined says if you are using wallet connect v1, you should use the react native specific provider, https://docs.walletconnect.com/1.0/quick-start/dapps/react-native

is this the one that you are trying to use?
undefined says can you share some more info about your process? Are you trying to this with a script via the command line? celo uses a modified version of go-ethereum, https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain
undefined says Oh oops! Yup! It’s this one, I got  confused with the versions 😅 How do you connect to Alfajores since only Valora is the one in the registry?
undefined says Sure
undefined says will check this library, thx, and will ask related questions after
undefined says you can get the alfajores mobile app from here https://celo.org/developers/wallet
undefined says I currently have Alfajores installed, and trying to follow the WalletConnect v1 React Native provider tutorial, but it seems like it's not deep linking to the wallet when I click Valora, or clicking Celo Wallet returns an error `Unable to open url.` Sorry for being a noob at this 😓

Edit: Apparently on Android it auto detects my Alfajores wallet, but on iOS it shows all of the wallets with their respective links (but some are not working)

Edit 2: On iOS, weird that deeplinking to Valora works now, but I don't know how to deeplink to Alfajores?
undefined says Hi, what are the concurrent connection and api call rate limits on Forno HTTP and Forno WSS?
Would like to know the rate limits so that I can set my concurrency appropriately. Thanks.
undefined says hmm, im not sure. i use android and the deep link pops up my entire list of wallets and i can pick which wallet I want to use. the list includes my ETH wallets, Valora and the alfajores apps. @jeanregisser or @Lisa | Valora may be able to help with the deep linking to alfajores on iOS question
undefined says @trevor | cLabs do you know this?
undefined says Hello
undefined says I made my own nft in Alfajores in ordrer to try, Is there any way to make mint random if I publish my nft ?
undefined says + why does it randomly do this  ?
undefined says All I am looking for some help around some lost funds.  Is there someone that can help track down a transaction and confirm if there is an issue?  The developer is asking for proof but I do not have a ton of knowledge reading TX in CELO explorer.  Any help is appreciated
undefined says Afaik there are no IP-specific rate limits but it's been a while since I personally touched forno
undefined says Howdy! I'd like to invite you to our Discord (https://discord.com/invite/J5XMtMkwC4) to post this question in the #dapp-dev channel. Once there, I will get one of our Valora engineers over to help.  Thank you!
undefined says the forno limits are 20.000 requests/minute and 500.000 requests/hour from the same ip

undefined says can anyone tell me how to increase default tx pool size of celo?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says You can check the configuration flags which has a few options:
```
TRANSACTION POOL OPTIONS:
  --txpool.locals value               Comma separated accounts to treat as locals (no flush, priority inclusion)
  --txpool.nolocals                   Disables price exemptions for locally submitted transactions
  --txpool.journal value              Disk journal for local transaction to survive node restarts (default: "transactions.rlp")
  --txpool.rejournal value            Time interval to regenerate the local transaction journal (default: 1h0m0s)
  --txpool.pricelimit value           Minimum gas price limit to enforce for acceptance into the pool (default: 1)
  --txpool.pricebump value            Price bump percentage to replace an already existing transaction (default: 10)
  --txpool.accountslots value         Minimum number of executable transaction slots guaranteed per account (default: 16)
  --txpool.globalslots value          Maximum number of executable transaction slots for all accounts (default: 4096)
  --txpool.accountqueue value         Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots permitted per account (default: 64)
  --txpool.globalqueue value          Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots for all accounts (default: 1024)
  --txpool.lifetime value             Maximum amount of time non-executable transaction are queued (default: 3h0m0s)
```
I don't know your exact case, but probably the `--txpool.globalslots` should work

undefined says it's a `geth` flag. Basically a flag when you start the node. How are you running it?
undefined says they are working on it! hopefully live soon 🤞
undefined says how robust do you need it to be? You could set up a contract that you post API data to that only accepts transactions from your account, so you have guarantees about the source of the data

undefined says How would u go about posting the data?
undefined says Ive been struggling tk figure out how to make restful calls in a smart contract
undefined says I guess the one thought is that the api comes in to some off chain web3.js program, which calls a contract that takes in the relevant data from the web3.js program as an argument?
undefined says you could have a storage variable in the smart contract that stores the data and have a function that allows you to update that storage variable with the latest data. this article will be helpful https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/oracle.html

undefined says I'm subscribed to Forno over wss to new block events, and whenever a block is confirmed, if I compare the local timestamp to the block's canonical timestamp, I'm always between 700ms to 850ms behind the block's canonical timestamp.

This is as measured by a client in a datacenter in Equinix Sunnyvale, CA datacenter. Should I move to a different data center to receive the new blocks faster?

I presume that I should move the infra to somewhere close to where the bulk of the validators are?

undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs or @yaz might be able to help
undefined says are you trying to generate a new testnet
undefined says No i have a devnet with a single validator and I am trying to check the load that celo blockchain bear
undefined says cc @Ponti | cLabs @Mariano | cLabs do you know what those config values are for
undefined says @0xrachit A few things there
1) In master we have some work that will be part of the Expresso hard fork (for example, those `RPCGasCap` and `RPCTxFeeCap` that you are seeing). I strongly recommend you to use one of the released versions (for example the branch `release/1.4.x` that you will find both versions
2) for testnets I also recommend you to use mycelo command. You can generate dev nets with 1 or multiple validators, with all our core contracts deployed (which will be a little more closed to the productive chains)
undefined says And just as info, the RPCGasCap is used as the gas cap for gas_estimations, for example. You can set it with zero which will be like disabling the cap
And the RPCTxFeeCap, it's something similar. A Cap in the transaction fee that can be sent via an rpc call (also, 0 = no cap)
undefined says ```Error: tx fee (0.00 ether) exceeds the configured cap (500000000000000006643777536.00 celo)
```
I was getting this error in my devnet and also i have increased the RPCTxFeeCap to a large number.

Is this error due to RPCTxFeeCap ? I would be great if you can tell me this.
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs also is this cap for single transaction or it is something else
undefined says @0xrachit I'm checking why it's happening, but yes, it seems related. Try to set that `RPCTxFeeCap` to zero to basically avoid that check (except that you are using that for something), at least until I found what is going on
undefined says @0xrachit also, this `(500000000000000006643777536.00 celo)` failing message number, is shown when you have the `RPCTxFeeCap` as `500`?
undefined says Also, can you check if you are having a warning log in the client something similar to this:
` Error in retrieving exchange rate.  Will do comparison of two values without exchange rate conversion.`
undefined says @Kirill Madorin had a good question about syncing a node on alfajores. do we have alfajores state for download anywhere so they don't have to wait for the node to sync?
undefined says thanks @Ponti | cLabs i think that error was due RPCTxFeeCap and it is resolved now
undefined says Hey! Would POAP https://github.com/poap-xyz/poap-contracts work on Celo ?
undefined says Hey 👋 We've done approx 80% of the work to bring poaps to Celo natively (i.e. minting on Celo). Unfortunately, the poap team has been delayed with their final part of the integration because they needed to reallocate resources to keeping the general service up (as demand has spiked recently).

Is there a particular reason you are interested in POAPs? (just out of curiosity) 🙂
undefined says Hello is there someone from Clabs on.  We are having a few issues on our NFT Marketplace and wanted to share the smart contract with you to see if you can help
undefined says Highlighted at @0xArthur.xyz | cLabs @joshc
undefined says I wanted to try out a poap @Into The Verse XD
undefined says @0xArthur.xyz | cLabs or @joshc can one of you take a look at our smart contract
undefined says Ah got it 😄 You can create the POAP today but you are not yet able to mint them on Celo. As and when that's completed you should hear about it in the general channel. Feel free to ping me if you haven't heard in a while or are not sure. I can give you a status update 👍
undefined says Thanks for tagging me @biyiemmy. Unfortunately I'm not a solidity engineer 🙂
undefined says Lol. No worries. I think we have it sorted out.
undefined says Alright!
undefined says hello i need help, i have 100 cUSD how to send this token from celo blockchain to ETH mainnet as a balance, not not a token. Where i can swap it ? I need eth to pay my gas fee, because i have a DAI token
undefined says metamask need eth to send DAI
undefined says With bridging you can get WETH
undefined says so, i should swap cusd to WETH from ubeswap
undefined says and then? how ubeswap send to my eth mainnet
undefined says https://optics.app/
undefined says okay noted BRO nice ingfo!
undefined says but optics app only support polygon and celo address?
undefined says ETH bridging is also supported on optics
undefined says so i need swap my cusd to weth ?
undefined says and unwrap my weth to eth mainnet use optics
undefined says You can swap directly to ETH or WETH, whichever meets your need
undefined says okay
undefined says but i should use metamask wallet or celo?
undefined says bcz i have add other network in my metamask, such as bsc, xdai, and polygon
undefined says You can use Metamask
undefined says hi I have a question, on your starting guide you suggest to set up hardhat like this:
```
   alfajores: {
     url: "https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org",
     accounts: {
       mnemonic: process.env.MNEMONIC,
       path: "m/44'/52752'/0'/0"
     },
     chainId: 44787
   }
```

when I try to do that everything works fine except that the addresses are different from the ones I can see on metamask which might cause some inconveniences, however if I do not set the derivation path the addresses derived match the metamask ones, I have also tried to send a transaction and everything works fine. Are there any hidden issues with not setting the derivation path that I did not see? also would you suggest this approach for deploying applications?
undefined says also this seems to be a scam 😄
undefined says Banned, thank you
undefined says I get this error :

call to Test1.random errored: Internal JSON-RPC error.
{
  "code": -32000
  "message": "invalid opcode: opcode 0x44 not defined"
}

for this contract in the picture below when using the injected web3 on the celo testnet network, but it works well when using ethereum JavaScript VM, does anyone here know why that is?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says UPDATED again: 

It seems the issue comes from "block.timestamp", for some reason it this function doesn't returns the current timestamp. 

block.difficulty seems to actually seems to be the cause of the "opcode 0x44 not defined"

Is there another alternative? The issue is not on ethereum JS VM
undefined says Hello on the other side, 

Is there anyone here who's an expert in integrating and using Celo Java SDK library? 

Looking to incorporate in my teams app.
undefined says wallets in the celo ecosystem use a different derivation path than ETH. This just means that the private keys associated with a seed phrase are different. you can read more about it here https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/celo-for-eth-devs#things-to-watch-out-for
undefined says celo is proof of stake, so there is no concept of block difficulty. that opcode has been removed from Celo's version of the EVM
undefined says looks like you are just trying to get a random number. you could use the random number contract on celo https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x22a4aAF42A50bFA7238182460E32f15859c93dfe/transactions
undefined says thank you very much
undefined says Hi!
@joshc 
I am trying to use this library, I have already compiled solidity smart contracts using abigen , but I am getting this error:
> out0 := *abi.ConvertType(out[0], new([32]byte)).(*[32]byte)
undefined: "github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/accounts/abi".ConvertType
There is a abi.ConvertType in go-thereum library, but for some reasons no such method in go-celo. And I have used abigen from go-celo

Can you help me please?
undefined says i am not well versed in the celo-blockchain code, but @Ponti | cLabs may be able to point you in the right direction
undefined says Hi @Faceless . Which version of the `celo-blockchain` are you using?
We are in the middle of a big update from upstream. What we have already on master merged a PR that covers until the 1.9.25 version of geth, which adds the ConvertType to the abi package. We are also making an update util the 1.10.7 but for that, we will require to make a fork (the Expresso fork that we are going to announce soon but will be addressed by the end of January approx).
If you are using the 1.4.1, that function won't be there, but if you can (and want to) use master, you shouldn't have any problem.
undefined says ah, I see, I was using v1.4.1
Will try to update, thx!
undefined says Hey guys, are there any bridges for CELO/Polygon testnets?

undefined says This is Robert working as a full-stack Blockchain developer, I am looking for a new opportunity.
I have extensive experience with building Token, CEX, DEX, DEFI(NFT) with the following skills.
Ethereum, BSC, Tron, Cardano, Celo, Matic, Solana, Kyber......

If you have any position for me, you can dm me any time and don't hesitate to ping me.
Thank you.
undefined says no worries. how are you trying to verify it, on the website? we have a few pages in our docs that might help. verifying with hardhat sometimes doesn't work, but i have good luck with verifying with the remix sourcify plugin https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-remix#verify-the-smart-contract
undefined says How do people feel about the network getting spammed incessantly with arb calls to `0x57AbAE14E7F223aB8C4D2C9bDe135b8Ff6b884ec` and `0xf93525b95856fE1F1CCD37420bA4ef5dd060D408`?

example block: https://explorer.celo.org/block/10115323/transactions
It's very annoying for these arb calls to take up 80% of the block on average.
As far as I can tell, these arbs aren't even trying to backrun any specific order, the caller is literally just taking a "spray & pray" approach.
undefined says hey @diadata-tech can you explain a bit here?
undefined says is there a convenient way to deploy+verify contracts on Celo? One that works consistently right now is compiling with Remix, and publishing with Sourcify Plugin. But it fails for cases where one contract deploys another one.
undefined says and it is far from convenient. Any way to autoverify with hardhat?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says Thanks guys for the solution! @joshc , the docu page was what I was missing 🙂 Before, I used a tutorial from blockscout, where they described how to verify on the website (in general), but that didn't work. With sourcify I was able to verify, thank you!
undefined says yes, you can do it with hardhat, but you will need to set up the `hardhat-deploy` plugin. i just deployed a contract to alfajores and verified it with the script and it worked great https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy
undefined says what if the contract was already deployed via hardhat previously, e.g. the current situation with MoolaV2 contracts, can the plugin still generate the metadata needed?
undefined says i think so, check this section of the hardhat deploy docs https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy#migrating-existing-deployment-to-hardhat-deploy
undefined says ah nice, then we have a shot of verifying the moola v2 existing deployment
undefined says Is forno having some latency problems today? I'm seeing confirmed blocks websocket notification almost 1.5s to 2s after the block's timestamp, usually its within <1s
undefined says sweet! let me know if this works out for you
undefined says Hey team! I am looking for a way to verify the amounts exchanged in a Mento transaction. 

After using the contract kit —> kit.contracts.getExchange(StableToken.cUSD)  

I would like to verify the amounts exchanged given the respective transaction ID. I believe this is done by decoding the transaction input however, the ABI found here doesn’t work for me (there is no value variables)

Any tips?

________

I found the Mento/Exchange ABI in the contract kit node module under the generated folder! Just have to figure out how to differentiate between cUSD & cEUR given a transaction
undefined says perhaps @joshc can tell more about this
undefined says hey @EzraCelo And @joshc thanks for the earlier help. we were able to get everything sorted. we have our docu living here for the oralce: `https://github.com/diadata-org/diadata/blob/master/documentation/oracle-documentation/celo.md`. we also have an audit for the celo contract we deployed. happy to send that over as we would be keen to have some official support from the celo team in your docs if everything looks agreeable.
undefined says let me know where/ how to push the audit to you guys
undefined says you can look at the transaction logs (Events) to see the amounts https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0xce6dfd59314a8e68e5186be0afc138a76bd7ee45648b76b4dc316c757ad61952/logs you can tell if it is cUSD or cEUR based on the contract addresses. cUSD is `0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a`, cEUR is `0xD8763CBa276a3738E6DE85b4b3bF5FDed6D6cA73`
undefined says feel free to send it to me via email at josh@clabs.co
undefined says This is great thank you! On a slightly separate note, to trigger a mento transaction using the contractKit, why do we need to add an account (private key) to the kit? i.e.

const kit = ContractKit.newKit(CELO_RPC);
kit.defaultAccount = CELO_PUBLIC_ADDRESS;
kit.connection.addAccount(CELO_PRIVATE_KEY);

If we already got an approval from the corresponding public address ?

In other words, to exchange.quoteStableSell, shouldn’t the following do the job? (the tokenWrapper below is retrieved using a kit that has the private key)

const approveTx = await tokenWrapper
  .approve(exchange.address, amountWei)
  .send();

const mentoExchange = await kit.contracts.getExchange(StableToken.cUSD);
undefined says Hey sauce, you can join the developer office hour as Josh is holding it right now
undefined says Hi, how can i get data from a contract address? I would like to be able to pull transfers, holders and amount per holder.
holder = wallet
Is there any site or API example I could use
?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says its probably best to use the graph to do this. you can read more about how to use the graph with celo here https://docs.celo.org/blog/using-the-graph
undefined says you can search the already published subgraphs for celo on this page, https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/. there might be some good references there
undefined says Thanks for this!!
undefined says Is there something wrong with BlockExplorer?
My account has a incorrect number of transactions count: https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x4754a69FFC2a0300d6aa80BbC88149346c9fD90C/transactions
There should be 80k+ transactions from that wallet, but UI only shows 40
undefined says Hi guys. Do you know how to swap in mento with code?

undefined says @zviad | WOTrust @joshc any idea how to fix 'StableTokenBRL not yet registered' issue. It is coming from contractkit and also from swappa after reinstalling all packages
undefined says I posted same thing in #🏠general-core . looks like ContractKit is broken in 1.4.x. 

So just set your @wu/xxx package dependencies to "~1.3.0" to make sure you dont upgrade to 1.4.x
undefined says Thank you. That is what I've done right now. In swappa I've had to change "^1.2.4" to "~1.3.0"
undefined says 1.4.1 is out and includes a fix for this, we're going to deprecate 1.4.0 but not unpublish it cc @zviad | WOTrust
undefined says thx you for this update @joshc
undefined says I've been experiencing extreme slowness with Forno endpoint since yesterday, is there any other free node I can use ? I have switched temporarily to DataHub but it is expensive.
undefined says Alternatively if you know what the issue with Forno is and when it will be fixed
undefined says Afaik there were no issues with the network, but there were a few issues with the load balancers for forno in asia and europe, yesterday and today.
undefined says hi guys, does the validators always produce a new block every 5s? sometimes it runs behind, or early.
When it runs behind, I can think of latency being the reason.
When it runs ahead of schedule, what is the reason?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says Do you have any block # examples to check?
undefined says are there still issues today? do we expect the situation to stabilize with Forno?
undefined says It looks stable now
undefined says yes thanks. Can I expect faster transactions on the chain running my node on a personal computer?
undefined says For a tx to get in the chain, it needs to be included by a proposer validator. What you can guarantee with your own node is that there's no single point of failure between your tx and the validators, since you are using your own p2p connections instead of directly talking to forno.

So, in short, it's better, but not that much
undefined says If you are only sparsely sending txs to the network, I'd continue using forno or any other public node
undefined says my daily usage with datahub is close to 1M requests on s busy day (not sure how the number is calculated) so maybe I would gain using my node. Do i need a full node or would a light one provide the same results?
undefined says Yes, that amount of requests definitely justifies running your own node.

Light nodes do not have a local copy of the state, so if you need to actually execute a tx locally (e.g estimate gas) it will be too slow, since it needs to request state on demand
undefined says Thanks that’s really helpful, I’m excited about setting up my full node over the weekend !
undefined says when running my own node what should be the parameters for `celocli config:set` ? I suppose this is `celocli config:set --node=http://127.0.0.1:8545
`, that's what I've used. How long does it take to get the node synced ?
undefined says http://127.0.0.1:8545, I think is the default yes, but you can set it, just in case you have set something before. Just check if you didn't change the port. And for synced, depends if you started a full sync or a fast sync, but it will take some days
undefined says @kewl And to add more info in what @pastoh said, you are not only sending txs to the node, you are also retrieving info from it. For example, every time you execute a celocli command, there are a lot of thing being consumed from the node, addresses, the nonce of your address, gas estimation, etc etc. It's not only a matter of getting your tx added. Forno it's a public node, and should be think as a helper for testing things, and for "human usage" (we don't expect for a common user to run a node to pay for something using metamask). If someone builds a dapp, or runs a script, should think of running their own node to control their request rate. Otherwise, as Forno is still a public node, we will eventually ban some ips that make a heavy usage, just to maintain the health of Forno for the other users.
undefined says I have started a full sync, after 3 days I saw it synced and it seems it lost it and I am 50k blocks behind now. I have a fast connection but I see the up/down speeds at around 150 KiB only I wonder why it cannot download the information faster.
undefined says Syncing relies on nodes in the network sharing transaction and state data, and then your node executing the transactions and confirming the state data. Downloading is bottlenecked by how fast your peer is willing to serve the data to your node. Execution is mostly bottlenecked by disk performance and is more often the bottleneck in syncing. As a note, if you node is not running on an SSD (i.e. it is running on an HDD) it will likely have a hard time keeping up with the chain.
undefined says @victorgraf My node has synced and the connection is solid, I am executing transactions through my node, everything is significantly faster than with **Forno** or **DataHub**, this is really great! Thanks for your help in the process. Regarding the disk access I have moved it from SSD to HDD because it takes 46G and my SSD was full. However I am monitoring the i/o on the HDD and see nothing more than 100-200k/sec, nothing the HDD cannot handle. Do you really think the HDD is the bottleneck?
undefined says Anyway things seem to be working as they should, if I could fast things up a bit with a SSD I will buy a new one but I am not convinced this is slowing it down.
undefined says If I want to access my node (at let say IP 164.132.34.102) remotely from another machine should I just open the port *8545* and indicate http://164.132.34.102:8545/ ? I need to look at Docker Networking probably, would you recommend I open my full node to outside?
undefined says @kewl Well, you can make it public, which could eventually mean that someone else can use it, so beware of that. You can limit which things could be used from the rpc calls using the flag `--rpcapi=<...>` to limit which things could be access from outside.
For example, forno just shows these services `--rpcapi=eth,net,rpc,web3`. If you allow everyone to use, for example, `personal`, in the window of time where you are unlocking your account, another user could use it. Or if you let them access to your `admin` module could be a problem.
You can administrate all the other modules attaching yourself to the `.ipc` file, that you will be the only one that will have access to.
So, yes, you can make it public, but be completely aware of the modules you are listing for the outside, and avoid to store keys on it. Also you should probably check if the rate limit you are experiencing is only from your flow, or someone else is using it (a bot or whatever), in that case, if the performance of your node is being affected, you could think of a more robust solution using a VPN or something else.
undefined says Another option you may explore is restrict incoming traffic to your node using a firewall or security groups. Personally I'd recommend avoid exposing your node publicly if you can. If you need to expose, as ponti said is important not to expose any dangerous api (like `personal`, `admin` or `debug`) because there will be bots looking to ethereum compatible rpc apis. Also it could be valuable using a different port to `8545`. But a general advise, if it can be  exposed just locally, or if you can control network traffic with firewalls or security groups, that brings an extra layer of security (anyway avoid exposing those apis too)
undefined says As long as your node is keeping in sync and serving your requests, there is no need to use SSD over HDD. The main reason you'd want to use SSD is that the read/write latency is much lower. Read latency is important because executing transactions may require arbitrary data from the chain state, which is store on disk (and cached in memory). Throughput is less likely to be the bottleneck.
undefined says Hello, CELO developers

Have some issues with transfers. I'm trying to transfer all funds from this account
https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x5bE862Ce64b3Ff8D3928E5D15C73b9a5064d0FF3/transactions

But get an error: Returned error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value + gatewayFee

Here is tx:
{
       "nonce": "0",
       "gasPrice": "0x0147d35700",
       "gas": "0x04e200",
       "to": "0xeec02a6d1a7f9f534b9609c8ee30b9cf9a7fe1b3",
       "value": "0x01b2c3d1e60375400000",
       "input": "0x",
       "feeCurrency": "0x",
       "gatewayFeeRecipient": "0x",
       "gatewayFee": "0x",
}

Does anyone can help with this?
undefined says Please leave a small amount for gas fee and try again.
undefined says Do I need to decrease a gas price?
undefined says The gas price is automatically set. You don't need to decrease. Make sure you are leaving behind small amount to cover that fee.
undefined says I subtract gasPrice * gas from total balance of CELO on this address

So gas * gasPrice + value = total CELO balance

Can it be a source of issue?
undefined says Ok, looks like I have wrong calculation. Thanks for help. Will recheck it
undefined says Looks like a bug:

Passed value: 0x1b2c3d1e603753b8000
But got:

```
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says your account doesn't have enough CELO to send the amount you are trying to send. `0x01b2c3d1e60375400000` is about 8k CELO and there is less than 1 CELO in that account
undefined says Yes, I made transfer few minutes ago
undefined says hey there, i'm trying to fullsync mainnet, and it seems to have drastically slowed down syncing with a ton of "Ethereum peer connected" messages in the log. Restarting the node did not help. Any idea ?
undefined says also what is the correct stats server address for mainnet ? `stats-server.celo.org` seems to strangely behave here displaying block number 0 with logs warn `Stats login failed err="delegation sign timeout""`
undefined says It's possible you are having trouble find and keeping connections with peers. One thing that might help is to ensure that nodes can make inbound connection attempts to your node. In general, I think most nodes on the network are at their peer limit.
undefined says `stats-server.celo.org` is the correct backend for mainnet. `delegation sign timeout` is related to how proxies get signatures from validators to submit messages to the stats server. Are you running your fullnode as a proxy? If not we'll need to look into why its trying to use delegate sign.
undefined says hi @victorgraf , thanks for your answers. I'm running two full setups, one for baklava and one for mainnet (proxy, validator, attestation). Both are deployed with the same ansible procedure, except the relevant address variables etc. However the mainnet proxy node has this "ethereum peer connected" log overflow and syncs slowly. How can I check if nodes can make inbound connection ?
undefined says that was on the proxy yes
undefined says also currently it seems the mainnet validator cannot connect to its proxy for some reason
```
Looking for peers                        peercount=0 tried=1 static=1```
undefined says i'm a little worried that we will miss the foundation's voting if i don't manage to get mainnet synced fast enough, can you explain how it happens in that case ?
undefined says in Geth, if I have a remote node's IP address and port, how would I find it's enode public key?
undefined says Not sure of a way off the top of my head. You generally need the public key to connect to the node on the p2p network.
undefined says I'm not sure what the Foundation would want to do, but it definitly is something you should ask them about. Likely they will simply delay voting.
undefined says Could you run with `--vmodule='p2p/*=5'` to get a more descriptive log and share it?
undefined says A quick way to test if external nodes can reach it is to use `nc` to open a connection on the p2p port from a public network. That'll at least tell you if its reachable.
undefined says (It should be possible for the public to reach the proxy, but not the validator, and for the validator and the proxy to reach each other)
undefined says How would i get the public key of the validator proxy nodes? is that published somewhere onchain?
undefined says I have the validator proxy node's raw IP & port, missing their pubkeys:
https://github.com/diwu1989/celo-fullnode/blob/master/raw_validators.json
undefined says Would like to add all validators as static nodes for 1-hop order routing
undefined says Specifically, the `$PROXY_ENODE` that is set during validator setup
undefined says Ah, well if its a proxy you control you can use `admin.nodeInfo` in the JavaScript console to get the nodes full information, including its enode.
undefined says If not, but you have a node that is participating in the p2p network (e.g. you run a full node) you can look for the ip and port in the list of peers (e.g. through `admin.peers`) There is also a more complete peer discovery table the node maintains, but I don't know of any way to access it without modifying the client code.
undefined says Ah i see, okay i'll have to brute force this via my full node...
Would be nice to just have all of the validator proxies published officially somewhere
undefined says the 3 main errors i see are:
```

Couldn't add port mapping                proto=udp extport=30303 intport=30303 interface="UPnP or NAT-PMP" err="no UPnP or NAT-PMP router discovered"
Removing p2p peer                        peercount=1  id=5c9aa36facf5242f duration=39.242ms  req=true err="too many peers"
Removing p2p peer                        peercount=10 id=b8901e19095cd2b4 duration=35.491ms  req=true err="too many inbound peers"```
undefined says We actually prefer not to have that be something easy to get to make DoS attacks harder to execute
undefined says the peers do grow though, through monitoring i can read up to 100+ peers
undefined says ```
Couldn't add port mapping                proto=udp extport=30303 intport=30303 interface="UPnP or NAT-PMP" err="no UPnP or NAT-PMP router discovered"
```
So this is not actually an error you need to worry about. This is a a feature to punch a hole in home firewalls and allow inbound connections to the node. If you are not on a home network, or on a home network with UPnP disabled, this is expected.
undefined says ```
Removing p2p peer                        peercount=1  id=5c9aa36facf5242f duration=39.242ms  req=true err="too many peers"
Removing p2p peer                        peercount=10 id=b8901e19095cd2b4 duration=35.491ms  req=true err="too many inbound peers"
```
The `req=true` indicates that the remote peer requested the disconnect (i.e. the remote peer is dropping the connection). In this case both are as a result of the remote peer being at their peering limit.
undefined says so i think what I can provide is:
- build a set of full nodes that directly connect 1-hop to ALL of the validator proxy nodes
- offer a low-cost RPC subscription service for people who want the fastest order routing to my set of full nodes
undefined says another thing im doing is I have connected to all forno nodes, so any pending TX going into default forno mem-pool, I should also be able to see very quickly on my nodes
undefined says that's another benefit I can offer from my service
undefined says reliable and fast peeks into pending TX & fastest order publishing into the validators
undefined says I've seen many situations where my own bots see the official Oracle Report pending TX, and I publish a TX that's at the same gas price, and mine somehow get mined by the validator BEFORE the official oracle report. (which should not happen if Forno is publishing pending TX into validator faster than my own infra)
undefined says @victorgraf would the full log be helpful ?
undefined says @peac | ZKValidator (ango) u need to set up your full node with a publicly routeable Ipv4 address
undefined says trying to run this behind a NAT is not gonna be a fun experience
undefined says just get a server in a data center instead of running this at home
undefined says it is on a server with a public ip
undefined says R u using docker?
undefined says yes
undefined says okay u didn't forward ports correctly then
undefined says ```yml
    ports:
      - 30303:30303
      - 30303:30303/udp
      # TODO allow only validator IP
      - 30503:30503
      - "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].zerotier_ip }}:6060:6060"
```
undefined says 2-things:
- is your server actually directly attached to your public IPv4 or is this something like the GCP internal IP thing?
- what is your docker port mapping
undefined says the server is directly attached to the public ipv4/6
undefined says A full log may be helpful. I can take a look. To be clear, the issue you are working to solve now is to get the validators and proxy connected, or was that resolved?
undefined says Feel free to DM it to me
undefined says i'm getting the log from the validator with the same level of debug to check
undefined says the mainnet proxy syncs superslow and has an unusually high level of "peer connected" log which does not seem healthy to me, which is the issue i'm working on right now
undefined says i have a ton of `peer connected` log messages too, they're harmless
undefined says u can set up a trusted list of static peers and then just do `no-discover`
undefined says Are we currently running with `EIP-3529: refunds are capped to gasUsed / 5` on or off?
The Espresso hardfork, is it live?
undefined says Espresso hardfork is live on Baklava, but not on Mainnet
undefined says Great, guess my Chi gastokens are still useful for a bit longer, thanks
undefined says hello. is there more detail guide how to maintain fullnode ? how to check that node maintain tx? reward address for the future fees?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says @joshc hello. is there more detail guide how to maintain fullnode ? how to check that node maintain tx? reward address for the future fees?  real ip requirements, slashing? etc...
undefined says did u mean fullnode or validator node?
full nodes do not earn any rewards at the moment, the etherbase you set might eventually earn some full node fees.
As for real-ip requirement, that's ideal, but not required.
Slashing does not apply to fullnode, only to validator
undefined says if you want to take a look at a simple set of startup scripts for full node, see https://github.com/diwu1989/celo-fullnode
undefined says ok , than a bit newbie question... how can i get access to this wallet? i tried restore it to standart wallet - but it doesnt have seed phrase... only keyfile..
undefined says I was mean fullnode. i know that nodes don't earn at the moment... just have some free resources )
undefined says keyfile is all u need, just go into Metamask, import external account with the keyfile content as the private key
undefined says If you have free infra to run full nodes, then consider publishing its HTTP RPC and Websocket RPC urls on github somewhere so that the community can utilize as a backup to Forno. More internet accessible WS RPC hosts is always useful.
undefined says thanks, it did help
undefined says did you get your question answered? let me know if you need more help

undefined says the number of validators is known, the number of full nodes, you need to inspect the distributed peer table to get an estimate.
Some full nodes are also run with only trusted + static peers and discovery turned off, so idk if they even get published into the peer table.
undefined says I run all of my full nodes with discovery turned off and only with static nodes

undefined says does the node stop syncing after this error? transactions that are reverted by the EVM may still be valid transactions at the protocol layer, it just means that the smart contract code that was executed was not successful. the reverted transaction is still included in the block
undefined says This is normal, I get this all the time, it's cus of bad client
undefined says You need to disable "admin" and "debug" for safety
undefined says tks,The node is still in synchronization and does not affect

undefined says Hello, is there a tutorial/article on how to setup VSCode + Hard Hat + Celo environment? Mainly how do I integrate Celo + nets with Hard Hat? So I can start developing on Celo 🙂 Thank you
undefined says You can start from below

https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-hardhat
undefined says Oh that’s perfect! How did I missed that. Thanks 🤞
undefined says Not sure is the right place, but I have a question about ODIS and how to look up if a phone provided by a user is associated with a wallet, I find the documentation unclear. Thanks.
undefined says highlighting to @joshc
undefined says here is an example script here that does a lookup https://gist.github.com/critesjosh/f22cd6366d1da2a06d9447ca0c82eee5
undefined says does this answer your question?
undefined says Many thanks!
undefined says Does CELO have a public RPC interface？
undefined says Yes it does
undefined says Can a mento transaction be done between two different addresses? e.g. convert CELO from 0Xabc to cUSD at 0Xdef
undefined says You should post at #⇄mento-fi
undefined says hello I recently added celo network to metamask and then bought celo from sushi swap but when i purchased i was on eth mainet is there a way to recover asset (edited)
[10:49 PM]
undefined says There is an ODIS sample in Python?
undefined says not that i am aware of
undefined says you bought CELO on eth mainnet?
undefined says yes through Sushi swap, i thought i was on Celo mainnet but the transaction hash is for etherscan
undefined says If you bought on ETH, you should be able to bridge it to Celo using our Optics bridge

https://optics.app/
undefined says so it says error fetching transaction, can i send you the trasaction hash
undefined says Yes, sure
undefined says im going to remove hash now
undefined says Can you send the hash to my pm? Looks like I missed it
undefined says I can see the transaction on ETH, you have 85 CELO on ETH
undefined says Anyone having trouble deploying to Baklava? I'm getting `-- rlp: value size exceeds available input length.`

undefined says Hey team! Any reason why the transaction fee in the Celo Block Explorer would be 0 for a $Celo (non contract or proxy) transfer ?

Additionally, I noticed when using the contract kit the gasUsed is supplied but the price of gas is 0. (Using forno)
undefined says Trying to use the celo version of `devp2p` tool to crawl the peer network, and it's not working:

On Celo, how do you crawl all of the peers?
undefined says Hi, can somebody please help me. 

I have a pending transaction for almost 2 hours now due to low gas fees I think. Is there a way to overwrite or cancel the pending transaction by editing nonce using the given wallets we have right now.
undefined says Transaction ID: https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0x0e9db49a0c89fb445f9d22bb81f9ba038a88505d1cf8c7be7e407f2e77895f33/internal-transactions

undefined says Anyone has experience with the withdraw function from an escrow contract using an unverified phone number? I can't find how is done.
undefined says yea, you can set a custom tx nonce with metamask or  the celo extension wallet https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celoextensionwallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh
undefined says Hi, I tried it (it failed) but the transaction is a createaccount transaction for locking in preparation for staking and I think there's no way for me to replicate that kind of transaction in metamask.
undefined says Does celowallet extension have the option to stake and edit nonce?
undefined says Also, I think it's not a gas issue since the max gas amount for the transaction is at 0.01 Celo (which I think is enough).
undefined says the problem is the gasPrice, not the max gas. there is also a gas limit of 20m for the tx for some reason, which is way high. max gas is gas limit * gas price. you need to make the gas price higher. 

you can enable a setting in metamask to edit the hex data, which you could include to call the `createAccount` method on the contract and pass the hex data that is included in your original tx. 

I don't think the celo extension wallet has an option to stake, but it has an option to edit the nonce. 

this is a nice app that has staking funcitonality https://churrofi.app/
undefined says `gas limit of 20m` this is the block limit, never set your gas limit higher than 19m or else it risk being stuck in mem pool forever.
as for gas price, even a low gas price of `0.1 gwei` will work
undefined says when I batch mint ChiTokens, I only mint up to 15m gas at a time for safety, anything higher is likely to get stuck for a few blocks.
undefined says his TX got stuck cus he set a stupid gas limit, and validators are choosing not to include his tx despite an appropriate gas price because that one TX would end up filling the entire block,,, should set gas limit to the correct limit
undefined says Thanks guys, issue resolved.

Editing nonce to nonce 0 worked. @Arrow walked me through the process. Thanks guys
undefined says I got some DM responses, but no one kmows if and how it could work. Could it be that non verified numbers can't really get a payment without a trick of holding the funds in an intermediary account? Original question:
Anyone has experience with the withdraw function from an escrow contract using an unverified phone number? I can't find how is done.
undefined says is there any video available to deploy nft on celo mainnet?
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/walkthroughs/no-code-erc721
undefined says is there any blog about mint also like we did mint on solana network?
undefined says Blog about minting what?
undefined says we deployed nft on network.
now how users will get that nft in their wallet?
undefined says do we need to send them manually?
undefined says or users can mint nft
undefined says There is no separate blog about this right now
undefined says so we have to list them on marketplace?
undefined says Check the link I just shared above, it already shows an example of how to mint NFT
undefined says ok i will check
undefined says if i want to send funds to an unverified phone number with no associated account, i dont see how i could send them funds without going to escrow first
undefined says Is from an escrow contract, but can't find how to wait until they verify their phone number if they didn't already. It seems to work only with verified numbers.
undefined says hello sers
undefined says im trying to verify a contract with hardhat
undefined says using doc provided in: https://docs.celo.org/es/blog/hardhat-deploy-verify, but im stuck on this
`npx hardhat --network alfajores sourcify
Error HH303: Unrecognized task sourcify`
undefined says anyone knows why is this? thanks in advance
undefined says the transfer and withdraw functions in the Escrow.sol contract will help you understand how this works. https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/e8a06c94c71a1ab78d6f139810eeb7da28083cd4/packages/protocol/contracts/identity/Escrow.sol#L96

you can also reach out to the valora team in their discord to ask about how they implement it https://valoraapp.co/discord
undefined says i just tried and its working for me. did you install hardhat deploy? `npm install -D hardhat-deploy`
undefined says yes ser
undefined says it should be done right after deployment or doesnt matter?
undefined says i deployed the contract some days ago
undefined says it shouldnt matter as long as you still have the deployment metadata. its weird that hardhat isn't recognizing the sourcify task. i believe it should be added when you add the hardhat-deploy plugin
undefined says weird
undefined says also got to say that i deployed it using a private key
undefined says not the namedaccounts provided in hre
undefined says Hi, MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION:
Anyone knows why this transaction is not being confirmed?
https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/0x25333543df602a6079f26ad844fc3a1d01728efe812add43ee273ec118fbaf3e/internal-transactions

We are using Blaize-Tech Java SDK for transactions. It used to work until a few days ago. Now all the transactions consistently get stuck in pending.
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says looks like the last successful tx has a nonce of 57, https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/0x09698cf161a71b5e05b2bae0b1ca5c20ec3e4e69b8b9d14d0d1c3e5cf22b0a40/token-transfers

the one's with a nonce higher than 58 won't process until the one with nonce 58 processes. is there one with nonce 58? i didnt see one
undefined says Could be. Since in development we passed 0 as gas fee at one point. And seems like from then on, nothing worked.
So what is to be done to fix it? Is the wallet done for? Like if this happens in a real life scenario the person would NOT be able to even move their assets
undefined says 58 to 94 are all pending transactions
undefined says If I remember correctly, if the client is not setting a different lifetime for the tx pool, the txs are pruned every 3 hours by default
undefined says It stopped working since 30 Dec. I don't even know what a tx pool lifetime is!
undefined says Mmmm, I don't know how blockscout manages the evictions. @Valentin | cLabs are we are handling those cases?
undefined says It won't delete the transaction but if there is a new TX with nonce 58 accepted by the node, it should pick up the rest
undefined says no its not done for. if tx with nonce 58 has a gas price of 0, just send a new tx with nonce 58 and a higher gas price and the rest should go (as long as they are valid txs as well)
undefined says are there any api docs that can give me information about all the JSON RPC methods request and responses ?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain#programmatically-interfacing-geth-nodes
undefined says let me know if you have any specific questions
undefined says Hi everyone , I have a question , May anyone know about Celo and NFTshelp me out !
undefined says idk exactly how to query NFTs and their owner from the Celo blockchain and what restrictions and costs
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says NFTs on Celo typically follow the ERC721 standard like NFTs on other EVM compatible chains. On a given an NFT contract, you can determine a specific token's owner by reading the `ownerOf` method, passing the token id. it will return the address of the owner. there is no cost to read data from the blockchain. 

do you need to query many NFTs, or just a few? the graph (https://thegraph.com/en/) is an indexing service that makes it easier to get large amounts of data from the blockchain. this post has info about using the graph https://docs.celo.org/blog/using-the-graph

Is it possible to solve and get verification done?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says Any celo developer interested in joining a team?
undefined says Hi folks, I've found a weird situation where Celo explorer is reporting that cUSD was sent from a wallet that never previously had a deposit of cUSD. I'm wondering if it's possible that some (perhaps very early) transactions are not recorded on Celo Explorer.
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/deploy-truffle#verify-smart-contract
undefined says maybe @Valentin | cLabs can help
undefined says this might be helpful. it makes it easy to turn all of the contract dependencies into one file. https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-flattener
undefined says Hey @Pinotio.com | Gov. Working Group, could you share a link to the transaction so I could check?
undefined says @joshc Thank you for the suggestion,
flattener didn’t help but I managed to solve this issue by directly interacting with https://sourcify.dev/

The contract is partially verified, without libraries, but this is enough for the correct display of transactions in the block scout
undefined says cool, im glad you solved it
undefined says Noted
undefined says Thank you
undefined says Hi, i want to pull all the transactions about a contract regarding one of the tokens on it. On celo_explorer I can only retrieve CELO token transactions in csv format. How can achieve the same but for a different token on that same CELO contract?
undefined says hi, i'm already created token on Celo and now i have plan to distribute token to members for free. i want to know do you have any way or suggestion to distribute token into many address in the same time?
undefined says Hey guys, quick question. What's the size of the database for your blockscout instance? Like, how many GBs are you currently using up in the block explorer to store all the data?
undefined says Highlighting to @joshc
undefined says Hey @Valentin | cLabs , appreciate the answer. I was slow replying because I wanted to get permission from the wallet owner to share the wallet address. (I know addresses are public, but still). I haven't heard back but will ping you if I do.
undefined says @Valentin | cLabs can probably help with this
undefined says @Valentin | cLabs can you help me with this?
undefined says U should just write a web3 script to query Forno and inspect all transactions
undefined says Hi @JoaquinMoreno, check out https://explorer.celo.org/api-docs#token the `?module=token&action=tokentx&contractaddress={contractAddressHash}&fromBlock={blockNumber}&toBlock={blockNumber}` method. Is it something you're looking for?
undefined says is it normal that verification takes that long on alfajores blockscout?
undefined says been trying for days with no success
undefined says i'm trying to verify a contract that uses imports from @openzeppelin/contracts
undefined says is there a pipeline for this? i've tried both hardhat and truffle and none worked

undefined says unfortunately it didn't work ser, it was already set to istanbul by default
undefined says just tried on rinkeby and worked fine
undefined says 0x45 = GasLimit. Celo doesn't have that opcode. Also does not have difficulty (0x44).
GasLimit is governable and it's part of the BlockchainParameters core contract. And the difficulty it is not required because we don't have reorgs due to our consensus (in our case you can think the difficulty as the blocknumber)

undefined says Hi, I have a quick question about setting up a celo node. If I wanted to set one node up does anyone know the upload / down minimum bandwidth requirements and what the estimated monthly data usage is?
undefined says full node is about 500G per month up and down, when peer count is capped to 64
undefined says when u increase the peer count, it gets more gossipy
undefined says u can tune the peercount to somewhat control ur monthly bandwidth
undefined says send and receive is about 300KB/s to 700KB/s, busy blocks u will have 1MB/s or more, these are all very manageable rates
undefined says Try removing the `--mainnet` flag and using the `--alfajores` flag instead. Those flags control what genesis block the client expects.

undefined says @EzraCelo I think there is something weird going on with Alfajores. I'm having similar issues like @icepoint .  I'm sending a tx that reverts with Error: out of gas. When I top up the gas the tx goes through but consumes way less gas than the original gas limit (that reverted). This issues is new and came out of nowhere.
The screenshot shows to tx to the same function. If the gas limit is set to 165k it consumes 47k, if the limit is set to 65k it consumes >65k. I can not make sense of it.

undefined says i can't tell till i know what you're exactly doing

Yeah hi @Martín Volpe | cLabs ,

 @Patrick and I were chatting about the roadmap for cStables and curious what is on the cards. We are both interested in seeing cBTC, cMXN, cRMB and cPHP come to life soon.

What is currently planned?

How can we help push this forward, while keeping some coordination across the ecosystem?
undefined says What is the usdt address and usdc address on Celo blockchain?
undefined says you can find token addresses of tokens bridged via optics by logging in here, https://optics.app/ and then click on your address in the top right
undefined says @yaz Can you provide me with large alfajores tesnet test coins? I need about 50000. My address is 0xac2fbbc12ce75158c38c5ca34efbb6343afdcb3. Thank you
undefined says The current stable deployment process is explained here: https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/stability/adding_stable_assets
it has quite a lot of overhead, so we're currently working on scoping some contract updates that'll allow us to deploy stable tokens with just one proposal. Will share updates soon!

undefined says Hi everybody, just wanted to share the forum post about baklava and the recent security fix https://forum.celo.org/t/on-baklava-stall-security-vulnerability-fixed-on-1-5-2/2776

Thanks for the support and the patience!
undefined says I have updated to the latest docker 1.5.2 with the fix and have started my full node with this version. However it is doing the full chain syncing from the beginning and it's going to take more than one day to sync. Next time do I have a way to avoid syncing all over again?
undefined says official snapshot urls:
```

https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/baklava/chaindata-2022-01-28.tar.gz
```
undefined says Great thanks, and I see I can reuse my past chaindata as well, does not need to be rebuilt from the beginning with the new version.
undefined says Usually to be safe, I actually take the cloud backup (they have new ones every day I think, just change the date number), and strip out all but the `ancient` folder and only restore from ancient
undefined says If an independent dev want to help port over improvements & bug fixes from Go-Ethereum over to Celo-Blockchain, is there a bounty program in place for such contributions?

Specifically, I would like to port over these upstream performance & consistency related PRs from Geth:
<https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23566>
<https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23105>
<https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/24189>

Mainly to improve `core/rawdb/accessors_chain.go`
undefined says @RAinUsTa we periodically merge upstream improvements to the code. As of 1.5.x, we are merged up to 1.10.7 from upstream. In time those will get merged. We do sometimes cherry pick urgent fixes however.
undefined says When will the next upstream merge happen? and will it take up to something like 1.10.15?
There are other improvements I'm looking forward to.
undefined says No ETA. It will take some time to get there. And we avoid cherry picks unless they are of extreme importance since they do make merging more complicated afterwards
undefined says I finished this https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/mainnet/running-a-full-node-in-mainnet and my node is now running and synced, what's next?
undefined says once the full node is sync'ed you can use it for RPC APIs
undefined says Hello we have a node with `--syncmode full` and `--gcmode archive` setting and it's fully caught up, yet when we called the `eth_getTransactionByHash` endpoint on some TX the `gasPrice` is showed as  `null` (other field showed the correct value). It doesn’t seem to be effecting all TXs but some, would it be related to the above pruning settings?

```

undefined says There's a condition where that can happen according to the RPC code, I'll get more info and get back to you
undefined says but it's about how the information is presented, nothing is wrong with the state of the node

undefined says but not sure. I'll probably have an answer tomorrow
undefined says Yeap, bug. I'll create an issue for it

undefined says Hi, my baklava nodes are still failing since the baklava network failure, has this been fixed yet ? or do i need to resync from scratch ?
undefined says @Mariano | cLabs @yaz
undefined says The network has not restarted producing blocks yet, although I had thought it would based on my investigation so far. I'm looking in to what more we need to do to get the network running again.
undefined says If needed, we can coordinate a restart event among the Baklava validators, but I have avoided that so far to respect everyone's time.
undefined says I'm seeing  `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable` on explorer.celo.org right now

undefined says not sure, I am seeing these on my subgraph as well. I am asking the data services team. maybe @Valentin | cLabs can help
undefined says Hi, I'm having an issue when I start docker with geth console, it just quits. any easy way I can run a node and attach to it. I'd prefer something even lighter like regtest so I don't have to sync anything but I don't think that exists on CELO, right?

undefined says Hi guys, good to see you guys
undefined says I have a question about the drawback of address-based encryption. As information mentioned in whitepaper, transaction transparency will be solved by implementing ZK-snacks.  But I can still track my transaction explorer. is there something I misunderstand here?
undefined says 
undefined says Highlighting to @Valentin | cLabs
undefined says hello, Celo sushi rewards halved?
undefined says Please check @Nikhil | Celo Foundation recent comment in #🏠︱general
undefined says Hi @Diego_2101, you should be able to see the transactions. The whitepaper describes a drawback of a simplified version of the address-based encryption (note that it's not the one that is being used), when a user could deduce addresses of their contacts based only on their phone numbers (not knowing their actual account addresses). Let me know if it helps.
undefined says Thank you for your answer!  but the contacts based on phone numbers mean spammers can harvest their phone numbers to do bad things?
undefined says Hi thanks for the updates. wonder if there are any responses? 🙂
undefined says I think it is related to the empty `gasPrice` field in some transactions. I am connecting with folks at the graph to get more detail
undefined says Thanks so much! Looking forward to its back online
undefined says Hello hope you are all having a great day ?
undefined says Hello conover, we are doing great, thanks. How about you? You should move this discussion to #🏠︱general unless you have any technical queries which you can post here.
undefined says May be a noob question, but does anyone know if it's possible to see the *arguments* of internal transaction calls for transactions on Celo Explorer?
undefined says I see a listing of internal transaction calls of course, but not the arguments that those calls were provided.
undefined says Highlighting to @Valentin | cLabs
undefined says hey there, i've upgraded my baklava nodes to 1.5.3 but the validator still does not seem to start. I have a pastebin of the log, but i'm unsure f it contains any sensitive information. Who can I send it to ?
undefined says @yaz @EzraCelo
undefined says @yaz might be able to help you about this
undefined says @Valentin | cLabs Any potential leads on this? I'm trying to debug a contract I've deployed but it's very difficult to debug revert reasons without knowing internal transaction arguments :/
undefined says Does Celo Explorer provide the *entire* raw trace? It seems like it's getting cut off. The revert reason given for my contract call does not correspond to the final stack trace in the "raw trace" section.
undefined says Does forno support any  `trace_*` JSON RPC calls?
undefined says ignore that last question, seems like it doesn't.
undefined says Hey, @jophish, I think the closest would be indeed the Raw Trace section. What's getting cut off exactly? Could you share some examples?
undefined says Hello, does Celo Explorer provide an API for getting the all assets balance by an address?
undefined says Perhaps you are looking for this

undefined says Hello At the moment I am using `celocli exchange` to exchange CELO vs cUSD, I would like to use buy sell instead I think it is faster as it avoids the increase allowance step. How can I buy / sell with celocli ?
undefined says any news about this ? @yaz
undefined says for example this tx is a sell `0x27d5739611367b8ea63362746a92a48080f58c7441ceab10e7176ff861c939b8` not requiring the increase allowance step. This is what I would like to achieve with `celocli` if possible.
undefined says @kewl https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0x53c4bbeecb7266e6878bcf0ffbf72d76fb1a968f3d5c7f47e8755ebf27a2f11d/internal-transactions
That was the previous approval of that tx
You will always require to approve an amount that the contract could "extract from you".
You can always approve an infinite amount, and just use the exchange function directly from the contract, but either way, you'll first need to allow the exchange contract to extract a value from your address
undefined says Are you seeing any error in the logs?
undefined says yes, can i send it to you in private ?
undefined says understood thanks - is approving an infinite amount something I can do with celocli? basically what I want to avoid is the increase allowance that takes time and costs gas every time I do an exchange.
Or another way than celocli is fine too :coinhug: 
(how do I "use the exchange function directly from the contract"?)
undefined says yes sure
undefined says I think it wasn't added as a command in the celocli, and even if you have it, for what I'm checking in the exchange command, we always do the approve + exchange, without checking if already have or not allowance.  So, the short answer is not, but maybe you can ping the general-core to check if someone from `applications` can tell you if it is part of the roadmap or not. To be completely honest, probably is not something that will be addressed soon, because with the cost of gas at this moment, this is not that critical.
undefined says @Valentin | cLabs I was able to decode the `input` fields of the raw trace entries against various contract ABIs, however it looks as if the stack trace gets cut off at 50 calls. I'm also unsure if the pagination for internal transactions is working correctly.
undefined says @jophish could you share specific examples so we could confirm the issue?
undefined says Can I PM you a link to a TX?
undefined says Yes, of course.
undefined says Great, ty
undefined says I have a question, within the same block which transaction is executed first ? is it the transaction with the highest gas price, limit, is it in the order of arrival or some other factors?
undefined says same ordering as on Ethereum, highest gas first
undefined says It is not that obvious on ethereum, transactions that origin from the miner node will often be put first, specifically in Celo's case what are the priority rules within a bloc? Does it involve gas limit as well as gas price, any other parameter that could affect the priority?
Eventually is it possible for a validator to use its own priority rule within the block?
undefined says there are some validators that whitelisted oracle reporting addresses, but so far if you are concerned about MEV, that isn't happening on Celo yet.
undefined says All right, so gas price should be the only priority criteria, I was concerned about MEV, thanks
undefined says There is pretty intense priority gas auction right now though
undefined says Players in PGA:

<https://explorer.celo.org/address/0xDCB543E8a04B5b516D93F314E8E33880a74f9705/transactions>
They're not super successful though and actually lose coins pretty frequently due to backrunners 😦
undefined says is it GameFi on Celo?
undefined says ? priority gas auction, arb bots competing for profits
undefined says I see, with 30+ Gwei and 3000000+ gas limit !  some of them seem to be doing complex stuff with several CELO/cREAL/USD/mcUSD operations in the same transaction, not sure what they are arbitraging
undefined says its cyclical arbitrage
undefined says pure profit
undefined says I see they are abitraging between Dexes, which ones ?
undefined says Hey All, thank you to everyone who tuned in to the State of the Network. I asked the question "How will Celo add support for Venmo-like privacy?". Thank you @marek | clabs, Valora ◘ for your response. I would encourage everyone to continue the discussion in this feature request https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/discussions/9293

undefined says hello there I am an android dev. I want to integrate celo in android. I found some docs from celo's website but it is only for wallet creation, restore and query.
undefined says I want to store data in blockchain using celo. Like some words or letters or an image
undefined says is it possible using celo?
undefined says It's certainly possible to store data on the Celo chain using a transaction or smart contract. I would strongly discourage you from doing so for anything but short strings of data (e.g. a link or content hash of a file stored elsewhere).
undefined says Yeah I just want to store the hashes of fingerprint data. 
It would be really helpful if you can share some resources related to the same. (For android dev)
undefined says Is the time between blocks exactly 5 sec or can it vary by a few ms or more? Is there a way to know when will be the next block time (I need a precision of about 100ms)?
undefined says Hello, "walue@walue-ABRA-A5-V15-4:~/Desktop/CELO2/celo-blockchain/build/bin$ ./mycelo genesis --buildpath $CELO_MONOREPO/packages/protocol/build/contracts/" this code when I want to run it it gives me this ("execution reverted") message. What should I do?
undefined says Hi, this is "./build/bin/mycelo genesis-from-config build/bin/envvv/" when I try to run it it gives me this ("execution reversed") message. ctx.deployAccounts failed in this deploySteps step. What should I do? Please help me.
undefined says Goodday,  where can I get the genesis.json file of celo mainnet?
undefined says This might be useful https://forum.celo.org/t/release-v1-1-0-of-celo-blockchain/616
@yaz might be able to tell more
undefined says Thanks ill check it out and ill also be expecting @yaz  comment.
undefined says it's already built in to the geth client
undefined says I need the hard forks, bootstrap nodes and genesis state .
undefined says There's some really funky transaction ordering in this block:
https://explorer.celo.org/block/11811271/transactions
undefined says There's a bug in Celo's Geth with regard to how transaction paying for gas with cUSD are ordered in the block.
It doesn't seem to be ordered correctly in relation to transactions paying for gas with Celo.
undefined says Nvm, looks like in block explorer, the gas price quoted is in the cUSD price, and not converted to Celo gas price
undefined says Hello, I'm trying to run Celo in my local by networking for about 1 week. While running Mycelo, I get an error in the exchange contract deploy mycelo>genesis>genesis_state.go>ctx.deployExchanges() section. What is the cause of this problem? What can i do to solve this? The error message I get is "execution reverted".
undefined says Highlighting to @yaz
undefined says Is there a time range for the next block time? Like the next timestamp cannot occur in less than `x` seconds and should occur before `y` seconds? `x` and `y` being around 5 seconds I suppose.
undefined says it's constant at 5 seconds per block
undefined says thanks my question is 5 sec plus or minus how many ms (depending on some events for example)? do you mean 5 sec +/- 0 ms  ?
undefined says Another question, does the exchange rate cUSD / CELO of the reserve varies between 2 blocks or is it only updated at every timestamp ?
undefined says it's 5 seconds as it's a constant block time due to the architecture of IBFT. in extreme bad case scenarios, (due to a good amount of validators not signing blocks, a block timestamp can be delayed longer than 5 seconds, but super duper rare)
undefined says I see thanks and what about the exchange rate update frequency, is it updated within two timestamps?  It does not seem so from what I can observe
undefined says I always get a timeout prompt when I use truffle deploy contracts. It’s hard to deploy successfully.  Why?
undefined says how are you connecting to the celo network? what RPC endpoint are you using?
undefined says I use this rpc url, https://forno.celo.org
undefined says And I used truffle
undefined says shouldn't full nodes (like forno) return all the historical transactions?
Like 0x9c9ab7fa49e6fd2f8d7bcfcd397dd2ea23da2403815e2fa6b86beeed016f6bba from block 7865768.
Right now it returns null:
```
curl --location --request POST "https://forno.celo.org" \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getTransactionByHash",
    "params": [
        "0x9c9ab7fa49e6fd2f8d7bcfcd397dd2ea23da2403815e2fa6b86beeed016f6bba"
    ],
    "id": 1
}'

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":null}
```
undefined says there were some problems with forno yesterday, they should be resolved now. if you are still seeing this issue can you share your truffle config file?
undefined says Raising this, I've already checked and we have a TxLookup that is not infinite but ~4 months. We should at least allow the user query for the last year (imho) but I'll try to change it to infinite again. I'll let you know when the changes were addressed
undefined says @lastperson You should check now, we've addressed the changes to have that working on forno. (Just as a warning, as we have a cluster of nodes, and every node has to reindex the txs, and as to avoid downtime, we made that sequentially, it's possible that your request gets to a node that was not already finished that process... give it a little time, but I'm already receiving responses)
undefined says I actually set my own full node TX lookup index to only 1 week to save on index space. Having a large index does cause a lot of disk space to be consumed, and I feel like historical TX lookups are better serviced by Figment archive node service rather than Forno.
undefined says Yes, it works. Thanks!
undefined says works now! appreciate the prompt resolution!
undefined says Yes, agree. But as forno always had it as infinite, if we decide to actually have 1 year, it's something we should communicate first, instead of switching it just because a default changed. The idea is having the default as a year in the client, and also we are discussing if we are changing it or not on forno, but if we decide to change it, we will communicate with time enough for others to change their implementation (if needed)
undefined says Is Celo network experiencing some problems or why I can’t sent mUSD to my Valora address?

I have enough gas. I am using MM Wallet. 

TXN hash: 0x41bd8a23cdfa0d988ab280a084e920e9b4122573e39397a6d425bafef28f83ce

undefined says We are currently seeing a number of out-of-gas transactions due to estimates being low. We are deploying a mitigation to Forno now, and are continuing to look into the issue. If you increase the gas value manually, you should be able to avoid this issue as well.
undefined says the number of transactions on Celo network with `feeCurrency` != `Celo` is actually more frequent than I expect, very interesting to see people use `cUSD` for gas.
undefined says I put up my own public HTTP RPC node at https://celo.uns.top
Free for public consumption.
undefined says We deployed the new celo-blockchain version (v1.5.5: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/releases/tag/v1.5.5) to forno that should relieve the gas underestimations we have seen since Tuesday. If you are operating/using a custom node to make your calls and suffering gasEstimation problems, upgrading is also recommended.
undefined says Hey guys, after getting the `gasUsed` and `gasPrice` in the transaction details, how can I calculate the transaction `Total Transaction Fee` ? Just like the one shown here. I thought it was going to be like Ethereum but my numbers don't add up.
undefined says its because that TX decided to use cEUR as the fee currency.
undefined says the gas price in that TX is denominated in cEUR
undefined says I know, I just want to calculate that value on my end because it is not part of the transaction details returned by the API. For example, I know in Ethereum we can use this ```Gas units (limit) * Gas price per unit i.e 21,000 * 200 = 4,200,000 gwei or 0.0042 ETH``` then `0.0042 ETH` will be the `Transaction fee`. I want to do the same calculation but for CELO. How do I get the `Transaction Fee`?
undefined says its the exact same formula for Celo
undefined says you take the `gas used by tx` and multiply by `gas price`
undefined says Hello, how can I add approver address in Mycelo.
undefined says Hi everyone! We were wondering with my team if in the bridging process, Celo creates a wrapped token or we can tell it to send the tokens to a contract that we created on Celo?
undefined says Is there a similar service to https://mapper.polygon.technology/ to bridge a deployed ethereum erc20 token with a deployed celo token?
undefined says Could you clarify your question a bit. You are using the `mycelo` command in the `celo-blockchain` repo?
undefined says Not sure I understand the question, so you may want to rephrase a bit, but you will also have better luck on the #🌉bridging channel or in the Optics discord server if you are using Optics.
undefined says He was referring to this: https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/666828186570588161/953357552706527243
undefined says Yes, I am learning celo at my local with mycelo on celo-blockchain. I wanted to learn the Governance mechanism. When I looked inside the code, it was using multisig. It was using the GovernanceApproveMultisig.sol contract. It has been added as an approve address. I solved my question. Thank you for your return.
undefined says Hello, I have a question about optics-monorepo. I need to solve this today. I really need this. Please help me.  I want to run optics-monorepo in my local.

undefined says No restrictions. In general, the Celo EVM is identical to Ethereum's with a few extra precompiles and the op codes for difficulty and max gas removed.
undefined says and best of all, u can pay for TX with any of the cStable currency!
undefined says @icepoint if ur not seeing correct debugging trace from blockscout, then run ur own debug node

undefined says https://github.com/orgs/celo-org/repositories?language=python&type=all 
According to this page, I don't think we have a Python lib for that
undefined says Just take the core contract ABI and code gen your own stubs, contract kit is just shim wrapper around the core contracts, can always just call them directly
undefined says Is there a wallet to support CELO's NFT? I can't see it in many wallets

undefined says Hi Everyone 
i am running celo node using docker it starts syncing but it is very slow and also not able to get data of transactions i am only getting the last block no synced .i am using this command to clone the node 
```
docker run --name celo-fullnode -d --restart unless-stopped --stop-timeout 300 -p 127.0.0.1:8545:8545 -p 127.0.0.1:8546:8546 -p 30303:30303 -p 30303:30303/udp -v $PWD:/root/.celo $CELO_IMAGE --verbosity 3 --syncmode full --http --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.api eth,net,web3,debug,admin,personal --light.serve 90 --light.maxpeers 1000 --maxpeers 1100 --etherbase $CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --datadir /root/.celo
```
also i want to know if i want to start a node from specific block .
undefined says Use fast sync instead
undefined says can i get any documentation for fast sync
undefined says Hi folks - what's the easiest way for me to get historical staking and validator rewards for a given Celo address? Is that available in any of the explorers? I noticed `rewards:show` in the CLI, but that requires an archive node, and I saw a GH issue that it may not be accurate. Ideally I want to be able to export each epoch reward for that address into a CSV.
undefined says This arb contract <https://explorer.celo.org/address/0xf93525b95856fE1F1CCD37420bA4ef5dd060D408/token-transfers> is basically getting brute force spammed every single block. Annoying as F cus it's cluttering up the network.

It's hit ratio is really poor based on token transfers.
undefined says @RAinUsTa  I was checking the same. Raising this
undefined says i think they're just pissed off that <https://explorer.celo.org/address/0x3ed6e82D2d45c26Fe426D8df1Ad51cefF5f3cC40/token-transfers> is eating the pie
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs @Martín Volpe | cLabs hey Guys @Cactus Sediento is working on a stable stablecoin and trying to base it off of cREAL/cEUR smart contracts. Can they ask some questions here?
undefined says Hi guys. The idea is to build an historically stable stablecoin. A coin that revalue the same amount as the inflation expected ( and corrects deviations). So if one ssd is one dollar today and the dollar has 3 percent of inflation next year, one ssd will be 1.03 dollars next year. And so on. I have been looking https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/stability/StableToken.sol and cgp42 and 45 for creal deployment. Are we well addressed?
undefined says What if Celo team specifically block an address from token transfer? The power to amend algorithm lies with the Celo team, no? The same way the admins of Celo Discord server ban users at their own will.
undefined says Hey guys, I found a bug while implementation

undefined says Seeing some major problems with Forno WSS today
undefined says is it getting DDOSed?
undefined says On monday when people are back at the office, please resurrect Forno WSS, it's down for 12 hours+, thanks.
undefined says Hi, I'm trying to run a full Celo Node on AWS, but I can't connect to the Node. Can somebody help me how to connect to the Node?
undefined says Security Groups should be fine cause I can connect to the Node via Putty in unauthorized Mode, but then I am not able to log in. Not sure if the Key File should log me in directly or if I now need a user/password Combination for the Node I can not find anywhere.
undefined says You shoudn't use the default AMI images, those are not great for competitive back running
undefined says haha, you are the best!
undefined says already switched to the containerized ones and hosting these on AWS. at least geth config can be changed there. more optimizations can then follow after everything runs then.
undefined says want to build quite a custom implementation/configuration of the Node anyway in the future, but for now the standard one with tweaked Configs needs to be enough 😄
undefined says the full nodes for Celo is a LOT easier to run than the ones for Gnosis, i tried to run Gnosis full RPC node at home on a laptop and it almost chewed through my SSD  doing TBs of writes
undefined says i think gnosis side there's a lot higher barrier to entry because running full nodes require quite a bit more CPU, ram, and SSD
undefined says Celo full nodes honestly can even be run on hard drive once the network is fully synced
undefined says especially if you only need mempool I guess 😄
undefined says mempool is the only one that matters
undefined says nobody looks back into history
undefined says yes, have a crazy plan for optimizing for that 😄
undefined says but first of all I need to get the Node running, something is wrong with my AWS ECS Config. Hope to fix it tomorrow, after that I will take my bot with the new Algo live and then we will see if I stand a chance with you haha
undefined says but after all this is done I have an really crazy optimization Idea and if that works I will never have Mempool Issues again haha
undefined says I guess it's not such a bad thing that Forno WSS has been down throughout this whole Celo pump, it shows your which bots on the network are running on their own dedicated nodes.
undefined says Is there a tutorial to arrange the whole node on your own computer
undefined says you could install docker and then run the Node in Docker.
undefined says Where is the docker image address
undefined says I believe this may help you out.🙂

undefined says Hey, I am trying to retrieve the base fee for Celo in order to calculate gas fees, however I am getting an error message when I try to use this method "eth_feeHistory" to POST this endpoint: `https://celo-alfajores--rpc.datahub.figment.io/apikey/${process.env.CELO_NODE_API_KEY}/`

Payload is: { "id": 44787, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_feeHistory", "params": ["0x1", "latest", []] };

Error is: {"error": {"code": -32601, "message": "the method eth_feeHistory does not exist/is not available"}, "id": 44787, "jsonrpc": "2.0"}

Any help appreciated!
undefined says Celo doesn't have eth_feeHistory, if you just want to know the current network gas price, use ContractKit
undefined says We want to avoid using dependencies, is there any other way to get the gas fee?
undefined says take the ABI from <https://explorer.celo.org/address/0xDfca3a8d7699D8bAfe656823AD60C17cb8270ECC/read-proxy> and generate your own Web3 binding for that contract, it will give u the gas fee
undefined says if you want to know the gas price for some historical block, then you will need a Figment archive node, and query that gas price contract at a prior block number
undefined says Hey guys, any available celo blockchain devs here?

undefined says Hello All ,

I have a celo-rosetta node up and running with version v0.9.1 but unfurtunately that stopped today and when i tried to start it its getting stopped after few minutes , Can any one help here . Attaching the log file .
undefined says 
undefined says I'm thinking @Ponti | cLabs can assist here.
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs Can you please take a look .
undefined says hi all
undefined says quick question, if I call a method to a contract at the wrong address,  I don't get an error and looks like the transactions worked, I was expecting a fail in here
undefined says how you address this?
undefined says For ContractKit, how are the the "baseFeePerGas" and the "maxPriorityFeePerGas" values derived as Celo docs state it's using eip-1559 gas standard
undefined says I dont think i've ever seen a eip 1559 tx on celo, you can see details on <https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0042.md>
I think it's partially implemented, and I run all of my transactions the old fashioned way with just the base gas, and things work just fine
undefined says hi, I'm just syncing my Celo node and from time to time I get an error message, just wondering if I can/should just ignore that error, or if sth is wrong. The Error is:  Error invoking evm function: EVM call failure to=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ce10 method=getAddressFor input=0xdd927233235a6f54090e9b94aa4e585a699c4375a2ff8f572c68114d138f0ed121527849 maxgas=100,000 err="execution reverted" message="No Implementation set"
undefined says this happens while syncing, so is no response to an rpc call or sth.
undefined says it goes away once the node is fully sync'ed, so just sit tight and wait it out
undefined says Haha, you are my personal Celo support, thx 😅😂😂
undefined says Wasn't sure what channel to post this question in, but does the testnet mimic mainnet? Meaning, can I test how a proposal would affect the reserve/block rewards/price action when key parameters are changed? Is there a testnet for testing CIPs for unintended consequences? If not, what is the best practice for testing a proposal like "Proof-of-Deposit" before putting the proposal forward? Thank you in advance 🙏
undefined says 
undefined says Sorry about late reply, could you please provide more logs on this? The log you provided is from geth and it doesn't say much about the problem
undefined says The client code and contracts on Alfajores & Baklava are identical to main net, so you have all technical parts there for you to run against. 
However I think testnets lack real world incentives if you want to test economic effects. E.g. we have Mento on Alfajores/Baklava/Mainnet, but I am not sure if you can test stability of cSTABLES on Alfajores/Baklava simply by changing parameters
undefined says I cannot deploy the Upgradeable contract using hardhat
undefined says @joshc Might be able to answer this!
undefined says Is anyone learning with dacade here?
undefined says Celo development 101
undefined says Hello devs, 

I have read the identity protocol but one key point is not clear.  I could understand the pepper generation in this link - https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/odis. I also could understand that there is a limitation in the number of possible peppers a user can query. What is not clear to me is how a user (user "A") can find the pepper of a user "B" to discover the Celo address of user "B" if user "A" does not have the initial key that user "B" used to sign the original BLS message.
undefined says I replied to this for you in the other channel you asked in.🙂
undefined says try manually setting the gas limit. is this on alfajores?
undefined says i am not sure how the pepper is generated. @eela | cLabs or @0xArthur.xyz | cLabs may have an answer

as far as querying other accounts, anyone can query another users pepper, all you need is their phone number. you don't need any keys that another user used to register their number. a user just needs to query ODIS from their own Celo account and there query limits based on that accounts activity
undefined says The first step of this pic is to "BLIND (Phone number)". The description is "When a client queries ODIS to get an OPRF evaluation, the client first blinds the phone number locally using a secret one-time key.  This blinding process preserves the privacy of underlying message (e.g. a mobile number or password) such that ODIS nodes won't learn any of the user's sensitive information. In addition to protecting the user's privacy, it reduces the risk of targeted censorship."
undefined says My question is: how is this blind done? If it uses a secret key of the user's phone, how other users can query the phone number?
undefined says if it does not use a secret key from the user's phone, where does this key come from?
undefined says Just a question, call for assistance,  for a developer who could assist us learn celo and progress very practically. We have an international project well adapted to Celo features such as low cost, friction less, phone based, below censure, We have done the basic research: now we would like to implement a prototype of the Dapp on the chain. I am just learning the basics of Solidity, Truffle...Github in books and online courses, but sometime time consuming, and not super clear. . Anyone can help us going through the basics so we can move forward on our own, with assistance, Thks for feedback of how best to proceed.:celo:
undefined says Hey @Marc12, 
You can refer to this article by joe on learning the basics and getting started with Celo Progressive Dappstarter. 
https://medium.com/celodevelopers/building-for-the-celo-connect-mobile-hackathon-a78707b7431c
Also you can refer to the docs and can navigate through according to your specific needs. 
https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/overview

Cheers!:celo:
undefined says Hi, what is the easiest way to access mempool data? Custom node or some service? Thanks 🙂
undefined says So the way this works is that the blinding factor, this one-time key generated by the client, is only used to blind/"encrypt" the query that is sent to ODIS. When ODIS responds, the client removes this blinding factor so the final result does not depend on what blinding factor the user chooses (e.g. If users B and C both send the phone number for user A to ODIS, they will use different blindings such that the requests look different, but the result is the same: user A's pepper).

Another way to put this is that the overall protocol implements a keyed PRF/"hash function" `F(k, m)` where `k` is the secret key held by ODIS and `m` is the message held by the client. In this protocol, the client learns the output of `F(k, m)` but learns nothing about the secret key. The server(s) learn nothing about the message. The blinding factor is what ensures that the server learns nothing about the input message. You'll notice here that the function output only depends on the ODIS secret key and the message, in particular the blinding factor has no influence on the output. As a result, multiple clients that use their own random blinding factors will all get the same result.
undefined says Sorry for a bit of a slow response. Let me know if you want to talk about this more.
undefined says Listen to pending tx via forno
undefined says Thanks! Could you pls point me to some docs or what api / socket to use?
undefined says https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/49420/monitoring-pending-transactions works the same on Celo as it does on Eth, forno provides the pending TX subscription endpoint
undefined says hi everyone, just joined
undefined says i managed to get a light celo node running but cant subscribe to pending transactions
undefined says has anybody encountered this issue?
undefined says i dont get an error or anything, just no txs show up using the same script that works for other chains
undefined says and also i have 36 fixed peers all the time
undefined says Thank you 👍
undefined says Stop using light node and use a full node or forno
undefined says What r u guys trying to build?
undefined says whats the point of having light nodes then?
undefined says nothing yet just playing around
undefined says Hello Victor.  Thank you for explaining this. I am still trying to understand. In your explanation, you used F(k,m) where k is the secret key held by ODIS and m is the message held by the client. This was clear. What is the result of this F function? The pepper of a user, correct? Also,  I understood that k never changes, correct? 
What I still could not understand is how different messages m and m’ will both produce the same result. Because if users B and C both send the phone number for user A to ODIS They will produce different messages, let’s say m and m’. Are you saying that F(k,m) will produce the same result that F(k,m’)? What is wrong with my thought?
undefined says > What is the result of this F function? The pepper of a user, correct?
Correct, this is the ODIS OPRF function and the result is the pepper when the input is a phone number. And correct, k does not change, it is the key shared among ODIS nodes.
> Are you saying that F(k,m) will produce the same result that F(k,m’)? What is wrong with my thought?
So in this case F is the logical function that is actually split across the client and server. If the phone number is the same for users B and C then m is that phone number and is the same for both clients. They will blind it using their own secret values, so the server will see different blinded messages, but the underlying message will be the same in both cases.
undefined says Hey @victorgraf, thank you for replying.  I am so sorry for asking again but this is really important to understand.
Supposing again users B and C both sending the phone number for user A.
You said they will send to the server different messages (this is clear, because they used different client encryption). Supposing Mb and Mc.
Mb – message encrypted by user B to the phone number of A
Mc – message encrypted by user C to the phone number of A
How can the server arrive in the same result (that is the pepper of user A) if it receives different inputs (Mb and Mc)?
undefined says Light node is for cell phones that want to submit tx to full node peers
undefined says I see. This is unique to celo though, isnt it?
undefined says I recall being able to read txpool from an eth light node
undefined says I tried to set the gas and received the same error. This is in alfajores.
I suspect it's a problem with the upgrade contract. I received the same problem on other networks
undefined says You can try my code
undefined says So it's not so much that B and C "encrypt" the message to A, it's more that they "encrypt it to themselves". So the ODIS servers will receive the "encrypted" form of the message Mb or Mc, run a computation on it to create the responses Rb and Rc and send them back to B and C respectively. When B and C "decrypt" the responses, they will both yield the same result, the pepper for A.
undefined says I put encrypt in quotes because it's technically not encryption, we call it blinding in this context and it has slightly different properties, but it operates mostly the same way as if we'd encrypted it in this context.
undefined says were you able to resolve this on other networks?
undefined says Hum. Now I understood what you mean! Thank you for explaining!! Do you have any additional link about this blinding process? Is it a common crypto technique?
undefined says Just posted about Plumo to the forum 🙌 
https://forum.celo.org/t/plumo-demo-and-brainstorm/3367
undefined says I gave up the other network. They don't support the upgrade contract😅
undefined says It's used in blind signatures and oblivious pseudo-random functions (OPRF). ODIS is actually both of those things as it's based on blind BLS signatures. I'm having a hard time finding good resources on these systems, but here are the best two I could find. Although the term (blind) itself is mostly used in this context, it's similar to other techniques used in cryptography.

undefined says Hi!
Do you know an NFT contract which keeps track of holder addresses ?

Let's say I create an NFT contract, and 45 people mint my NFT, I want a function in my contract which returns these 45 addresses

I'm pretty sure someone already did it using OpenZeppelin ERC721Enumerable, but I can't find any examples

Any ideas ?
undefined says U just track the transfer events
undefined says i can help you on nft minting
undefined says So help me ? 🤣
undefined says Hello 🙂 
New to Celo blockchain.
Does Celo supports dynamic NFTs with re-writtable metadatas from external outputs, through oracle chain solutions?
undefined says You can write a custom NFT token contract to do whatever you want, it’s just a smart contract
undefined says can anyone help?
undefined says I can mint in different networks but when trying to mint in celo network it gives this error.
undefined says How do i find a testnet DEX
undefined says 
undefined says Today I learned that on Celo, if you send a EIP 1559 tx, you get back this error: `Network doesn't support eip-1559` 
😦 I guess it really is half implemented in Celo.
undefined says @RAinUsTa to which node are you submitting the transaction?
undefined says My own full node, running the celo blockchain Geth, is there some special flag to set to turn this on?
undefined says @RAinUsTa and which application are you using to send the tx to the node?
undefined says Web3
undefined says Nodejs
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0042.md still shows draft
undefined says So it isn’t implemented yet
undefined says No?
undefined says AFAIK the celo dynamic fee tx type (0x7c) has already been implemented and working since the espresso fork
undefined says I'll get back at you regarding that CIP
undefined says So what’s the rpc behavior if I don’t explicitly set type to 0x7c and just include the extra type2 fields?
undefined says Cus that’s how I’m running the eip 1559 tx
undefined says No explicit type 0x7c just the additional type2 gas priority fields
undefined says which RPC method is being used in this call?
undefined says (my hunch is that it's probably a client issue, but I could be wrong)
undefined says I think it is a client issue with no explicit type, will have to debug more
undefined says As far as I can tell, there’s very very little tx on celo with the eip 1559 fields
undefined says actually, if you use type 2 (which is the same as ethereum's eip-1559 tx type), it should also work, only that you can't define the FeeCurrency in the type2 tx
undefined says Hi, what are more or less the specifications required to run a full Celo node?
undefined says The vultr high frequency 4GB instance with 128G ssd is enough. Tune your tx lookup index period to 1 month and use fast sync.
undefined says @here 

When using celo for the testnet the alfajores remote node is in the docs. What would you use if you want to query the mainet ?
undefined says Forno.celo.org
undefined says I think this is the issue:
https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/v1.7.3/packages/web3-core-method/src/index.js#L872
Part of the check (of web3js) to know if the network is capable of doing a 1559 tx, is checking the baseFeePerGas field of the block, which we don't have. We are not using a baseFee in the block as ethereum does, mostly because we have it as part of our minimumGasPrice contract, and its multiple baseFees (for every whitelisted token).
So, this is a web3js limitation, but this bring us a possible incompatibility with the tools which I'll raise in our internal channel (cc @pastoh )
undefined says that `baseFeePerGas` missing, it's the one that end up raising the `throw Error("Network doesn't support eip-1559")` which you are seeing
undefined says that make a lot of sense and explains why i hardly ever see eip 1559 on the network, all of the dapps use web3.js and metamask doesn't think the network is eip 1559 compatible.

It doesn't seem to be a problem in practice though, cus everyone's TX still go through just fine and the median gas price is still 0.5gwei.
undefined says Thanks I'll try it tomorrow morning
undefined says Are there are ERC-721 bridges from Ethereum to Celo ?
undefined says Not at the moment.
undefined says you need to do break one by one,
undefined says https://github.com/celo-tools/celo-ethers-wrapper/issues/5
undefined says Hello, we are working with the Ocean protocol team to deploy to Alfajores, but we encountered this problem with JSON RPC compatibility, any suggestions?

undefined says Hi mates,
undefined says I am trying to setup hardhat for celo contract program. The guideline i found from here: https://medium.com/celodevelopers/hardhat-and-celo-the-ultimate-guide-to-deploy-celo-dapps-using-hardhat-747f42ad0788
undefined says When I running command: `npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network alfajores` i can find my contract in the testnet
undefined says But when i run it in localhost (I turned on Gauche server running in port 7545) with command `npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network localhost`
undefined says The output said that my contract is deployed: `Greeter deployed to: 0xE41f8Cf40A35566F19F34FBb856c5c84fE51Bc8A`
undefined says But when i open Gauche, i could not find my contract...
undefined says Should I have to add contract to Gauche workspace ? (i tried, but Gauche does not recognize a hardhat project)
undefined says Did you get similar issue or have experience on it ?
undefined says ( my source code is in here: https://github.com/andyle83/marketplace)
undefined says FYI: it seem this is not right place to ask. Anw, i solved my issue.
undefined says HI guys, is solidity the only language to program on celo?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Is there an archive RPC available on Celo?
undefined says hello guys
undefined says can we use valora on alfajores??
undefined says Would recommend posting about it on #📱valora
undefined says I think any EVM compatible languages: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/languages/
undefined says hey there
undefined says is there any docs on sending cUSD with web3.js without using contractkit?
undefined says This might help: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/24828/how-to-send-erc20-token-using-web3-api
undefined says yeah im sending it the classic way, but transaction is getting stucked
undefined says By getting stuck do you mean the transaction is never settled by the nodes and cannot be found on block explorer? In that case you might need to check if each fields are set properly. E.g. gas price, gas are above the threshold
undefined says yeah they cant get to the explorer, i was getting transaction underpriced error and doubled the gas and gas price
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Hey! running into the same error, is there a way to check the syncing status? how many hours does this normally take?
undefined says R u trying to do a fast sync from scratch or from one of the readily available archive backups?
undefined says Download the latest snapshot https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-2022-05-01.tar.gz and use this to bootstrap your node instead of trying to sync all the way from scratch
undefined says Ah sorry on baklava. is there a directory of all the snapchots for baklava too?
undefined says https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/baklava/chaindata-latest.tar.gz
It's for fullnodes/validators/proxies, no archive
undefined says Can someone help me debug an issue I am having? I am attempting to use hardhat to fork forno when running my test suite:

The reason I would like to test against a mainnet fork is because I am building a library for a project that interacts with already-deployed smart contracts not owned by myself. My goal is to be able to test the functions making actual local transactions.

`hardhat.config.js`
```ts
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  defaultNetwork: "celo-fork",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      accounts: {
        mnemonic,
      },
      chainId: chainIds.hardhat,
    },
    "celo-fork": {
      forking: {
        url: "https://forno.celo.org",
      },
      accounts: {
        count: 10,
        mnemonic,
        path: "m/44'/52752'/0'/0"
      },
      chainId: 42220,
      url: "https://forno.celo.org"
    }
...
};
```

undefined says can someone pinpoint me to where `onlyVM` functions are called/triggered from?
e.g. this function https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/Validators.sol#L487
undefined says nevermind I found it, https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/5db2af7e1a64e41cc2a7f3c53780c2ec3f04d203/consensus/istanbul/backend/pos.go#L201
undefined says Wrote a small script to query epoch reward params on mainnet:
```javascript
    const {newEpochRewards} = require("@celo/contractkit/lib/generated/EpochRewards");
    let epochRewardsContract = newEpochRewards(
      new Web3("https://forno.celo.org"), 
      "0x563BA8Ed56bd32a964831aB6AfF1E53238177eDA")

    let target, max, af = await epochRewardsContract.methods.getTargetVotingYieldParameters().call();
    console.log("target: ", target);
    console.log("max: ", max);
    console.log("adjustment factor: ", af);

    let cf = await epochRewardsContract.methods.getCarbonOffsettingFraction().call();
    console.log("carbon offsetting fraction: ", cf);
```

Output doesn't seem right:
```shell

target:  undefined
max:  undefined
adjustment factor:  Result { '0': '0', '1': '0', '2': '0' }
carbon offsetting fraction:  0
```

Am I missing something here? For context, I'm trying to better understand how on-target rewards are calculated
undefined says U mean to say you ONLY make 10k a week trading crypto?
That’s some pretty weak performance, I’m pulling that daily 😉
undefined says I also had the same problem that I cant deploy with ethers directly, so I used the celo-ethers-wrapper, but the contract addresses are wrong and I tried to get them the normal way via contract address + nonce, but they are also wrong. How are the contract addresses in Celo calculated?

https://github.com/climate-guardians/ClimateGuardiansDAO/blob/main/scripts/deploy.js
undefined says you probably plugged in the implementation address and not the proxy contract address, grab the Celo CLI, and there's a contracts command that prints the mainnet official proxy contract addresses
undefined says Hi everyone, I'm trying to send CELO using web3 and ethereumjs, and got confused how to correctly estimate gasPrice and gasLimit. Does anyone know how to correctly set these values? Thanks in advance!
undefined says Leave them empty and when u submit the tx, web3 fills it in for you
undefined says How can I generate random numbers on Celo? Chainlink VRF or in general Chainlink Oracles are not available on celo yet, right? Is there an estimated timeframe when that would happen?
undefined says Use the baked in random
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/start/randomness
undefined says U don’t need VRF or chain link, random is already onchain as core contract
undefined says But this is pseudo randomness and can be manipulated when blocks are reorganized or not?
undefined says Read the doc https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity/randomness

There’s no block reorg in Celo
undefined says So there are no reorgs, but validators can predict and introduce slight bias if sufficiently motivated. Adding a waiting period of a few blocks, where the app commits to using a randomness value N blocks before it is produced, addresses this issue. As an example, the attestation service [1]  uses a 4 block waiting period (i.e. N=4). Using a higher value gives you a higher degree of protection at the cost of a higher waiting time. Based on my analysis 3-6 blocks is a good range to choose from.

undefined says GM, I have a q for the celo explorer team:

I deployed an upgradeable ERC20 token. The Celo Explorer automatically noticed it was an ERC20 token and indexed it under its name and symbol. Now, if I upgrade the token later on with a different name/symbol, would the Celo Explorer update the indexed name/symbol, or would this require some action from the team? If the latter is the case, what would be the procedure for that?

Thanks 🙂
undefined says thank you a lot 🙂
undefined says In general I don't think it is an expected case that the name and symbol would change after initial deployment. So Blockscout _may_ detect the change, or it may not. You might try it out, perhaps on Alfajores, and find out.
undefined says Hi, I have another question. I was following this guide for a Governor Contract which also needs a TimeLockController and a Governance Token contract.

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#create_a_proposal

I wrote a script to create a proposal here:

https://github.com/climate-guardians/ClimateGuardiansDAO/blob/main/scripts/createProposal.js

It wasnt working and always throwing me an UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT "can not estimate gas limit" error. Then I tried it on rinkeby. I deployed the contracts there and just changed the provider and wallet to ethers and not the celo specific one and it worked. Is there anything extra that I'm missing in my code specific for celo?
undefined says What exact call is failing? And have you tried setting the `gasLimit` field on the transactions manually? In general I am not an expert on these things. @joshc might be better able to help.
undefined says I read in the docs that Celo doesn't have a gasLimit Opcode and Header, so that probably can't be the issue
undefined says Hi everyone , 

How can I get **BaseFee** for the current block using go celo library. With go-ethereum, I could get it by just query the latest block and it will return BaseFee with it
I understand Celo uses Gas Price minimum after reading this: https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/transactions/gas-pricing#transaction-fee-recipients. But without querying the Oracle contract, Is there no other way to get it using the go-celo library?
undefined says Right, so the blocks do not have a gas limit field, and so neither is the opcode that accesses this, but transactions still have a `gasLimit` field. So if estimation is failing, one thing to try is to set that `gasLimit` field on the transaction manually.
undefined says Is github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain, the `go-celo` library you are referring to? If so, the way to get the gas price minimum (i.e. the base fee), is to query the `GasPriceMinimum` core contract. A wrapper function is available in the `contracts` package [1]. In general, Celo's base fee / gas price minimum is implemented as part of the core smart contracts, so the information about the current parameters is available in the contract, but not in the block itself.

undefined says Thank you for your response @victorgraf . This should be it
undefined says Is there a way to show my nfts von the Alfajores testnet like on opensea on the rinkeby testnet?
undefined says I don't have an idea but this can help
https://docs.celo.org/developer-resources/walkthroughs/no-code-erc721
undefined says Hello i saw your message on the group that Is there a way to show my nfts von the Alfajores testnet like on opensea on the rinkeby testnet?  have you resolve the issue because i have also come across the same issue before
undefined says No, unfortunately not. I tested it on rinkeby first, just to be sure that it is working, because I also have a unity 3d model in the animation_url which was fine, but on Celo there is no way to show that now.
undefined says Hello, i tried to decode the transaction to verify event output in the testnet: https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/address/0xFCedf9CF9704678Ea1208478F63291f32fc8B239/verify-via-json/new

undefined says 
undefined says @Bayo   please any help here... I am trying to run a celo hosted node on gcp but i keep getting this error
undefined says 
undefined says hi! i'm getting an error "execution reverted" but nothing else, is there anyway I can get more info? it is in Alfojares, if it was reverted by me, using error messages for all the reverts I do, i should see them right?
undefined says https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/0x9f0706445626c586a9023774f0f65c0d2974831af8c0e029d4bd63bfe9e92866/internal-transactions
undefined says I'm not familiar with the process of using the machine images on GCP, but it looks you account on the CLI does not have the permissions it needs. (I am assuming that screenshot is from your CLI on your personal computer). Did you log in to your CLI? If you are using a service account locally, does it have the permissions you need?
undefined says @Valentin | cLabs is Blockscout supposed to decode the revert reason? (I don't have access to the source code, so it's also possible there simply is no revert reason supplied)
undefined says Yeah, it decodes the revert reason.
undefined says We have an open issue that in some cases it's incomplete https://github.com/celo-org/blockscout/issues/580
undefined says ok i will follow up the issue, thanks
undefined says i managed to detect what was the problem, but obviusly if we get more data it will help
undefined says i have a burning question is there any docs that i can use to integrate CELO to a mobile app in this case an iOS app
undefined says You can start from the link below

https://docs.celo.org/learn/celo-resources#developer-guide
undefined says @deleted-role how do I build a backend that listen for events on blockchain using Celo toolkits?
undefined says One of the devs will reply to you on this.
undefined says How can I get the exchange rate for cUSD to cREAL in a smart contract?
undefined says we are creating a dapp on celo and we have partnered with web3auth for wallet generation.We need a way so that we can connect the existing wallets with mobile numbers
undefined says hello guys !! can anyone help me with contract verification ?
trying to verify via hardhat - got an error
Error HH303: Unrecognized task sourcify

undefined says any ideas ?
undefined says Hello everybody,
I have problem:
When I try to call view function I get error(in attached), but send functions work correct
undefined says I had the same similar issue earlier today but it has been resolved now
undefined says How did you resolve it?
undefined says Shoot me a dm
undefined says UbeSwap provides one option https://app.ubeswap.org/#/swap. SushiSwap is also deployed on Celo and UniSwap will be soon. You could also use Mento to swap cUSD -> CELO -> cREAL
undefined says Unless the user gives you their phone number, you cannot discover the phone number for an on-chain address. This is an important privacy feature of the phone number identity system. https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity
undefined says Web3auth does not share private key with us
We do have the phone number and public address of the user’s wallet
undefined says this repo shows how you can register a phone number using javascript. it should help https://github.com/critesjosh/register-number
undefined says We are using this repo
undefined says @victorgraf
undefined says Indeed. Users will access to a phone number can verify it through the on-chain protocol to have their identity registered on-chain. (It sounds like I may not have understood your question before)
undefined says Yes I got it
But web3auth already generates a Celo wallet for the users 
We also accept the phone number separately 
We need to link the existing wallet to the mobile number,In the repo we need to export the private key.
Is there any other way?
undefined says Hey Folks. can anyone guide me how can I verify my smart contract on CELO chain, the one in their documentation (https://docs.celo.org/blog/hardhat-deploy-verify) is not working for me.
undefined says As long as you have a way to sign transactions, you should not need to export the private key. (E.g. if you look at the example, it only uses the private key to instantiate a local javascript wallet for the example. If you already have a wallet implementation, you do not need to do this)
undefined says Thanks a lot for the clarification!
undefined says So the wait is finally over.I have created a very dedicated repository for the one who learned and want to contribute in web3 .Contribute in my repo and enhance ur communication as well as contributing skill..
Thank's and regard

undefined says Ur contract has so many typos…. Use a spellcheck next time
undefined says Go to the sourcify website and verify it there, then go to celo block explorer and go to code tab and it will load
undefined says Ok sure..thank's for the feedback .
undefined says 
undefined says So i know that we're supposed to get UniV3 deployed on mainnet anytime soon, is there a source verified UniV3 on alfajores or even mainnet that I can start building peripheral contracts around? Otherwise, I'm gonna have to code all this stuff on Optimism testnet but I'd much rather just build right here on Celo mainnet instead.
undefined says Can I run rosetta with an existing node?
undefined says hey would yall know of any api i could use to get the qr code of a wallet address?
undefined says any QR code generator api would work, just feed it the address
undefined says Which wallet are you connected to
undefined says 
undefined says Have this code snippet that's not behaving as expected (both should be true/false). Right now it's returning `isEligible: true` and `inEligibleList: false`
```shell
    let vg = "0xeba452a3facad973d03daab5ca158c286c59a540";

    console.log(`validator group to check: ${vg}`);
    console.log(`isEligible: ${await election.methods.getGroupEligibility(vg).call()}`);

    let vgs = await election.methods.getEligibleValidatorGroups().call();
    console.log(`inEligibleList: ${vgs.includes(vg)}`);
```

Suspicion is that `getEligibleValidatorGroups` isn't returning the full list of eligible validator groups? Any reason why?
undefined says Thanks @RAinUsTa , but how to do it in hardhat ? because what if I have 10 smart contracts then I will have to verify each one by one on sourcify.
undefined says I never really got hardhat to work, so I just do it by hand
undefined says Is there any api or command that I can send celo to multiple addresses in one transaction?
undefined says Write you own bulk transfer contract
undefined says @RAinUsTa Is there any example or api docs about this subject? I don't see any related information about it. Thanks
undefined says let celotx = await celotoken.transfer(anAddress, amount).send({from: account.address})
undefined says This function can only send only one transfer
undefined says 
undefined says This is what I want. How can I implement it?
undefined says you need to write a custom smart contract
undefined says Also, that example you are pointing to, `0x62ff` that one isn't doing what you think its doing, it's a cyclic arbitrage contract
undefined says @RAinUsTa Thanks. Actually what I want is to save the fee for multiple transactions. We need to send celos to many addresses every day. We want to save the fee if bulk transfer is possile.
undefined says okay, then u can write a contract that take as input a LIST of addresses + amounts to send out, and receives sum(amount) from the caller.
Caller sends in sum(amount) along with recipient information, contract handles doing the transfers in a for-loop.

You won't save that much gas compared to just doing individual transfers.

A better design is actually to instead just shove sum(amount) into your contract, and inside that contract, keep a mapping of how much each recipient is allowed to claim (increment this over time).

When someone wants to get their rewards, they call claim and they're the ones paying for the gas to transfer.
undefined says if you are trying to disperse tiny amounts of celo continuously to lots of addresses, its very gas in-efficient, vs using a "rewarder" contract and just accumulating the rewards in there
undefined says force the recipients to pay for gas when they want to do a bulk claim of all of their accumulated rewards
undefined says Ok, I think it's better to use single transfer for me now. I'll try what u said later. We don't want our customers to pay the fee. Thank you very much!
undefined says R u running your TX with default 0.5gwei?
undefined says U can always run them at 0.1gwei
undefined says the metamask default recommended gas price is 5x higher than the bare minimal that validators accept
undefined says Let me try
undefined says I am running a rosetta docker. But I can't find the geth.ipc file or use the 8545 port
undefined says docker run --name rosetta --rm   -v "${DATADIR}:/data"   -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080  -p 127.0.0.1:8545:8545  -p 127.0.0.1:8546:8546  us.gcr.io/celo-testnet/rosetta:$RELEASE   run   --geth.network mainnet   --geth.syncmode full --geth.gcmode archive

undefined says and if you were using this script to check if the validator group was there, you should probably check the lowercase of answer
undefined says Good morning folks, i would have a quick question about Celo oracle data source. If i want to do dApp for Refi, what oracle data source i can use in Celo (that provide data related to climate change / natural resources) ?
undefined says I need to deploy a smart contract. But It’s failing to deploy on mainnet but works fine on alfajores
undefined says Send a dm
undefined says Hi @CryptoSardine you can find the latest mainnet backup here - https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-latest.tar.gz it contains the chaindata folder which should be placed at this path under your datadir `<datadir>/celo/chaindata`
undefined says I'm not aware of any oracles that provide that data on celo, I'm asking around to see if anyone else knows of anything.
undefined says Hey guys  
I’m having trouble using the DAppKit truffle box template 
Was hoping someone could help me out here

undefined says Hey guys. Do you recommend any services similar to Alchemy that support Celo? There's a link to Alchemy on Celo's website, but Celo is not listed on Alchemy, so apparently actually not supported.
undefined says Was having trouble testing a smart contract that interacts with `Election.sol` and it ended up being a problem with `UsingPrecompiles.sol`

Found this lovely PR by @boqdan | MentoLabs yesterday 🙏  that I was able to adopt and get working:
https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/pull/9666

Still not sure why this was needed though. For context, I'm running these tests using the `--fork-url` parameter. From what I understand, the precompiled values exist on shared, read-only contracts like `Election`, `Governance`, `EpochRewards`, etc. But not sure why this wouldn't be available automatically in a testing environment when I fork testnet/mainnet. Would appreciate any insights into this
undefined says When you’re forking what’s happening is that you still have Foundry node (forge) running the EVM but it delegates ‘getStorageAt’ calls to the node you’re forking from. Essentially meaning that the local node is still responsible for the EVM + precompiles but it acts on the data stored in the fork target node. Which means that precompiles still need to be implemented locally.
undefined says I see. So when I initiate transactions on Valora, for example, the local nodes holding these precompiled values would be the validators?
undefined says If so, how do precompiled values get loaded into those environments?
undefined says Precompiles aren’t values, they are pieces of logic which are either too complex/costly or impossible to execute purely in EVM, you can think of them as a sort of API you can call from solidity to code running outside of the EVM. 
The nodes implement that logic in general, so either validatiors or full nodes. But in the case of testing with foundry, the foundry node only implemented ethereum precompiles.
undefined says Gotcha. That's super helpful. Are there any docs or blog articles you'd recommend where I can learn more about this? Googled "precompiled contracts" and nothing I've found so far has explained it as clearly as you have.

undefined says Figment Datahub?
undefined says in Alfajores testnet can staking?
undefined says Hi, can I get information about nodes for example the fees they captured, the users that staked on them, it's balance etc. from a public rpc endpoint or could you point me to the right direction? Thank you 🙂
undefined says https://thecelo.com/
undefined says The fees charged for staking is very low.
undefined says I believe so
undefined says Cool, I'll look it up. Thanks!
undefined says hmm, how can I find validator
undefined says Scroll down
undefined says I'm sorry if my tune was rude, I'm not used to english 
But when I searched, I could only find baklava.
https://celo.org/validators/explore/baklava
It seems like I'm still a beginner. What should I do in this case?
undefined says Hey I'm just jumping in here and I apologize as I'm not fully up to speed, but my understanding is that Baklava is specifically a validator testing network and that may be why Alfajores is not shown on that list.
undefined says Hi there, did you check here https://celo.org/validators/explore
undefined says Correct. On the link I gave above, there is an option to choose either a list of Celo mainnet or Baklava validators.
undefined says yep I know, but I need Alfajores validator thx
undefined says Not sure about that. May be @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation can help.
undefined says or how can I find baklava testnet provider url I can fit
undefined says Not sure if these links can help https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet

https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/baklava-testnet/running-a-validator-in-baklava
undefined says do you know where I can find the commission? So, how many % a user has to pay when they want to stake on a node?
undefined says Hi, you mean APY percentage for staking CELO?
undefined says Hello, I'm getting this error:
`Error: Returned error: invalid argument 0: json: cannot unmarshal non-string into Go struct field TransactionArgs.chainId of type *hexutil.Big. continue... Error: Returned error: invalid argument 0: json: cannot unmarshal non-string into Go struct field TransactionArgs.chainId of type *hexutil.Big`
Does anybody know what is this error during sending transaction?
undefined says Hi. Where can I find information ℹ️ on how Celo network deals with Front-running?

My understanding is that it's built on Ethereum (so, prone to front-running) but handles transactions using another layer/method. How does it keep fees low & bypass the issues (eg. Front-running) on ETH?
undefined says 
undefined says Hi! Are you referring to insider trading or to front running bots?
undefined says No, I mean the percentage a node provider keeps when a user stakes. It must be somewhere set in the network settings I heard, but I cant find it
undefined says Can you please ask in #🏠︱validators-operators
undefined says Hey 🙂 Is there some sort of download for the full-node states for mainnet and alfajores for certain checkpoints? e.g. for eth mainnet you can download the chaindata of a synced fullnode somewhere to deploy and sync it faster. I'm aware that this comes with severe trust assumptions, just wondering if it's provided somewhere?
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/blog/developer-guide/start/hellocontracts
undefined says Thank you @biyiemmy, where specifically does this mention a download of the data-dir or so from a synced node? as far as I can see thats a basic tutorial. 🤔
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation can be of help
undefined says Hello guys, Happy to be on the server. I am a Full Stack developer who is keen to work on solidity/web3 projects.
Please let me know if your team needs new developers.
undefined says hey all, I was wondering if there is a timeline on when chainlink data feeds are going live on celo? I know there was an AMA some time back. Our protocol is dependent on chainlink feeds, and it would be a big dev effort (not to mention a re-audit) to port over to band or redstone. since chainlink is known to be coming to celo, that seems like the best path for us, but hard to say for sure without some sort of timeline.
undefined says We're waiting for the Chainlink team to do the integration on their end. I don't believe they clarified a specific date. We're working on getting a firm commit from them
undefined says ok, I have some contacts over there too, I will see if I can get some info
undefined says Thanks
undefined says I recently spoke to one of the BD and development team members at Chainlink Labs, regarding Chainlink deployment on Celo, as we require to use their Oracles, and VRFs as well in our project as well. They said the deployment processes are carried out as per demand. However, they did not mention any specific timeline, for this year.
undefined says There's also DSRV labs. Check it out: https://www.allthatnode.com/celo.dsrv
undefined says @aaron | cLabs | pretty clueless @Dev Rel 
Is there any way to implement gasless transactions on the CELO block chain.
undefined says I don't think there's one yet
undefined says Ok, thanks 👊 
How can someone launch a stablecoin on the CELO blockchain (asking for a friend)?
undefined says @biyiemmy
undefined says 😆 I meant, how does the Celo network handle it's transaction queue & gas fees?

Maybe you can point me to the correct section/documentation?

Sorry, I haven't delved toooo deep into all the tech details - will need a specialized technologist for it.

But my intention is to build a project on Celo. 🙏
undefined says I remember reading somewhere that Mento stablecoins need to be proposed to the Celo folks/HQ but we can also code our own stablecoins onto the platform. It's on Google/Celo website somewhere!

Maybe ask your friend to search 🔍😊
undefined says You've to start by creating a proposal for it.
undefined says article coming up pretty soon
undefined says Super awesome
undefined says Hy, Can someone tell how to get Celo testnet rpc endpoint. I want to test a smart contract using node.js on Celo testnet. How I can get the rpc ?
undefined says I see quicknode has for mainnet. But I want to test it first.
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/wallets/using-metamask-with-celo/manual-setup
undefined says https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org
undefined says This is for metamask. I need for backend node.js which can interact with smart contract.
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/forno#what-is-forno
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says 
undefined says Oh okay. I actually don't know, but I'll try to find out for you and get back to you. I'm very glad you're going to build a project on Celo. Very happy to have you!
undefined says I tried them but they are not working

undefined says Hello. I sent this tx https://celoscan.io/tx/0xb6e73b657d20af99f4fa44accc4da617132867c1b9531e44ae2e25070f21ded3 
But instead of CELO, wei is transfered. Why?
undefined says It seems the amt you sent is very low
undefined says It can be seen from the tx. It is 0.000000000000000015
undefined says wei is a unit not a token
undefined says I know, But why for other tx in explorer we see , CELO but just for this tx It is wei? For example check sender address tx's, all is CELO.
undefined says What is CELO chainId?
undefined says https://explorer.celo.org/tx/0xb6e73b657d20af99f4fa44accc4da617132867c1b9531e44ae2e25070f21ded3/token-transfers
undefined says 42220
undefined says Thanks
undefined says @biyiemmy  Today I'm facing with this error in CELO, I did test my tx transfer codes and as you see it works and I did transfer that tx, do you know what is this error as well? 
`Served eth_estimateGas

undefined says As you see in this address (it is my test address), all txs that I've sent before have CELO unit but just the last tx has wei unit. https://celoscan.io/address/0x19fd2467fa481ee1378e656bb0fe82e422d16add
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says try hex equivalent of 42220
undefined says ChainId can not be string. I'm using below code for signing tx, when change chainID to hex, it would be string, and bellow function didn't accept chainId as a string. It should be number.
`const signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(txData);`
undefined says Maybe you can give me another way for estimating gas for CUSD?

undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says `ContractKit` question: If I use `const kit = newKitFromWeb3(new Web3(provider));` and `var subscription = kit.connection.web3.eth.subscribe('pendingTransactions'`  I receive twice every transaction in `subscription.on("data"`
undefined says I see each transaction only once as it should be if I don't use `newKitFromWeb3`
undefined says what's going on there?
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says Is there a better channel to ask Contractkit questions ? I can also open an issue on GitHub
undefined says Open issue yes
undefined says done, is it clearer here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/issues/9765#issue-1342779695
undefined says @RAinUsTa I'm  using the same full-node parameters as yours except I have `max_peers` at 200 `memory` at 2.5G and `cache` 512
Sometimes, every 20 transactions maybe, my transaction is very slow to confirm, about 60 sec, while I can see it is confirmed on celo explorer. Do you experience the same otherwise what could be the reason? Can't be having more cache and peers than you have, I am going to restart with 5G of memory to see if it improves.
undefined says How are you measuring confirm time? Because as soon as the tx is broadcasted to mempool, it will be confirmed in the next block unless your gas price is too low or network truly is congested which should be rare
undefined says The transaction is confirmed in the next block on celo explorer but my local full-node does not seem to be aware: I am not getting the receipt in js, I eventually get it but it can take 1 to 2 min or I get an error message saying my tx hasn't been mined after 50 blocks. It does not happen often but quite regularly every 20 or 30 tx.
undefined says Then this means it’s not a problem with your node broadcasting tx, are you using websocket with your client program?
undefined says I use IPC
undefined says mmmm, i use websocket and haven't had this issue
undefined says can u do a A/B test and see if using websocket fixes it
undefined says ok will do, do you think it could also come from `max_peers` at 200  being too low  ?
undefined says hi, where can I check how many blocks are validated per year?
undefined says Answered in #🏠︱validators-operators
undefined says What is version of ContractKit that you are using?
undefined says @celo/contractkit@2.1.0
undefined says Hey, there.
I am going back to an app that I build months back.
I wanted to know what all changes I need to do ?
These are the versions I am using
```js

undefined says If you're learning to build on Celo, I came across a really cool course by LearnWeb3DAO: https://learnweb3.io/courses
undefined says Hello anyone knows why I'm getting this values for gas when try to send some $Celo from Metamask to another wallet?
Some users are getting same error
undefined says How much are you sending? It seems you're trying to send  0 CELO.
undefined says Fixed now.
undefined says Since I have restarted the node with 5G instead of 2.5G I haven't experienced this problem of very long response, at least yet and I'm still using IPC.
Not 100% sure the lower memory was the cause or that just restarting the node fixed another problem. Thanks for you help I could eliminate other potential causes like the max peers.
undefined says I still have issues with Metamask sending Celo. It sets the gwei fee to 0 by default. It started doing that a few days ago. It's weird.
undefined says this is my celo full node, been up for 2 days straight, and no memory problem, but u can see it wants 5G

undefined says Hello, how can I get cUSD for alfajores testnet? this website only sends CELO tokens (https://celo.org/developers/faucet)
undefined says It send CELO, cUSD, cEUR & cREAL
undefined says Make sure you add their CA to your account
undefined says could you clarify what CA is?
undefined says Contract Address
undefined says well, I was requesting tokens for my testnet wallet and can only see CELO tokens there, however I had few cUSD yesterday and now it just disappeared
undefined says Like I said above whenever you request for testnet tokens, CELO and CELO stable coins will be sent to the address
undefined says Add Funds
Enter the address of your Alfajores Testnet account to receive additional funds. Each request adds 1 CELO and 1 of each core stable token (e.g. cUSD, cEUR, cREAL). In the Celo Wallet, you can find your address by pressing the menu icon at the top left and scrolling down to bottom. Press the address to copy it to your device’s clipboard.
undefined says Try requesting for another testnet tokens @brudnevskij
undefined says 
undefined says 
undefined says @biyiemmy
undefined says You haven't added cUSD to your address?
That's why it isn't showing
undefined says Use the CA of cUSD through ""add tokens"
undefined says I already tried to do this
undefined says cUSD addr: 0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1
undefined says Kindly, reshare me the screenshot of your wallet
undefined says 0x874069fa1eb16d44d622f2e0ca25eea172369bc1
undefined says 
undefined says @biyiemmy
undefined says It is not showing cUSD account
undefined says I can stream you my browser if you wish
undefined says I dunno what to say cos it should be showing cUSD ehne you added it
undefined says Try restarting the app
undefined says Well, only reinstallation of plugin helped, thanks
undefined says Awesome 😊
undefined says Keep hacking...

undefined says Hello, I would like to ask, how can set a transaction value in celo plugin in remix ide
undefined says It’s not possible.
undefined says I have got such problem
undefined says 
undefined says oops
undefined says Hello, I have question about sending cUSD or even CELO. I made test contract to play with it.


It is just sending amount of cUSD to specific address, I tried to send it to another wallet.
After deploying this extension with celo plugin in remix IDE, I called transfer function and passed wallet address and amount: 1. At first celo wallet extension didnt want to put gas price by itself and after I am puting price by myself wallet extension tells me that there is exception in contract. Anyways after signing transaction I receive a green response in remix IDE, but my celo wallet tells me that transaction has failed. Better yet after transaction failure cUSD balance disappears from my wallet and can be seen again only after re installation of celo wallet extension.
I am very sorry for such a "long read", but I am stuck with it for 2 days already and dunno what to do.
undefined says Try and use the Remix transaction tab
undefined says 
undefined says 😦
undefined says Did you add cUSD to your wallet?
What wallet are you using?
undefined says I am using celo extension wallet
undefined says And I have cUSD and CELO there
undefined says @iamoracle | Celo
undefined says Can you send a screenshot?
undefined says @brudnevskij try this and you should be able to do it
undefined says https://github.com/lopeselio/celo-transactions-lesson/blob/master/webpage/index.js
undefined says Here is code, just some dummy contract to play around transactions. I also tried to use metamask(injected web3), deployment was ok, but transaction did not work
undefined says This repo teaches, how to do transactions with js in dapp for example, but I want to test functions of my smartcontract made in solidity
undefined says Did you get approval using the IERC20.approve method?
undefined says Not, really familiar with IERC.approval
undefined says ?
undefined says Before smart contracts can spend your funds, they will need approval.
undefined says You will need to call the approve function first.
undefined says Do you need a tutorial on how to do that?
undefined says I have some resources I could share with you.
undefined says Yeah, that would be great!
undefined says https://dacade.org/communities/celo/courses/celo-development-101

undefined says I was doing celo 101 and god stuck testing my smartcontract in remix, anyways thx a lot!
undefined says First, go through the stack overflow. After that, read about the functions in ERC20.
undefined says But if i'm getting asked by wallet on web browser, isn't it an approval already?
undefined says You can private message me
undefined says I can show you in a video call.

undefined says Hi, I have this smart contract that is working fine on Remix calling the transferFrom from a standard token implementation, but I get a "transfer value exceeded balance of sender" when executing on Alfajores and calling cUSD (0x0e53e30b81140edeb2993297dfcdb3e8c6c621d0).
Is there a way I can get more insights on what's happening inside Celo's contracts than what I can get on blockscout? In particular, I'd like to know what is the sender address that is checked, since the from address passed in argument of transferFrom should have enough funds.
Here is an example of a failing transaction: https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/0xc826870f1babf616618f1060548049b909985e5b7fa90b4cea08485fb142865a/internal-transactions
undefined says Maybe there is not enough testnet CELO in the address
undefined says Also, https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/783326878806048819/864149642614669322
undefined says Thanks for the input. Test account has normally enough funds and testnet CELO https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/address/0x0037112A5f7F413ac670b9d7FEaf92465E8e63cc/transactions
undefined says We are not using contractkit but bare bone web3.js ( 1.3.5) to make the initial call to our contract. Our contract then calls transferFrom of the cUSD contract  (0x0e53e30b81140edeb2993297dfcdb3e8c6c621d0). Actually, I was wondering if there was a tool to inspect execution beyond what blockscout is providing. Thx
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says Are you using the correct cUSD address on alfajores testnet ? 

https://docs.celo.org/token-addresses
undefined says Right, I mixed the cUSD contract address in my comments above with the address of our smart contract. But the smart contract is instantiating correctly an OpenZeppelin IERC20 interface with the address 0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1 and this is this address that is effectively called as shown in the Raw Trace https://alfajores-blockscout.celo-testnet.org/tx/0xc826870f1babf616618f1060548049b909985e5b7fa90b4cea08485fb142865a/raw-trace - the trace shows that there is a series of calls through Celo's smart contracts and then it apparently reverts within the StableCoin.sol transferFrom function. My problem is that I can not really see what is the from address that is checked for the 2nd require of:
`{
    uint256 units = _valueToUnits(inflationState.factor, value);
    require(to != address(0), "transfer attempted to reserved address 0x0");
    require(units <= balances[from], "transfer value exceeded balance of sender");
    require(
      value <= allowed[from][msg.sender],
      "transfer value exceeded sender's allowance for recipient"
    );
}`
undefined says OK, I finally found the source of the problem in our build process that led to an older version of our smart contract being deployed and calling transfer instead of transferFrom on Celo's stable coin contract. As a post mortem, the RawTrace was very useful pinpointing the issue, but I had to decode the trace manually to find that the wrong method was called  because there was too few parameters passed. It would probably be quite useful to have some sort of automatic decoding if that's possible. Thx to @biyiemmy and @ELIO | IntoTheVerse for their help.

undefined says Hi 🙂 try to look this and tell me if it's helpful https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/send-celo-and-cusd
undefined says thanks, but i want to write a smart contract that can hold cusd and also send cusd.
undefined says I see 🙄 then better ping @ELIO | IntoTheVerse & @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation they are the smart contract expert

undefined says @ELIO | IntoTheVerse thanks, i already have a contract that can send and recieve eth, but now i want one that sends and receives cusd (cusd is an erc20 token right?)
undefined says right
undefined says Yes
undefined says Just refer to this tutorial and find the way to import cUSD address like it is done here
undefined says This also uses a simple erc20 token abi. Only the address of cUSD is used to transfer cUSD from wallet to wallet using the functions in the erc20 contract
undefined says You can do it within the smart contract like this for example using IERC20
Token refers to token address of cUSD

function transferERC20(IERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw funds"); 
        uint256 erc20balance = token.balanceOf(address(this));

        token.transfer(to, amount);
        emit TransferSent(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
`
undefined says hey guys
undefined says is there any docs on how to choose cUSD for gas fees on js?
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says and using the contract kit, how can i sign a transaction using a private key?
undefined says nvm found it
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/blog/developer-guide/start/using-js-keystores#using-the-keystorewalletwrapper
undefined says Okay
undefined says hey guys I can't send a transaction on custom smart contract with contract kit
undefined says Error: unknown account
undefined says I've added the account and private key as shows here https://openbase.com/js/@celo/contractkit/documentation
undefined says isn't working tho
undefined says nothing?
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says Also, we will having developer office hours tomorrow 2PM WAT
undefined says Kindly, come around
undefined says what are those ?
undefined says those are a voice rooms where people can talk about development. Check them in the events tab in the top pf the channel list 🔝
undefined says yepyep i'll check it out
undefined says Hello, is the Celo team working on making Celo ready for a multi-chain world technically?
undefined says Hey @celestino127 can you please be more specific?
undefined says is there any documentation on how to send transactions on custom smart contract and selecting currencyFee (using private key)?
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer/contractkit/usage
undefined says people do you even read my messages?
undefined says literally wrote about getting an error using this library
undefined says how are we suppose to buidl on celo if support is not being provided when we get errors using your libraries guys
undefined says Hi Arch, I understand you are frustrated and I apologize that you feel like we are not reading your messages. Are you able to attend our next developer office hours on Tuesday, November 1 at 6 AM Pacific? That would be a great place to be able to walk through the error you're getting with other developers. I know they have helped me with problems I've encountered before.
undefined says sure, be there
undefined says @Basti | ARCH that error happens when you try to sign something with the node, and the node does not have that account.
The contractKit basically acts as an interceptor that checks if it knows how to sign a request, otherwise it forwards the request to the node, which, could know how to sign it (you could be running your own node, and unlocking the account which will be able to sign the tx)
In your case, as far as I understand, you are trying to use it locally. So, there are two options
1) you didn't set the privateKey properly
2) the `from` that you are using in the tx you are sending, is not the address that you stored in the wallet
undefined says im using the public rpc
undefined says For 1) if you create from scratch the kit, it will have the LocalWallet set as default (the one you'll need for the privateKey)
undefined says I'm a little rusty in our contractKit, but something like this, should work
```
const kit = newKit("<url>")
kit.connection.wallet.addAccount("<yourPrivateKey>")
```
and then, if you plan to use that wallet as default, and avoid adding the same `from` every time, you can also do
```
kit.defaultAccount = "<your address>"
```
undefined says after that, everything invoked from the kit, will use that address as the `from` of the tx, that later will be intercepted, locally signed, and then forward the tx to the public node
undefined says Also, I'm seeing that you want to set the fee in a stable.
Or you can set the `feeCurrency` in the specific tx that you want to use. Or, same as the default account, you can set the currency as the default payment fee:
```
await kit.setFeeCurrency(CeloContract.StableToken)
```
undefined says Let me know if that worked for you
undefined says And also, as a tip, this channel is focused in the technical aspect of the nodes we are running. Probably you will have more users answering tool related questions on the #🏠general-core
undefined says ok, I'll try
undefined says thanks for your answer
undefined says I'ts what am currently using
undefined says the exact same code
undefined says Mmmm, and is still returning `unknown account`? Can you share your code? (mock the private things)
undefined says yes
undefined says sure
undefined says https://pastebin.com/P5pxX6i2.
undefined says I just need to set currency fee as cUSD address
undefined says if I can make it using web3 library could be even better
undefined says I can call functions using the kit
undefined says but sending transactions is not going through
undefined says You can use web3 without the kit for 99% of the cases, that 1% is paying fees in a different currency, haha, so in this case you'll need it. Web3 doesn't know how to handle our extra fields, that's why the contractkit acts as a wrapper, intercepts the request, signs the tx with our wallets that know how to handle that extra field, and the forwards it
undefined says Let me check your code
undefined says Ok, a few things:
1) the kit already has a web3 instance, so you can use that instead
2) Use the CK to know the address of our contracts, this way, instead of having a fixed address, if you switch between alfajores/baklava/mainnet, the same kit will give you the actual address without issues
3) the `landTokenContract` is probably using some other instance of web3 to create that contract instance. I bet that that's your issue.
As you are using an instance that don't have the logic to intercept the request, basically, you are adding a privateKey to the kit, but all the calls happen in a different instance

So, try something like this:

```
const kit = newKit("https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org");
kit.defaultAccount = process.env.DEV_ADDRESS;
kit.connection.addAccount(process.env.DEV_PRIVATE_KEY);

await kit.setFeeCurrency(CeloContract.StableToken) // this is an async one, so it should be added in an async func, for exmale, in the addNewInvestment. I'm just adding this here to point you the better way to set the currency, the 2) point

const web3 = kit.web3

const landTokenContract = createLandTokenContract(web3); // here, you should use this web3 instance to create the contract

(...)
```
undefined says You'll need to modify the `createLandTokenContract`
undefined says ok great
undefined says checking..
undefined says currently the createLandContract function is on a separate file and looks like this:

`const createLandTokenContract = () => {
  const contract = new kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(
    landTokenAbi,
    process.env.LAND_TOKEN_ADDRESS
  );

  return contract;
};`
undefined says where kit is:

`const { newKit } = require("@celo/contractkit/lib/mini-kit");
const kit = newKit("https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org");`
undefined says ok, use the kit there
```
const createLandTokenContract = (kit: ContractKit) => {
  const contract = kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(
    landTokenAbi,
    process.env.LAND_TOKEN_ADDRESS
  );

  return contract;
};
```
undefined says You need to use the same instance of the kit. Otherwise you are setting the address in A, and then using B that doesn't know anything about the wallet
undefined says I see
undefined says let me check
undefined says ok that worked
undefined says but now i have this hahaha
undefined says `Error: Gas estimation failed: Could not decode transaction failure reason or Error: invalid argument 0: json: cannot unmarshal non-string into Go struct field TransactionArgs.chainId of type *hexutil.Big`
undefined says wrong params on the function?
undefined says Mmmm, that's probably an issue with how is estimating the gas from the web3 tool. I'll raise that issue, but let me search a workaround
undefined says thanks man
undefined says Try this:
```
const addNewInvestment = async (investor, tokenId, amount, tokenPrice) => {
  console.log("info of investment: ", investor, tokenId, amount, tokenPrice);
 
  console.log("kit", kit);
  // console.log(process.env.DEV_ADDRESS, process.env.DEV_PRIVATE_KEY);
 
  const tx = await kit.connection.sendTransactionObject(landTokenContract.methods
    .newInvestment(investor, tokenId, amount, tokenPrice))
 
  const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();
 
  console.log(receipt);
  return receipt;
};
```
I wrapped your tx with the object that we are using. and also removed the `.send({ from: process.env.DEV_ADDRESS, currencyFee: cUSDAddress });` because it's using the fields as default, and that function invokes a send
undefined says check that out (maybe it could have some types issues, I'm writing everything here, haha)
undefined says great!
undefined says it worked 😄
undefined says thanks a lot man
undefined says No problem. Glad to hear that works!
undefined says I'm building a dApp on Celo that will likely be used by non web3 aware users.  The blockchain itself will be just underlaying the project for the benefits it brings but not 'sold' as a feature.  For this reason, I'd like to minimise the barriers in onboarding.  As we all know, a major barrier is having a wallet.  Essentially it means downloading and setting up two apps instead of one... which leads me to my question: Instead of diverting the user to sign-in with an external wallet could the dApp manage the keys?  the account could be used just for the dApps purpose and offer an export for seed phrase from settings. 🤔 I have not fully thought it though but raising it here to see if I'm missing something obvious.  Maybe this is common but I have not really seen it done.  Any thoughts or input would be appreciated.
undefined says I’m worried about the security implications of using such an approach.
undefined says Users might need to trust you with their keys. What if someone injected malicious code into your front end?
undefined says @@emotf  Of course you can. but you'll have to think on how to handle those keys. Security takes time and resources. The majority of the dapps assume that the user already have a way that will handle their keys, and "kick" the security to another app.
And remember that probably you won't cover the whole scenario of things that the user wants to consume, so eventually will need different dapps, that will leverage on the usage of a different wallet. So, you are kind of delaying the actual need of a wallet.
undefined says The code would be native iOS and Android so script injection is unlikely.
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs & @iamoracle | Celo yes, the security is obviously the first concern.  In this use case however, the address created would be merely for a user account (identity) and signing non-monetary transactions.  Then maybe later an incentive/reward token but it would not have significant value.
undefined says I agree, the goal is to purely to delay the need for a wallet and improve the onboarding UX.  Over time and through the apps usae the user may become more accustom and want to create a 'real' wallet account in say Volora and transfer tokens to it etc.
undefined says I'd rather not have to implement this.  It'd be far easer to just follow the normal usual flow and leave this complexity to a 3rd party wallet... but when the target audience may deterred, I'm just considering it so as not to lose those users.  Note too that this flow would be optional: users could tap the normal connect wallet action to open Valora.
undefined says This of course, is a product decision. From a technical point of view, you can do it. But you will actually be a wallet + the actual product that you want to do. And, from my experience, when you start a product, is better to focus on the actual problem you want to solve. I'm not saying that the adoption of wallets are not an issue, but it has a lot of technical knowledge that maybe, is not the key of your product. And, in this case, where the user is in charge of their keys, they need to trust that you are handling those keys as secure as you can. Otherwise, a bug, a hack, or something aiming to get the user keys from your dapp, will break your users trust in you. That's why I think the majority, kicks that problem to a second party.
Also, think the future of that decision too. If your app, starts to be really used and your users actually start to know more about the ecosystem and wants to use different other dapps. Are you going to act as a wallet and allow other dapps to connect with you? (which requires again, more time and resources from your end)
Again, your call, but doing that, will probably make you a wallet in the future, which maybe is far behind the product that you want to create
undefined says hey guys, is there a way to fetch the cUSD address from a smart contract=
undefined says Don't understand if this is your question, but the cUSD contract is this one:
https://explorer.celo.org/token/0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a/token-transfers
undefined says in case it changes, is there a contract holding the address of celo currencies?
undefined says cUSD contact is always the same
undefined says great
undefined says @Basti | ARCH The cUSD is a proxy Contract. Which means that if we change the implementation via governance, we are just changing where that proxy points, but every call, will be performed to the proxy (who holds the state).
So, yes, technically, the cUSD *shouldn't* change. But is possible also to change the Registry's address of the cUSD proxy. But that's kind of a catastrophic scenario, hahaha.
The Registry, is the one who stores the addresses of the proxies of the core contracts. I recommend you to use the Registry, and avoid fixing addresses to your code.
One advantage of it, is that there is a Registry in all of celo's networks (all of them in the address `0x000...00ce10` "celo", set from the genesis). So, it you dapps uses the registry to retrieve the cUSD proxy address, your dapp will work for every network (you will only need to change the url of the node of the network that you want). So it's kind of easier to switch between a staging environment to a production one, without dragging bugs.
undefined says The ContractKit, uses the Registry, for example
undefined says In Alfojores Testnet, the money received from Faucet is in which unit?
undefined says 994400500000000000
undefined says This is our wallet balance in Alfajores Testnet
undefined says Just use Web3auth
undefined says or use https://www.xade.finance
undefined says This seems like what I had in mind. Do you know if users can still sign transactions?  I.e. they still have an on chain address allocated right?
undefined says Yes
undefined says Ofc
undefined says Web3 auth is good
undefined says Wei.

undefined says Welcome!
undefined says hey where can we get faucet cusd in bulk?
undefined says Hi, can you please check https://celo.org/developers/faucet
undefined says hey we need it in bulk
undefined says we only get 1 cusd here
undefined says Not sure about that but I will research for you and get back to you.
undefined says Would you need for baklava or alfajores testnet?
undefined says Alfajores
undefined says How much would you need? I can try to get them
undefined says We have 100 people in private beta and need 5 cusd each
undefined says Could you explain me why a transaction paying higher gas would fall behind a transaction paying a lower gas in the same block? I have a few examples and can't see any explanation
undefined says The validators are still the ones proposing a block (order and which txs should be added). We are working in a different way to select txs, which would mitigate this issue, but until then, any validator can shuffle the txs. This could explain what you are seeing. Are the same proposers involved in the examples that you have?
undefined says The last one I have noticed is with `Figment Networks 3` let me see which was the previous validator
undefined says Previous example I have was with `Simply Staking`
undefined says Can you send me the blockNumbers?
undefined says sure can you accept my DM?
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs Could someone please update the celo-blockchain instructions for building linux/arm64/v8 images? The Dockerfile.arm64 seems really out of date and doesn't build. Or could cLabs `buildx` and store them together in the container registry?
undefined says cc @Monica | cLabs
undefined says Are people falling on this scam? This one and the one "from Vitalik" are the "Prince of Nigeria" of our generation... @deleted-role
undefined says Thank you, @Ponti | cLabs. The message has been removed.
undefined says @Monica | cLabs  Theoretically, since the `golang:1.17-alpine` builder and `alpine:latest` both have `linux/arm64` image manifests on Dockerhub, the following should work:
`docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t geth:1.6.0 -f Dockerfile .`

However it fails at the `make geth-musl` step of the image build. Are there missing dependencies that need to be added first? I _can_ get it to build by swapping out the `golang` builder with `ubuntu:jammy` and installing go myself manually like this:
 ```
FROM arm64v8/ubuntu:jammy as builder

RUN apt update && apt install gcc make musl-dev wget -y

RUN wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.2.linux-arm64.tar.gz
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.19.2.linux-arm64.tar.gz
ENV PATH $PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

ADD . /go-ethereum
RUN cd /go-ethereum && make geth-musl
```
So I know it should build, with the right platform manifests available. Could cLabs provide "official" versions for different architectures?
undefined says Hey @jcortejoso | cLabs can you pls check dm

undefined says I see there are some comment on the README in the cli packages about issues on Linux telling you to rebuild the package from source. I don't get it - why would a npm package be deployed that requires you to simply go back to git and build it yourself. It shouldn't be a tagged release if it doesn't work without manual intervention. Is there something I'm missing or some new dependency my environment is missing?
undefined says @Thylacine | VladiatorLabs.io

undefined says Hi everyone, quick question here.  Do we have a resource to see the number and geographical location of all full nodes on the Celo mainnet currently?
undefined says Good morning Umarseby,
undefined says I don't think so but you can see the list of validators. here. https://celo.org/validators/explore
undefined says There is a site https://thecelo.com where a team built a map probably based on reverse IP location search of connected validators, but not sure that exists for full nodes. Maybe you would have to create a full node of your own and iterate the peers you are connected to?
undefined says hey guys
undefined says is there an api or tool to fetch the celo price in usd?
undefined says I guess you can always use cmc or coingecko api
undefined says we are a team of devs experienced in web3. If you require any  technical inputs and support for their grant application, We are happy to help
undefined says Do you need to fetch data on-chain ?
undefined says Welcome to CELO 👋
undefined says Welcome 🙂
undefined says the previously mentioned are good suggestions I've also seen https://api.docs.redstone.finance/ used to query Celo price
undefined says mmm probably off-chain would be quicker but can get limited, so any suggestion would be fine, if on chain i guess should bother in instantiate a router from some dex and estimate the output in a cusd-celo swap

undefined says @here Has anyone gone through this tutorial on Uniswap using alfajores yet (https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/guides/swaps/single-swaps) ? 
Having trouble getting it to work. DM me if you've got any insights 🙂
undefined says what is the issue you're facing
undefined says I’m trying to deploy that uniswap example with SwapRouter contract deployed to Alfajores. I can get it to work on ethereum testnet Goerli, but not on Celo-Alfajores
undefined says If possible can you please be more detailed as to what is happening when it doesn't work?
undefined says I'm trying to follow this example: https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/guides/swaps/single-swaps

I can get it to work on other testnets but not on Celo-alfajores or Celo-mainnet. When I try to call the "swapExactInputSingle" the transaction reverts with little to no info on why. The Uniswap contracts deployed are here (https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/reference/deployments)
undefined says Are you using Celo Extension Wallet or Metamask?
undefined says Metamask & Remix
undefined says Okay thank you. I'm looking into it.
undefined says Awesome! lemme know if I can help in any way. I already reached out on the Uniswap discord too
undefined says Okay I will thank you.
undefined says Idk if it matters but are you using a javascript or typescript project
undefined says I'm just using remix actually for testing.
undefined says Talking to the deployed test contract directly
undefined says oh ok
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation is this something you can help with?
undefined says I haven't done the tutorial so I'm just trying to follow along to help, so I'm escalating to somebody else at the same time
undefined says BTW, In the example it uses DAI and WETH9, which I replaced with cUSD and cEUR.
undefined says Have you used the correct addresses of cUSD and cEUR on alfajores?
undefined says Yep. Also approved the test contract to spend the input token (cusd in my case). I also tried to follow the guide on mainnet with the same results.
undefined says Give me some time, let me check it out too and get back to you by evening
undefined says Awesome! Thank you 🙏
undefined says @bridger You should also try to use https://github.com/Ubeswap/swap-component
undefined says I’m just trying to implement a test contract that swaps with uniswap. No ui even just using remix
undefined says Alright cool!
undefined says Been back and forth with Uniswap devs to no avail. Someone suggested its got something to do with tx object structures differing from Ethereum (which isn't true since doughnut fork) or maybe something with gas. I think its some sort of incompatibility with the SwapRouter deployed on Celo and the ISwapRouter imported from the "@uniswap" package... which would be a pain to work around : / lemme know if you were able to successfully follow that guide! 🙏
undefined says Hey @ELIO | IntoTheVerse and @vissequ  I finally got it figured out with help from the Uniswap team. So the Uniswap `SwapRouter` deployed is the version 2 SwapRouter. The difference between the first and second version is a "deadline" timestamp field is no longer specified in V2. 

I got tripped up because the field is still specified in the package from the example (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/v3-periphery) and only V1 routers are listed here (https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/reference/deployments) EXCEPT for the Celo SwapRouter which IS the V2. Thats why the example works on all the other chains because it references all the V1 contracts and Celo ONLY has V2 contracts. 

Solution for now is to not use the `ISwapRouter.sol` in the periphery package and to import a local version of the `ISwapRouter02.sol` contract into your project. Hopefully this saves other folks time : )
undefined says Awesome
Keep buidl-ing
undefined says Awesome! Thank you for letting me know.

undefined says thanks bud, got the latest one
undefined says EIP-1559 was added during London Hardfork. So it should worl
undefined says Well. It was related to my metamask. Sucks!
undefined says The network supports EIP-1559 since the Espresso hardfork. The issue is that lots of tools think it doesn't, so they don't allow sending the tx. The reason for this is that they check if the header of the latest block contains a field 'baseFeePerGas', which Celo holds that information in a core contract.
undefined says Node version 1.7.0 mocks this value when asking for blocks via RPC, so it allows the same check to work.
undefined says Hey, if someone need to test stuff by forking Celo mainnet, and having native stable tokens and CELO ERC20 in place, here is a working draft that you can use: https://github.com/moolamarket/moola-fix
There is a modified version of ethereumjs-vm/evm and ganache that uses it.
I will be looking to make it work with hardhat as well.

undefined says Ok thank u so much
undefined says If I'm online when you do could I sit in on the call?
undefined says No problem
undefined says Let me know if you solved it!
undefined says Perhaps you should try specifying gas in your config file:
`
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    test: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    },
    alfajores: {
      provider: kit.connection.web3.currentProvider, // CeloProvider
      network_id: 44787,                   // latest Alfajores network id
      gas: 4000000,    // Gas limit used for deploys, truffle gas estimation doesn't work work so we have to hardcode it
    }
`
undefined says Im using vanilla js n i don't have a config file. Yeah i think it's something to do with gas. But i set from 47000 to 4700000 n all triggered the same error.
undefined says https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-transactions-lesson/blob/master/lesson.js I think what you are missing out on is contract kit https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-transactions-lesson/blob/master/lesson.js `kit` wrapper to access celo tokens.
undefined says Scam
undefined says Banned thanks 😊
undefined says I'm actually using vanilla JS, is there a contract kit library that i can easily add in <script> tag?
undefined says Hello.

undefined says Thanks, going to try this
undefined says https://twitter.com/ConsenSys/status/1594726328229666822 some great news for the celo devs
undefined says Hi all, I got seg faults today which crashed my validator. Using v1.7.0
undefined says looking into it
undefined says Is there documentation somewhere into the parameters for celo-fullnode ? I would like to see txpool and websocket parameters
undefined says The docker guide was just crashing btw. Making from scratch from ur github source instead
undefined says Nice sync speed though. 200 blocks per second. Fast network
undefined says @pastoh, kindly answer this question.
undefined says good question tbh, I usually just use the `--help` or look at the source directly. The commands should be the same as standard geth in those areas (txpool and rpc ws)
undefined says afaik we have no changes on the `txpool.*` command line arguments
undefined says Hi Everyone! I have a question regarding the AMI light image on AWS. EC2 installation went fine, is there any way to access it with SSH keys and have an output monitor? (like celocli)
undefined says also, is there a default user when the image is created? (like ec2-user)
undefined says @pastoh thanks
undefined says I've no idea 👀
undefined says Is there any documentation regarding these AMI images? or at least someone who knows who might have created them 😄
undefined says I'm not even sure if this node is already working or not, maybe the best option is to configure a local celocli adding the EC2 istance as host
undefined says a help on that would be so much appreciated 🙂
undefined says last week AWS had a disservice who brought down our primary and secondary full node.. it took almost a week for getting syncronized again 😄
undefined says Is there anyone from @clab that can help? @Ben|cLabs
undefined says I actually managed to get the info I needed from the console monitor of the ec2 instance: the default user for these AMI images is *ubuntu*. 

Unfortunately these images are probably not updated on the current version of docker, node won't start automatically. These are related tracebacks:

`2022-11-24T07:16:49.548395696Z flag provided but not defined: -rpc
2022-11-24T07:17:49.937178636Z stty: standard input: Not a tty
2022-11-24T07:17:50.966487734Z Incorrect Usage. flag provided but not defined: -rpc`

But thanks to this I was able to find the usage of parameter *--mode lightest* for setting up a light node version using docker on a custom container directly.
undefined says this brings me to ask another question regarding the usage of lightest nodes: which modules (like eth, txpool, filter) are supported compared to full node?
undefined says For the RPC port, does only TCP need to be enabled as an ingress rule? Or does it also need UDP?
undefined says RPC uses UDP with TCP as a fallback.
undefined says hey guys do you know any good mainnet node provider?
undefined says Check Ankr. No rate limiting and also has dedicated endpoints. 

https://www.ankr.com/rpc/celo/
undefined says ty ser
undefined says Welcome
undefined says What is the approximate full node state size for Alfajores and Mainnet?
undefined says For a full node you will need the following:

Memory: 8 GB RAM
CPU: Quad core 3GHz (64-bit)
Disk: 256 GB of SSD storage, plus a secondary HDD desirable
Network: At least 1 GB input/output Ethernet with a fiber Internet connection, ideally redundant connections and HA switches
undefined says So I restored an Alfajores snapshot and the state size is around ~23G. Not sure about Archive, I estimate it would take 8 hrs max to sync? Would be good to have archive snapshots too in the future.
undefined says A mainnet (non-archive) snapshot was roughly 70GB the last few weeks.
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs ping
undefined says Could you help me out with this method? https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/2e37ebe19fcc83a43b067f21cbacaf385156ab13/eth/api_backend.go
undefined says Ops... this one: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/2e37ebe19fcc83a43b067f21cbacaf385156ab13/eth/api_backend.go#L302
undefined says It is not available in the client (ethclient.Client) even though it's at Backend interface in ethapi
undefined says Do you know any workaround to get this value in Go?
undefined says Last night my node output a bunch of these logs and then my entire machine proceeded to die. Are these logs problematic? Or unrelated to my problem?
```

```
undefined says Is the celo EVM a custom job, or does it match one of the ethereum mainnet forks?
undefined says the reason why i am asking is that i would like to see how much work it is to get the eth-tester / py-evm combo in python to work with celo. or is there a dedicated python setup for this?
undefined says Yes. It is evm-based and most tools should be compatible with a little customization e.g. Changing chain ID, RPC, etc.
undefined says cool, are signatures the same?
undefined says Do you want to consume it as a rpc call, right? You can read the MinimumGasPrice contract
undefined says If you are not using the node, it means that someone is trying to use the keys on your node. Check if you set the "personal" module as something available for rpc usage
undefined says If you have a public node, I'd recommend you to remove that, and if you want to use it, if you attack your node using the .ipc of your node, you'll do it as an admin, which will allow you to have every module available
undefined says Yes, I did @Ponti | cLabs . I thought I would be calculated by the node itself but later on @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation and @iamoracle | Celo told me I should get it from the Smart Contract. BTW, do you have the contract address in Alfajores and mainnet by hand?
undefined says I would recommend you to use the Registry to retrieve it. It's the easiest way and in the case of upgrading the contract, your dapp/script will still work
undefined says Thanks @Ponti | cLabs . I will try to get it using https://github.com/celo-org/kliento 
Hopefully Kliento is updated with the latest addresses. If not I will let you guys know in here.
undefined says request forwarded in #🏠general-core
undefined says Are devs away for Christmas? These channels are less active.
undefined says Quite possibly
undefined says I would imagine many are traveling not sure though
undefined says Yeah. I have a whole lot of things to code 🥶
undefined says Happy to answer questions if someone wants to use some of these days for developing :celo:
undefined says Same here too. 💃
undefined says I’m doing a lot of lighting and decoration at home 🏡 😅
undefined says Happy New Year to all developers building on the CELO platform! We wish you success and great achievements in 2023! May this new year bring you more opportunities to develop groundbreaking projects and revolutionary solutions. Cheers to a prosperous 2023!
undefined says Let’s keep building. Cheers!
undefined says Running the celo full node, is it possible to move the /ancient files to another drive? what are the parameters to be provided?
undefined says could you please explain more ?
undefined says You can use the next cmdline flag:
```
  --datadir.ancient value             Data directory for ancient chain segments (default = inside chaindata)
```
undefined says thanks that's what I guessed but I don't know how to pass it to docker with the correct absolute or relative path
undefined says The reference in the cmdflag must be referenced to the container's fs namespace. 
But also considering that you are running in a container, you can use this to change the placement outside the container without the need of changing in geth's flag
undefined says Considering default datadir (inside the container) is `/root/.celo/`, for example you can use:
```
docker run -v /home/myuser/celodata:/root/.celo -v /home/myuser/celo_ancientdata:/root/.celo/celo/chaindata/ancient ...
```
And with that you should be customize the folder without the need of customizing the geth command
undefined says Or if want to customize at geth level too:
```
docker run -v /folder1:/folder1 -v /folder2:/folder2 ... geth --datadir /folder1 --datadir.ancient /folder2 ...
```
undefined says That's awesome, thanks for explaining, it's all clear now!
undefined says I will test it tomorrow and revert if any question
undefined says `docker run --name celo-fullnode -d --restart unless-stopped --stop-timeout 100 --memory 5G -p 30303:30303 -p 30303:30303/udp -v $PWD:/root/.celo -v $CELO_DATA_ANCIENT_DIR:/root/.celo.ancient $CELO_IMAGE --syncmode fast --txlookuplimit=800 --maxpeers 200 --etherbase $CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --datadir /root/.celo --datadir.ancient /root/.celo.ancient --cache 512`
undefined says Friends, do you know what is the best way to monitor the event of receiving a Celo native coin transaction in a blockchain wallet? Is there a websocket service? Or free tool developed by the community?
undefined says You can use https://celoscan.io to "Watch" addresses and be notified when there is a tx. Alternatively you may create a custom script monitoring the tx events and sending a notification when required. You may connect to a public ws provider (forno, quicknode, ankr, infura...)  or deploy your own node to subscribe to it
undefined says Thanks, friend. This was extremely helpful!
undefined says Hi all, does Alfajores support EIP1559? I am deploying via hardhat & infura and am getting the error ```method 'eth_feeHistory' not found```
undefined says Yes, Celo uses a gas market based on EIP-1559. You can read more about how it works here at https://docs.celo.org/protocol/transaction/gas-pricing.
undefined says Thanks @iamoracle | Celo . I saw that in the docs, which is why I was confused by that error response from infura when calling Alfajores. I thought perhaps there was some difference there.
undefined says However, Alfajores doesn't support EIP-1559.
undefined says I will inform the team about this problem, and I will get back to you @mackiemesser. We are so sorry for the inconvenience.
undefined says Great - thanks!
undefined says Not atm
undefined says Thanks for pointing !
undefined says Hey @iamoracle | Celo and @vissequ just to thank you guys again for the help you guys gave me in the beginning of the week. I've done a solution based on that and it's working amazingly great. 

If any dev got any doubt or issue while trying to request transaction data using celo/alfajores scan, feel free to mention me, I'll gladily help.

This week my work partner @EdRodrigues[Lovecrypto] surprised me with this Celo testnet that I didn't saw before: *Baklava*. For the sake of my curiosity, can someone point me the main differences between Alfajores and Baklava? Thanks in advance ☺️
undefined says Hi, Alfajores is a developer testnet while Baklava is a testnet for validators.
undefined says Thank you, @0xKnight 🤙
undefined says You are welcome!
If you want to learn more, check https://docs.celo.org
undefined says Hello everyone, I've successfully setup the alfajores testnet full node & synced as well. can someone please guide me on how to make RPC calls documentation? 
and also please help on how make websocket calls documentation?
undefined says Hi @soham.jadiya this page explains the rpc api - https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/ or alternatively you could use a library such as web3.js (https://github.com/web3/web3.js) or ethers.js (https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)
undefined says Got it, Thanks @Piersy
undefined says Thank you for the very kind words 🙂 let us know if you need anything else
undefined says Hey guys! If I asked this question, I'm not finding It anymore: I've tried to fetch some transactions using the token transactions endpoint (that one that fetch ERC20) and it returned some transactions that I have done using custom tokens which were something I didn't wanted. To return the transactions done with A-CELO I had to use the normal transactions endpoint. Everything work greatly but after I've finished my solution and one of my team members went to test it, he was only able to fetch CELO transactions using the "token transactions" request. With that said, can someone, please, teach me the difference in the use case of both requests? Isn't A-CELO an ERC20 token as well? Thanks in advance! Good weekend for us all 💜🤘🏻
undefined says https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts#get-a-list-of-normal-transactions-by-address
undefined says @Cisnei you should try this by creating an account on celoscan and using the api key.
undefined says https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/api-docs this should help out.

undefined says I'm seeing this error on a celo node deployment and am not sure what it is related to: ```Error invoking evm function: EVM call failure to=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ce10 method=getAddressFor input=0xdd927233235a6f54090e9b94aa4e585a699c4375a2ff8f572c68114d138f0ed121527849 maxgas=100,000 err="execution reverted"    message="No Implementation set"```
undefined says Is this related to the address not having any celo in it?
undefined says CC: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says What are you building today?
undefined says That's basically saying that you don't have the registry contract, which is deployed in the 0x0...0ce1o (celo). Are you trying to create a custom network, right?
undefined says Did you check `mycelo`? (the tool that we have in the repo to spin out new tesnets
undefined says No. I'll take a look. I just deployed a full node with the instructions in the doc.
undefined says Just wanting to deploy a full node that adds resources to the network and provides a public API. 

Just to confirm, rewards for running the full nodes has not been enabled yet, correct?
undefined says Yes. The instructor SSH’d into four different computers. They are the attestation, account, proxy, and validator nodes.
undefined says But those four different computers are GCP instances right?
undefined says Hi,
I am a fullstack blockchain developer and I have built several big Dex, NFT Marketplace, Staking, Lending, Launchpad projects before.
I am proficient with Solidity, Rust, Move for smart contracts development and have strong experience in React.
Also I have some experience in UI/UX such as figma.

Let me know if you are in need of developers.
Thanks a lot.
undefined says Hi, check https://celo.org/careers
undefined says Hi guys can we please fix the gas pricing on Alfajores? It’s running at 30gwei
undefined says I am sorry for the inconvenience. CLab is  working on it already.
undefined says I have been able to confirm that this is likely due to the recent gas proposal.
undefined says Yes, I think that @RAinUsTa is talking about reducing that on Alfajores. As a testnet and with low faucets, it probably better to keep those numbers lower, even if we are not going to be 100% the same as mainnet (I'll raise this)
undefined says I would go with the idea of having a bigger faucet and making the testnet gas be the same as the mainnet. This will help devs have a clearer picture of how their app will perform on mainnet.
undefined says @iamoracle | Celo Bigger faucets also mean more possible attack scenarios where someone could vote their own validators rotate the validator set and perform a 1/3 attack, or even stall the network. Alfajores started with a less amount of "printed" celo, and the majority of that celo is part of the reserveProxy (https://explorer.celo.org/alfajores/accounts), something that we should change in the future. Maybe mint, or even transfer that reserve to the "faucet arks".
But right now, the safest choice is to reduce the gasPriceFloor. Then we could define how we could sanitize Alfajores
undefined says I can't find recent backup of the chain in https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/ where is it available now?
undefined says latest one is 18/JAN/2023
undefined says I've also checked https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-latest.tar.gz but it is as of 27/JAN/23 it seems
undefined says Hi @kewl ! We switched those backups from `tar.gz` to `tar.lz4` format, because it was taking too long to compress but also decompress. Try with https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-latest.tar.lz4
undefined says `lz4` tool in needed now to decompress (available for all distros I checked), you can use `lz4 -dc chaindata.tar.lz4 | tar -xvf -`. It will be much faster
undefined says Good move, *lz4* is indeed a better choice for this kind of compression, I would have recommended *zstd* which is probably the best speed/compression ratio, it can go as fast as *lz4* with higher compression. Give it a try if you have a chance.
undefined says Cool thanks for the advice. I'll check
undefined says Does the snapshot file https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-latest.tar.lz4 not work for the archive node?
undefined says that is for a full node to use, it has historical state pruned, not applicable for an archive node.
if you need a historical archive node, then the best choices are:
1. sync ur own archive node, will require massive SSD and time
2. use one of the paid hosted service to access their archive node, more convenient
undefined says Thanks for the response.
undefined says hello guys, dose celo has official testnet snapshot for syncing?
undefined says You can use https://docs.axelar.dev/validator/external-chains/celo this
undefined says I think it's a tutorial about setting up new fullnode.
But I need chaindata to sync fullnode faster.
Do you have available chaindata snapshot for `alfajores` testnet?
undefined says You can use this link: https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/alfajores/chaindata-latest.tar.zst. To unpack you need to install `zstd` and run `tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xvf chaindata-latest.tar.zst`
undefined says Thanks for helping @jcortejoso | cLabs
undefined says Good to see there is a *zst* archive now :seedling:
undefined says The `--use-compress-program=unzstd` is for the ones who use ancient versions of tar, recent releases are compatible with zstandard without extra parameter.
undefined says Hi, my archive node is full synced, but for some of the blocks somewhere in middle `eth_getTransactionReceipt` return null response to all transactions of some block. Anyway to fix this?. Can I reindex all the receipts again?. Or just partially update the blocks?. This is a celo node running geth.
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation is this something you can assist with?
undefined says Did you bootstrap your node with a snapshot or sync from the start?
undefined says https://discord.com/channels/600834479145353243/783326878806048819/1073916474265178132 @zimbabao @Sohail | GrassrootsEconomics would this help?
undefined says Synced from the start.
undefined says That's not a archive node. I have synced an archive node.
undefined says Shouldn't be the case if you synced archive from the start. Maybe create an issue with the node config and specific block number.
undefined says Submitted the issue https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/2014
undefined says 👍  I suspect data corruption. Geth has always had these issues. Most providers just re-cache the states onto their own data stores and serve those.
undefined says Anyway to repair the the corruption?. Can I just rebuild the index?.
undefined says Now the node is failing with error ```ERROR[02-20|00:32:41.143] Ethereum peer removal failed             peer=d8793e7e err="peer not registered"

undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation , hey Harpal, could you please help?
undefined says @jcortejoso | cLabs is this something you can help with 😅 ?
undefined says Is the node syncing? Or is it failing at all?
The error is not problematic if it is failing. One peer connection timed out (that can be expected because different reasons), and then the `removePeer` function is called twice, and that is the reason of the `ERROR` trace.
undefined says it just stops to sync. it was syncing earlier.
undefined says Is it connected to any peer? (you can use `net.peerCount` on the geth console)
undefined says ```> admin.peers.length
7
```
undefined says and `eth.syncing`?
undefined says ```> eth.syncing
{
  currentBlock: 17805618,
  highestBlock: 17867101,
  knownStates: 0,
  pulledStates: 0,
  startingBlock: 17805619
}```
undefined says 👍 It is probably syncing. During the process it will show `0` as block, but whenever it finish it will show you on the latest block `17867101`
undefined says sadly, it is not. Been in same state for hours ..
undefined says Interesting. Is not any other message in the logs apart from the `dropping peer` and `removal failed`?
undefined says If it is a fullnode (not archive node), I can provide you the link with an updated chaindata if you want to use that instead
undefined says I have full nodes working correctly. This is an archive node. It was working correctly.
undefined says 🤔  Can you start the node in debug and send me the logs?
It may seem that the chaindata is corrupted and because of that is not syncing, but I'm not sure what can be happening.
undefined says Doing it now. I see same issue if I start one more archive node to sync from the genesis.
undefined says @jcortejoso | cLabs
undefined says ``````
undefined says So I do not see any trace there that seems suspicious to me. I'm going to ask clabs blockchain team is someone can suggest something. BTW are you using 1.7.2 version?
undefined says Yes. I am using `celo/v1.7.2-stable/linux-amd64/go1.17.13`
undefined says Node moved for sometime after i reset header by 100 blocks,
undefined says 🤞 Hope it did the trick. My guess is some data corruption that caused node to be stalled. Hope setting the head few blocks behind fixed the issue
undefined says Thanks @jcortejoso | cLabs . I think @zimbabao was facing this issue for quite some time now
undefined says Thanks, @jcortejoso | cLabs, for the help.
undefined says Thanks all. I had different issues, 1/ Missing recipts for some blocks (recreated by copying ancient files from a full node). 2/ Node got stuck (setting head back did the trick and node is syncing well for last 2 days).
undefined says Hello everyone! I'm seeking for recommendations. We're building a project in which we have a reserve of productive assets that serve as a collateral for a stable-coin. Those assets produce income over time, and we will implement a governance system in which our users will be able to decide how to allocate the reserve's income, which will acquire new assets to be included into this reserve.

Furthermore, we're thinking that this governance system should provide a list of the assets that *could* be funded, and that the governance goal is to decide what percentages of the accumulated income to allocate to different specific assets.

What technical considerations would you take into account building this feature?

Concerns we have:
 - We don't want to deploy a token 'just' for governance, but rather we want that the same stable-coin that is collateralized by the reserve can be used as governance token for this specific purpose. We think that using a governance token 'in parallel' would deviate the attention of our users to this token, and not the 'reserve' token which is the want we want to massify.
 - We don't want that, in order to vote, you have to stake your coins.

Thanks for any input you may have!
Greetings from 🇨🇴
undefined says Maybe this is not the right channel for this question, right? Just noticed that this one is for development of the Celo blockchain itself. What would be the proper place to ask this kind of questions?
undefined says @here
What does a hardware oracle for random number generator, powered hardware TRNG sound like? 😊
undefined says sounds good, do you have more info to read upon??
undefined says Hey, you can ask it on the ecosystems channel, or even discuss it during office hours and on #💬︱office-hours-chat
undefined says I'm cooking 
More information will be available later🤝🌱
undefined says @here can anyone help me on how to get some testnet tokens? https://faucet.celo.org/ seems to be out of CELO  😦
undefined says Please don't use the tag @ here
And you can try this one https://www.allthatnode.com/faucet/celo.dsrv
undefined says thks @Moderator | Celo (UTC-5)  Will try it!
undefined says Please don't tag. Just reply the message and is enough
undefined says lz4 snapshots are around a month old. Would be good to have new ones.
undefined says Hey have you tried this ? https://celo.snapshot.directory/
undefined says No, i;; try this next time. What about the alfajores snapshot?
undefined says Hi @Sohail | GrassrootsEconomics ! We may forget to mention that the new snapshots that we are using at cLabs are tar.zst format as recommended here. For alfajores you can use this link:
https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/alfajores/chaindata-latest.tar.zst. Hope we keep this format and name pattern (tar.zst), if there is not any further recommendation about it.

Also available for `alfajores` or `mainnet`
undefined says thanks @jcortejoso | cLabs
undefined says Hi all, just wanted to ask about the `extraData`  field in the genesis.json (https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/genesis_blocks/o/mainnet?generation=1595424802948104&alt=media) as we have a mismatch when auditing one of our addresses and I'm suspecting it is related to the genesis. 

What does it mean if this address is included in here without the '0x' part please?
undefined says I'm not sure, if I would be able to help here. cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation could you please look into this?
undefined says The extraData field for us is not an address, is an rlp encoding of the data of our consensus layer. More specifically for the genesis, we are setting the initial validator set, the ones that are going to reach consensus on the blocks of the first epoch.

undefined says cc: @jcortejoso | cLabs , can you please look into this?
undefined says Did you manually stoped the node after the error? That error is "expected" when syncing from genesis, as core contracts (particularly `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ce10` that is the registry contract) were not deployed as part of genesis block and it will show similar error while syncing some of the first blocks of the chain (related issue: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/2008)
undefined says This error can appear after a ungraceful shutdown. In my experience it can take order or tens of minutes to recover.
undefined says Helllo
undefined says Waht is the celo derivation Path?
undefined says m/44'/52752'/0'/0
undefined says Thanks
undefined says Does anyone know how I can run a Celo Node in snap mode?
undefined says https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-latest.tar.lz4 you mean snapshot?

```

Has anyone tested ethers v6 with CELO chain?
undefined says I think I need to override the block difficulty to make it compatible for ethers v6, I've checked the celo-ethers-wrapper but it's not up to date. Can someone work me on the v6 wrapper?
undefined says I am tagging @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation to look into this.
undefined says Thank you anyway.
undefined says Does anyone know any transaction automation tools on Celo?
undefined says like chainlink keepers? Not sure if redstone oracles have something similar
undefined says Yes. I am not sure either. I have been searching through their docs.
undefined says Does celo have lower gas limit than other chains?
undefined says I don't think so.
undefined says Hi, I would like to see how much network data is transferred for a validator per month.
undefined says Hi, openzepellin defender works for CELO too.

undefined says Thank you very much, @nuel. It worked ✅

@khadeeejah @gconnect, kindly check this out. It's available on Celo.
undefined says Awesome, happy to help🙏
undefined says Dump allows you to start a node quickly and it catches up with head.
undefined says [RESOLVED] debug_setHead some 100 blocks from current stuck state.

undefined says Hey guys do Celo validators know which blocks they will produce in advance? Like in Ethereum PoS where they seem to know what blocks of the next epoch they will produce
undefined says From one of our validators:

In the last block of every epoch, a new election is run for validators for the following epoch. The results of the election are written into the "epoch block"'s header.  Validators following the consensus protocol use this list and the on-chain randomness at that block to determine a permutation for which validator they expect to receive a new proposal from for each block. (In the case of a validator being down or otherwise failing to propose a block, the validators move along in that order).  So yes, in general, validators take it in turns and know the order in which they are likely to be producing a block.  But they cannot control it, and a malicious operator with a number of validators cannot arrange for their validators to appear consecutively (except by chance).
undefined says thank you. Do you know whether it's possible that a Validator produces 2 or more blocks in a row? and if yes with what chance or in what frequency
undefined says When querying for the balance of one of our addresses (0xc2023e0d13f53d181f29b99d829cd75628337d15) at block 0, it shows a balance of 353637147.869633674621582 cUSD here: https://explorer.celo.org/api?module=account&action=tokenbalance&contractaddress=0x765de816845861e75a25fca122bb6898b8b1282a&address=0xc2023e0d13f53d181f29b99d829cd75628337d15&block=0
where the contract address 0x765de816845861e75a25fca122bb6898b8b1282a represents cUSD.

However, there is no mention of this amount in the genesis.json file (https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/genesis_blocks/o/mainnet?generation=1595424802948104&alt=media).

Am I misinterpreting something please?
undefined says Clicking on the link, I got 12608.715955473397412423 cUSD.
undefined says My apologies, I meant to write 12608.715955473397412423 cUSD. Where did that balance come from please as it is not listed in genesis.json?
undefined says Any reply to this please? @iamoracle | Celo
undefined says do you mean this balance in the results key?
undefined says Yes...but I figured later that it seems there is no history being kept for cUSD.
undefined says Unless there is another endpoint which allows for that?
undefined says I'm aware there is also the following endpoint: https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/api?module=account&action=tokenbalance&contractaddress=0x765de816845861e75a25fca122bb6898b8b1282a&address=0xc2023e0d13f53d181f29b99d829cd75628337d15&tag=0, but they both give the same response i.e. the latest balance is returned and not that at height 0
undefined says Seems like I was right, but correct me if I'm wrong:
https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/api?module=logs&action=getLogs&fromBlock=0&toBlock=19071167&address=0x765de816845861e75a25fca122bb6898b8b1282a&topic0=0x000000000000000000000000c2023e0d13f53d181f29b99d829cd75628337d15
undefined says @jcortejoso | cLabs can you please help Tristan here?
undefined says @Tristan | Simply Staking Let me ask explorer team if there is an endpoint on explorer API to check that. Alternatively you can use ethereum-api rpc call for getting the balance cUSD at any heigh with `eth_call` using the contract function `balanceOf(address)` at any height, if you request the data to an archive node

Either way cUSD contract was not deployed at genesis block (it was deployed/initialized around block ~3000), so any result that is not error (or null) returned at height 0 can be considered wrong.
undefined says @Tristan | Simply Staking explorer team confirmed there is not a method on their api to get the balance of an erc20 token on a given block. I guess one alternative would be fetching the erc20 transactions as csv from explorer/celoscan, and build the balance with an script

undefined says Hi @JC,

We are currently deploying the CLI with only Node.js v12.x. If you are running a different version of Node.js, consider using NVM to manage your node versions. e.g., with: nvm install 12 && nvm use 12
undefined says Follow the instruction on this page. 

https://docs.celo.org/cli
undefined says Try setting up python 2 and python 3 even though some packages might be deprecated. 

Also make sure you are using node 12 or 14 as Abiola mentioned above
undefined says Also make sure you refresh or close your terminal once nvm version is modified for the changes to reflect
undefined says Hello guys.. Is there any way to pay transactions fee using CeloContract.StableTokenEUR or CeloContract.StableTokenBRL?

undefined says Thank you very much!
undefined says I've had this issue myself. Just curious why the maintainers are stuck to the older nodejs version. Dosent look good from a dev/sec perspective.
undefined says Hey guys does hardhat forking of Celo work? I am getting this error and I saw an issue about it on GH that doesn't look like there was a solution found:
```
Errors: Invalid value undefined supplied to : RpcBlockWithTransactions | null/sha3Uncles: HASH, Invalid value 0 supplied to : RpcBlockWithTransactions | null/difficulty: QUANTITY, Invalid value undefined supplied to : RpcBlockWithTransactions | null/uncles: HASH Array
TQT
```
undefined says You can't fork the Celo network with Hardhat.
undefined says require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" }); 

Can you try this ? 

You can try a quick node celo rpc 

const QUICKNODE_RPC_URL = process.env.QUICKNODE_RPC_URL;

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.10",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      forking: {
        url: QUICKNODE_RPC_URL,
      },
    },
  },
};
undefined says Even I’m not sure if it can be done with hardhat. But you could try it @CarsonCase
undefined says I have tried it in the past. It didn't work.
undefined says I see 😅
undefined says Anyone can help me with receiving more testnet tokens than from the faucet? We are working on a cross-chain payment solution and Celo is one of the next ones to be supported by us preferably.
undefined says Hi @Thinh, you can request large amounts of testnet tokens through this form. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpt3WikYt5-TsDHmUgfFCbZjmZMcWr9bO5H0csHcmMrl9sFw/viewform
undefined says How can I pull in the data found on the explorer of `epoch rewards` and `epoch transactions` from the Node through RPC calls?

Example for the data I am looking for: https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/block/19042560/epoch-transactions
undefined says https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/api-docs check API docs
undefined says So the data we get from the API can’t be extracted from an RPC call? Just double checking if this is even possible
undefined says i think blockchains like Solana allow RPC calls directly for epoch rewards. 

Anything outside these methods is not allowed on Celo https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/eth-rpc-api-docs
https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/api-docs

Please correct me @iamoracle | Celo . I might be wrong here.
undefined says Sorry for the late response; you are right. Except you are working with a custom node, you won't have access to anything outside the standard methods.
undefined says hello following this thread, if you have a node, how would be the process to obtain the epoch transactions?
undefined says Hello,
Does anyone know if https://celo.quickestnode.com is a legit RPC provider?
undefined says I dont know it
undefined says Hey! Is it possible to locally fork the Celo network to run integration tests for use cases that interact with protocols present on the Celo network. 

I've so far tried forking with both, Foundry & Hardhat, but to no effect.
undefined says Only connect with RPCs available on chainlist
undefined says Hey Manan. I’ve tried with hardhat as well. But got no results.
undefined says Cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation is there any alternative?
undefined says Hey @Lukas | Bitquery.io could you create a #🔖︱developer-forums with the tag 🏷️ help needed. Let’s try to solve it in an organised way.
undefined says thanks, I will do!
undefined says No you can’t fork yet, there is a discussion already in the hardhat repo you should add comments there
undefined says Hello!  we are having an issue with Celo nodes: at least some of the nodes are sending slightly different **hewHeads ** notifications about the same block. some part of **extraData  ** is different. All nodes run with the same configuration and updated to the latest version. Please tell me if this behavior is normal. And if not, how can it be fixed?
undefined says @iamoracle | Celo @jcortejoso | cLabs maybe you can help here ☝️
undefined says @jcortejoso | cLabs is in the best person position to help with the question.
undefined says @zambogami are you observing that in validators or fullnodes?
undefined says @zambogami this is an expected behaviour. The extraData field has the `IstanbulAggregatedSeal` which has the signatures of the validators that signed the block that the actual validator "got".
So, in every block, every validator will get consensus on the block when they reach 2/3+1 of signatures then, they will wait a short period, to retrieve more signatures from the other 1/3-1 validators. But that block is already valid. We wait a little to collect the majority of signatures possible for our uptime score mechanism, BUT it's impossible for us, to have every block with the same signatures each (if we had to address that we would need to reach consensus on those signatures which is an unnecessary cost). So we have an scenario, when the same block, could have different signatures (each of the block will have more than 2/3+1 of the signatures, but not necessary the same ones). As an example, if you have 4 validators, you can have the same valid block with the signatures 1,2,3 or 2,3,4 or 1,3,4 or 1,2,4, or even 1,2,3,4.
This is why we need the ParentSealBitmap, because for the uptime score, we will need to have all the validators in the same page to be able to calculate the same uptimeScore. Which means that the Proposer of the block N+1, will use the seal that that validator has in its N block, to save its bitmap, which then, all the validators will use.
So, TL;DR, it's an expected behaviour.
undefined says @Ponti | cLabs Thank you very much, I understand.
Isn't there some parameter in the config that allows you to disable the return of this field for RPC?
This behavior is not appropriate for our load balancer (i am from Ankr team) and we wouldn't want to rewrite the code.
undefined says I think that you can filter fields using graphql, but not with an rpc call. You will probably need to create some addapter
undefined says got it, thanks!
undefined says Hi, I was developing an NFT dApp for the BWC social hackathon, needed some help with viewing NFTs on the testnet, is there any marketplace?
undefined says Tofu Nft should help
undefined says Could you point me to where I can checkout NFTs on alfajores, can't see a testnet option on their website
undefined says hey Ayush, apologies, unfortunately I couldn't see tofu showing on celo testnet. But if you verify your NFT contracts you should be able to see your NFT on Celo Explorer
undefined says However, I did see tofu nft support NFTs on zksync testnet. I also think Celo tracker also doesn't support viewing assets on testnet
undefined says got it, will give it a try
undefined says As Elio mentioned, there aren't any testnet NFT sites for Celo yet unfortunately, but you might be able to accomplish what you want by forking a repo.
undefined says Hello guys.. 
is there any way to between exchange stablecoins? 
For example cUSD to cEUR..
undefined says Yes I would recommend mento
undefined says Although you should also check out Uniswap, UBeswap
undefined says This is the mento link:

https://mento.finance/
undefined says You may sometimes find a better deal on Uniswap or Ubeswap or another DEX depending on the situation, but Mento is always a good option
undefined says Yes mento is a good option
undefined says Does anyone use the `--disablerpcethcompatibility` flag when running their celo-blockchain node? If there are no users, we would consider removing the option.
undefined says hey! 

I found in the documentation that transaction fees can be paid in ERC20 tokens, and not just the native token of the protocol, CELO (which I think is amazing btw), but I can't seem to find how to change the feeCurrency field. Any support would be SUPER appreciated 🙂
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Are you writing a custom DAPP?
undefined says You can use the Celo contractkit. Just set the feeCurrency to cUSD or cEUR.

https://docs.celo.org/developer/contractkit/setup

https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-transactions-lesson/blob/master/lesson.js

use contract kit and Check line 109 here to reference to fee currency
undefined says Does anyone happen to have an example of using an in-memory signer with ContactKit?  I assume there's some class that implements contractkit's `Signer` deep in `web3` but I'm having trouble finding it.

I know there's `web3.eth.accounts`, but that seems to generate accounts on a remote node, which isn't what I want. I just want to load a private key into memory from a source other than a node (CLI, txtfile, etc)
undefined says could someone please give more detail on what exactly the command: celocli account:set-wallet is for
undefined says `Sets the wallet of a registered account on-chain. An account's wallet is an optional wallet associated with an account. Can be set by the account or an account's signer.`

Basically allows signer to set his/her wallet on-chain
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/discussions/10311 interesting development
undefined says Hi! Do you know if Celo has already bundlers and entrypoint for erc4337?
undefined says I do not think so yet. However, there might be some developments in the community. cc: @0xArthur.xyz | cLabs are you aware of this or any recent developments?
undefined says Hello Everyone.  I've been trying to use contractkit to sign a transaction but i keep getting this error  "Error: Could not find address 0xd4f8a45dd68cee981c7357bd6693008d35941b7b" i double checked the address in question and it's a valid address on the alfajores testnet. Please can anyone help me out with this
undefined says I even upgraded the version of contractkit i have on my PC but i still couldn't get it resolved
undefined says For more clarification, i used 
let celoWallet = await kit.getWallet()
let signedCeloTx = await celoWallet.signTransaction(CeloTx)

web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(CeloTx, privateKey) seems to work but i still can't intiate a transaction even after signing
undefined says Maybe you can try opening a post in #🔖︱developer-forums
undefined says Okay thanks
undefined says I answered in the forum.
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says GM fam, wanted to ask if anyone knows if there's a Celo API available which covers same functionality as the Alchemy NFT API ? Can anyone point us in the right direction? 🙏  Many thanks!
undefined says Yes you can use Tatum NFT APIs
undefined says Thanks for that @ELIO | IntoTheVerse , will take a look
undefined says Hey guys, I have a question. Is there any way to redirect to the Metamask by simply clicking a button from a non-wallet browser on mobile and doing some transactions or like run some function from the smart contract? I know you can do some transactions via Deeplinks, but is there any other approach, like how the uniswap browser does their swap, when you click the button of swap, your Metamask app will open and sign the transaction. Is there any approach??
undefined says In mobile browser(non-wallet like Chrome, Safari) you can't do transactions or any kind of interaction with smart the s. But in uniswap when you try to swap your token from non-wallet browser, the metamask app will automatically open and confirm the transaction. Also in walletConnect they use same thing, when you click connect wallet from a non-wallet browser, your metamask app will open. My question is how they do that??
undefined says Hi @Ankush Banik, if I understand you, you need a button that opens up Metamask when you click on it. You also need to call contract functions from your app. To do this, you can use Celo Rainbowkit. 

 You can check the docs here: https://docs.celo.org/developer/rainbowkit-celo
undefined says No, I know that. you can connect wallet via rainbow kit, walletConnect etc. But I'm not sure about calling contract function from non-wallet mobile browser.. It gives you provider not found error in non-wallet browser in mobile
undefined says In either case you use deep links to Valora or MetaMask using Rainbowkit
undefined says Deeplink can't allow you to run any specific function from the contract. you can only do some transactions or redirect to dapp url using deeplinks. Also I want to return the transaction hash, which you can't do with deeplink...
undefined says You should be able to call methods after connecting your wallet. What are you building? I might be able to suggest some solutions.
undefined says If you run any function in mobile non-wallet browser, where you don't have access to any wallet extension, you got a "provider not found" error , since your browser can't support the method "window.ethereum"
undefined says You can connect to a mobile wallet like Valora etc.
undefined says const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org")

  const contract = new ethers.Contract(
    contractAddress,
    Abi,
    provider
  )

  const result = await contract.someFunction()
undefined says This will work without connecting any wallet.
undefined says This gives me an error
Error: sending a transaction requires a signer (operation="sendTransaction", code=UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION, version=contracts/5.7.0)
undefined says You can't send a tx without a wallet you can only query the blockchain.
undefined says hi @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation  , I have .env file with private key but still it says Error
undefined says 
undefined says It should be process.env.ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY
undefined says did you installed dotenv npm package??
undefined says it should process.env.ISSUER_PRIVATE_KEY
undefined says are you using an existing piece of code from any of the Celo repo?
undefined says Hey, I was curious about how epoch rewards for a validator could be higher than the target epoch rewards. For example, a single Figment validator in epoch 1144 earned 117.39 cUSD (https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/block/0x19df1df8420919cefd4bcfeec194b67428923af5844f4d43c63450fc34450d78/epoch-transactions). They have a group share of 0%, so the individual validators are getting everything.

However, according to the Celo explorer's epoch data for 1144, the validatorTargetEpochRewards is  117.1516571 (https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/api?module=epoch&action=getepoch&epochNumber=1144).

Can you help me understand how this is possible?
undefined says Hello, sorry to bother. I am trying to run a celo full node using the docker image & instructions found in the celo docs. When I use the docker command listed in the doc I receive the error `unknown flag: --verbosity`. Can anyone help me figure this out? thanks!

undefined says @Canna this should work. The error is due to verbosity.
undefined says well, the odd thing is, if i remove verbosity it will say the next one is wrong. It's like it's not recognizing $CELO_IMAGE as an executable even though I have it set as a parameter. Any advice on how to fix that?
undefined says tysm for the help btw
undefined says Did you export the $CELO_IMAGE environment variable?
undefined says export CELO_IMAGE=us.gcr.io/celo-org/geth:mainnet
undefined says export CELO_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=<YOUR-ACCOUNT-ADDRESS>
undefined says Replace <YOUR-ACCOUNT-ADDRESS> with your actual address.
undefined says ill give that a shot now, ty sir, ill report back shortly

undefined says Hey, I'm running the archival nodes. And I'd like to backup my data and reuse it. But it seems not working.

Currently, the archive data is not that large, so the time difference between syncing from scratch and using backup data is not that significant. However, I want to prepare for the case where the data becomes larger.

Can you check if it is possible to use a copied exisitng data directory? I'm asking because when running an RPC node in Celo, I entered the account address and each node has different account address. So I'm wondering because of that that the backup data is not compatible.
undefined says I think @jcortejoso | cLabs would be the best person to answer this question.
undefined says Hi buddies,

Could you help us understand how celocli creates keys on the ledger? We are a bit confused about this process.

When we use the "celocli account:list --useLedger --ledgerAddresses 5" command, we get these addresses:

'0x4e8C3050D517d7337ECcb670c66312bFEB499445',
'0xf8e1B7F0964a0866b4fdd9BFFe7C9604B34cC0ee',
'0x0a6C309aA9743d6Ad6FD65335995C1349FA1c009',
'0x0C6fa8eD0186f813Ae8B219eC1fCa4d7E3AFC6Cd',
'0x1717D932e8851e9be4ef4859CD72032199063AA2'

However, when we try to access the ledger keys in Metamask, we get different addresses both when importing the ledger recovery phrase and when connecting to the ledger one by one.

The addresses that Metamask shows are:

0xc1B5324657503d6af063E1A42230740b0A51Dc00
0xe508181a88D8457EDcF125259bcD79df9018fc83
0xdD7a114BB1Ea19d762d3038cCa80E6624A99e1b2
0x11189F9ccE6d8451FFccB7cE33D083e9c915323E
0x547BF5d014e5CA7228b26CDa3416C0A39ccfa62b

Could you help us understand why the addresses do not match?

We would greatly appreciate any help you can provide.

Thank you!

undefined says Hey. Just had a quick question. Is the newest snapshot 4 months old at this point?
And do we have a snapshot for archive nodes?
undefined says is there a snapshot laying around? where can I grab it?
undefined says I should clarify, when I say I am looking for a snapshot. I am looking for an archive of the whole chain. Some protocols have a download for this.
undefined says I am looking for the same thing if such a snapshot is out there. 
Current mainnet snapshot only goes up to block 17mil or so.
undefined says joe where can I download that mainnet snapshot? Ill take 17mill hahah

Do they both contain the same amount of blocks? Is the difference solely the compression?
undefined says I answered in #support.
undefined says They contain the same data. The difference is in the compression format. ZStd compresses more but slower. LZ4 is faster but compression is lower leading to a larger compressed file.
undefined says Hi guys.
I'm new at blockchain develop and i have a question.
How to connect walletes like celoTerminal, celoExtension, Libera, besides valora and celo wallet (Celo have a tutorial in the doc)
I'm using RainbowKit and Next.js
Thank you very much and good luck guys!
undefined says celo extension wallet or celo web wallet is no longer working
undefined says https://docs.celoterminal.com/guides/using-walletconnect celo terminal can be connected using wallet connect
undefined says thank you!
undefined says Although there is no way to connect Celo Extension Wallet with rainbowkit?
undefined says Celo Extension Wallet is dead to be honest.
undefined says It was essentially created because Metamask a couple years back didn't support Celo yet.
undefined says I understand, but if someone still uses it i need to support them
undefined says Oh got it. Sorry I just logged in for the day and saw the end of the conversation.
undefined says don't worry

undefined says @densone I restored the snapshot (at block 17 mil) and after that sync to latest block took approx. 18 hours. Hope that helps answer how long it would take. My machine also has a lot lower specs than yours.
undefined says It seems after initial start up, the node goes through two phases:
- index each block from the snapshot
- start importing new blocks

undefined says Just guide him how to do this connection to Celo Extension Wallet
undefined says I can show simple extension wallet connection example but without the web3 modal
undefined says Thanks Joe. For some reason, it's ingesting blocks so slowly. I am not sure if it's because of p2p.
undefined says It actually seems faster starting from scratch for some reason.
undefined says oh interesting..  It seems to be just indexing.

undefined says Is this a full archive with traces etc?
undefined says Hey I'm not too sure about this. But @jcortejoso | cLabs is there a website that can show me all these details?
undefined says Hey all! Tomorrow Lava & LearnWeb3DAO are holding a special workshop to show developers around Lava SDK (Alpha) for multi-chain decentralized RPC, including Celo!!

Everyone is welcome to join, learn & build ❤️🧑‍💻
https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz/status/1675899938377699335
undefined says It is not archive gcmode, only full. So you cannot use for historical data
undefined says Hi guys
undefined says Does anyone knows how to setup wallet connect with rainbowkit for a celo DApp?
undefined says have you tried using Celo composer?
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer/rainbowkit-celo check this out
undefined says Next time you can post messages like this only on #💼︱jobs-cvs
undefined says Hello, I had a quick question: which signature scheme does Celo use to sign the transactions?
undefined says Do you mean the hashing algorithm? The Celo Blockchain uses Keccak256.
undefined says Not actually, I was asking the signature scheme like ethereum uses ecdsa to sign the transactions
undefined says “The Celo protocol uses BLS signatures in consensus to ultimately determine whether or not a particular block is valid. Many BLS signatures over the same content can be combined into a single "aggregated signature", allowing several kilobytes of signatures to be compressed into fewer than 100 bytes, ensuring that the block headers remain compact and light client-friendly.” https://docs.celo.org/validator/key-management/detailed
undefined says It's using BLS for the validators but I guess it is different (probably ecdsa but I wanted to make sure)for the users since the returned signature's size from the following code snippet is 64 bytes :/
let celotx = await celotoken
  .transfer(addressTo, value)
  .send({ from: addressFrom});
undefined says I think for key generation (encryption and decryption) it used ECDSA and for verification it usually uses BLS since BLS is faster
undefined says Hi, is Plumo already deployed/working as zero knowledge solution of celo ? I am only able to find informations regarding those two phases 2020/2021 and the plumo channel in here seems to be gone 🤔
undefined says Hey do we have a snapshot that contains the historical data?
undefined says You mean backups?
undefined says backups have changed to  https://storage.googleapis.com/celo-chain-backup/mainnet/chaindata-latest.tar.lz4
lz4 tool in needed now to decompress (available for all distros I checked), you can use ```lz4 -dc chaindata.tar.lz4 | tar -xvf -```
undefined says This backup contains all the historical data? I can use debugtrace calls?
undefined says cc: @jcortejoso | cLabs will be able to assist you better
undefined says Hey guys! I’m Vanya, with my team we`re on an exciting mission to make web3 and defi more accessible. Recently we’ve started opening up our infrastructure to devs, allowing them to use our mission control API to access blockchain data and our execution layer. Looking forward to connecting with devs here to find out what their needs are!
undefined says Hey guys!
i'm creating a Smart Contract to mint NFT with ERC1155, but i don't know how to store many uris for different NFT.
That is, i have several collections with several nfts with different attributes, i want to store them all in the same Smart Contract, som resource?
Thx
undefined says you can use `Ownable` in your smart contract and modifier called OnlyOwner in your contract that specifies it can only be set by the owner of the token. Additionally you can pin metadata of your NFT to the smart contract using servces like NFT.storage
undefined says https://youtu.be/19SSvs32m8I check this out @LuisEduardo
undefined says Hello, how i can put prices based on CUSD on a SM in solidity
undefined says btw, can somebody send me a bunch of celo tokens in Alfajores TestNet @ELIO | IntoTheVerse  @Viral | Celo , maybe one of you?
undefined says https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpt3WikYt5-TsDHmUgfFCbZjmZMcWr9bO5H0csHcmMrl9sFw/viewform?pli=1
undefined says Did not get you
undefined says Maybe @vissequ or @TQT did
undefined says @ELIO | IntoTheVerse  
I think he is asking how to put prices of NFTs in cUSD instead of Celo to be minted. 
Maybe is trying to make a contract for NFTs but wants to put the price of the NFTs in cUSD.
undefined says use the faucet https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores or post your address and someone will send 🙂
undefined says 0x34107Bce5EC357cE31739B84454c2c555a677568
undefined says Thats my address
undefined says Yes, exactly that
undefined says How much do you need?
undefined says https://github.com/critesjosh/celo-transactions-lesson/blob/1d3aba10f6afa9936fade164a87a4ee05bdd9250/webpage/index.js#L7 

Check from line 7 here we import erc20 abi and use cUSD contract address on testnet to call transfer function.
undefined says https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/127005 

@LuisEduardo a similar example but token address here should be the cUSD token address on alfajores. They’re using the ‘IERC20’ token interface
undefined says THXS
undefined says umm
undefined says I have another question man, where i can see nfts deployed at Celo Alfajores TestNet?
undefined says I am not aware of any current service that does that (but there could be). OpenSea has a testnet, but doesn't support Celo. TofuNFT supports Celo, but, at least as of a few months ago, did not have a testnet
undefined says Umm man
undefined says btw, how i can send an amount to a payable smart contract with contract kit?
undefined says the docs are so weird
undefined says Hi @LuisEduardo,
‘’’
let contract = new kit.connection.web3.eth.Contract(ABI, address); // Init a web3.js contract instance
let name = await instance.methods.getName().call(); // Read contract state

const tx = await instance.methods
  .setName(newName)
  .send({ from: account.address, feeCurrency: cUSDcontract.address,  value: amountInWei});
’’’


Adapted from https://docs.celo.org/developer/contractkit/usage
undefined says Umm, if i want to call a payable function with some args?
undefined says Yeah. Check the examples I sent, it has an argument.
undefined says If you use tatum services to mint NFTs you can fetch them using getNFTTransactions on a blockchain address
undefined says Question: once user authenticates on my Dapp via Web3auth (Twitter) and wallet is generated for them, how can I connect that wallet or make requests to the Celo network exactly? Kind of confused since I don't see Celo within the list that Torus provides
undefined says Does it generate the PK for you?
undefined says I think Web3Auth enables a semi custodial wallet
undefined says You should be able to load that pk on a MetaMask.
undefined says hey,hey

What is the best way to get the NFTs that belong to an address?
undefined says Solved, tatum, <https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/NFT-(ERC-721-or-compatible)#operation/NftGetTokensByAddressErc721> should do the task
undefined says I integrated Torus
undefined says All good now
undefined says awesome!
undefined says let me know if there are any further questions
undefined says @ELIO | IntoTheVerse Would you be able to help me with AA? I'm having hard time understanding how the executeTx works with GnosisSafeL2
undefined says I haven't tried it before, but could be able to help you if you guide me to the docs.
undefined says They don't have much documentation but here are relevant sources I researched and what I gathered this far:

1. Kernel - https://docs.zerodev.app/extend-wallets/overview Github: https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel
2. Patch Wallet implements AA with determenistic wallets, meaning user doesn't have to register on app to have wallet attached to his/her twitter @handle and can receive tokens/nfts. Github repo of their contracts (fork of above repo) - https://github.com/PaymagicXYZ/zerodev-wallet-kernel
3. Here's my transaction from Patch wallet - https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xf6bac6c91b352198aba2ca007ee518ed99342ddca9830de25a3b1fbd566cfcb9
4. My tx interacted with GnosisSafeL2 proxy - https://polygonscan.com/address/0x217006d2028b19b599815ed9a9dbd32d51710d9e#code
5. Owners of GnosisSafeL2 proxy are - deployer (Patch wallet) and 0x2BB655A15c96776B5A8Fa75EFD22B2c030098FfF - which happens to be some form of implementation of smart accounts - https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2BB655A15c96776B5A8Fa75EFD22B2c030098FfF?method=Exec__Transaction~0x6a761202

I'm trying to understand how everything ties in together.
undefined says https://github.com/PaymagicXYZ/patch-wallet-examples
undefined says This seems to be relevant as well
undefined says This seems to be used for NFT mint only. Found what I was looking for

https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xa073eb8b59edadd00e736f364ccd26ddaf57c9db01d3f55304e4d9f12de77d04
undefined says Started a thread.
undefined says Is there an EntryPoint & Bundler on Celo I can use?
undefined says Hi guys.. 
Anyone know what this erro means?

Error: Can't check tx fee cap: Exchange rate returned from the network is zero
undefined says Hey folks @Developer 💻 
Channel renamed to #🔗︱general-dev for general development discussions. 
Enjoy it 💻
undefined says Guys
undefined says The Valora wallet was developed using  Flutter?
undefined says Wich languages do you recommend me to use when developing a digital wallet?
undefined says I guess react native
undefined says Can you let me know where do you encounter this error? 
I think it’s mostly related to having celo for tx fee
undefined says Guys, another question, how i can get CUsd at Celo Alfajores?
undefined says it is possible?
undefined says Yes the faucet let you chose to receive also Cusd
undefined says **Faucet link:** https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores
undefined says If you want to receive also cUSD need to clear this checkbox. *(You will receive 0,5 of each Stable)*

**Tokens Contracts (Testnet)**
**-cUSD:** 0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1
**-cEUR:** 0x10c892A6EC43a53E45D0B916B4b7D383B1b78C0F
**-cREAL:** 0xE4D517785D091D3c54818832dB6094bcc2744545
undefined says You can also use Uniswap.org for exchange some Celo tesnet tokens for cUSD testnet tokens.
undefined says And last thing you can use is this form for larger requests *(You can find it in the Faucet page in the footer)*:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1n6m-nMjjDn2RpBDadMMqYpf5DzDTOeRk1dhDJrLFdO4/alreadyresponded
undefined says Hello, I just filled out the G-Form to request some tokens, I really appreciate if  ican get an answer quickly because I am Screwed because I dont have tesnet tokens and we are rushing in a develoment now.

Thanks for helping me, maybe @Viral | Celo l or @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation  can help thanks.
undefined says how many do you need?
undefined says let me know if you need more
undefined says Hi team 
I am setting up the Baklava testnet validator. My technical infrastructure is complete and have submitted request through G-form, as mentioned in the documentation, to receive the 12000 Baklava testnet CELO about three weeks ago!. I still haven't received any the faucet funds to my testnet validator and validator group addresses
It would be great if the admins could help with this issue at the earliest.
 The address are as follows :
CELO Validator Address : 0xa345043991804DA0315886D3B7819d98Ea66eA8f 
CELO Validator Group Address : 0xA0bf90ab165477cEb02840cF8022bc3f1Aa28beE
undefined says Maybe @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation or @Viral | Celo knows something about Baklava testnet tokens? If not let's try to find out who is in charge of this.
undefined says Hello, I have not yet received the CUsd that I requested in the form, I'm blocked
undefined says like 1000 CUSD
undefined says thats my address
undefined says 0x7742cECC61327B67e857A3De741bbb9Df8edb5BC
undefined says Here only goes the fee currency, I need to also pay the smart contract with CUSD in a value given by it, for example 10 USD
undefined says Did you receive cusd from the faucet ?
undefined says You need 1,000 alfajores celo?
undefined says I really managed with the faucet, although it would have been more comfortable to try with the prices that I already had given
undefined says Guys, does anyone know why wallet connect doesn't show me the CELO wallets, like Valora, Libera or Celo terminal?
undefined says i'm using rainbowkit-celo
undefined says i think valora should show, celo terminal should show. Not sure about Libera
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer/rainbowkit-celo
undefined says Please post Jobs offers in #💼︱jobs-cvs
undefined says hey! I just want to confirm a few things about using cUSD can be used to pay for gas fees in celo (rather than using CELO).

1. I believe we can use `setFeeCurrency` of contractKit passing the `cUSD` contract address and that'd be enough. Is that correct?

https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/21cdce6177329c49e646cd0a7ee9b2f7a06f5bfd/packages/sdk/contractkit/src/kit.ts#L198

2. is this doable using viem or ethers.js rather than contractkit? Any recommended sources/examples for that? Thanks
undefined says I need at least 1000 cUSD in testnet, and some Celo's I am testing a NFT contract that each NFT  cost 100 cUSD. 
I am just strugling because lack of those testnet tokens, really appreciate if you can help me I have already filled the form. but anyway this is my address if somebody wants to helps 0x7742cECC61327B67e857A3De741bbb9Df8edb5BC
undefined says No, I already fill out the gForm but have no answer.
undefined says And alsoo I have another question: How to see my NFTs in Alfajores testnet in a explorer or viewer, I mean i dont want to check them in the CeloExplorer, I want to use somethink like the OpenSea testnet frontend or something similiar *(I know opensea dont have Celo but maybe some other one have support for Celo Testnet)*
undefined says I'm sorry I only have alfajores Celo
undefined says I can send 1,000 Alfajores Celo if that helps. You would have to modify the testnet contract, but that is an option if it would help.
undefined says Dont worry, it works
undefined says Thx man
undefined says I can also do swap whit the, or if not as you say I modify the smart contract
undefined says For now we don’t have a standard testnet marketplace like opensea.  Tofu nft also shows mainnet NFTs. Celo Tracker also shows mainnet NFTs
undefined says Yes you have to modify smart contract
undefined says I request for some cUSDC test tokens: here is my alfajores account:0x93602D82D9eBB675294a3E70D7E2E07b41ba9D9f
undefined says We only have cUSD
undefined says You can use alfajores faucet
undefined says Its saying depleted
undefined says Oh how many do you need. Give me 5 mins
undefined says 10 are ok
undefined says Sorry I meant cUSD
undefined says sent you three
undefined says Thank you
undefined says I've tried to upgrade my project from web3 1.1 to 4.0.1, I use my local IPC node to connect but it is raising an error 'MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected.' when connecting to the Celo node and interacting with a contract. 
**Has any Celo project migrated to v4?** If some have a good experience migrating to v4 I will insist, otherwise I will stick to 1.1 as it seems the most recent version raises issues in IPC or wss connection to Celo
undefined says I use eth_getBlockByNumber from CELO. There is a problem that the gasPrice of a specific transaction is null. Those whose ethCompatible is false are the targets. 
Celoscan.io shows me after calculating well, what RPC method can I use to find the gasPrice value?
undefined says Hey @kewl let me check this for you
undefined says Let me revert back on this son
undefined says probably a node js event emitter issue. This is a known issue and as a result devs us `ethers` https://github.com/web3/web3.js/issues/3042#issuecomment-1414395591
undefined says https://github.com/web3/web3.js/issues/3042#issuecomment-663622882 there has been a workaround, but not sure if it will persist
undefined says https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/eth-rpc-api-docs i guess it is `eth_blockNumber`
undefined says if you're using Infura RPC then check this out https://docs.infura.io/networks/celo/json-rpc-methods
undefined says Question: which library should we use to connect to Celo from a Flutter App?
We were using https://celo.academy/t/build-a-simple-forum-dapp-with-flutter-on-celo/97 (like mentioned here) but it's no longer supported since Metamask updates... so our app can no longer connect to Celo 😬
undefined says Yes this is it, event emitter issue. I am happy to migrate to ethers, then I had issues few months ago when I tried to migrate the same Celo project to ethers v6 (more configuration issues of what ethers was expecting from the node). Have Celo projects migrated successfully to ethers v6.7 ?
undefined says cc : @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says since ethers v6 is stil fairly new, it should work out of the box though however we haven't moved any project to v6 yet
undefined says @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation Celo block explorer internal transactions section is not loading anymore for me 😦 Can you check if is a broader problem?
undefined says loading for me
undefined says Ok thanks
undefined says Ethers v6 was problematic for me. Had to downgrade to earlier version.
undefined says cc: @Viral | Celo should be a good person to help with flutter
undefined says seems like Celo RPC (forno) is having issue
undefined says looks good
undefined says is there a google cloud credit for CELO devs @ELIO | IntoTheVerse 
I'm guessing I once an announcement related to that but can't find it.
undefined says There are google cloud credits for startups building on celo
undefined says I’m not sure about independent devs.
undefined says Check out google startup pathway
undefined says Alright thanks.
undefined says Hello guys can we get somo testnet tokens *(Celo and cUSD)* please to test our dAPP we are building.
Our wallet for test purpouses is 0xDD8422dA958D7B9773B033717ECCCE0fBB26CE01
undefined says sent!
undefined says Hi, is there any simple example of celo dApp projects developed in react-native?
undefined says Gm
undefined says Yes
undefined says https://celo.academy/t/build-a-react-native-dapp-using-celo-composer/409
undefined says Try Celo Composer
undefined says Hey, we are building on-chain trading platform on Celo. Looking for development support and grants. Who would be the right person to speak to? 🙂 www.smartwhales.ai
undefined says You can check our prezenti.xyz
undefined says GM! Question: I am trying to execute a transaction on safe.global w/ ledger . It asks me to enable blind signing. Even after I have already done it, it keeps me asking the same. Has anyone been trough the same and know how to fix? TU
undefined says Hey all - attempting to request some Alfajores Testnet tokens from https://celo.org/developers/faucet and receiving the message  "Unable to faucet - This is probably because faucet needs refilling". Does anyone have any advice on alternative faucets or sources for these? Thanks in advance!

Here's my wallet address: 0x0390c18aeE302544b8e5FdA8305110e0efc5b6A0
undefined says do you need celo and cusd?
undefined says how many?
undefined says sent you 1celo 2cusd
undefined says Really appreciate that!
undefined says https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores use this faucet!
undefined says Oh perfect thank you 🫡
undefined says Thank you for your sharing. About this repo, I tried running on the Android emulator, the transfer fund doesn't working well. It returns "undefined", seems like have problem in sendTransaction problem, how can I solve this?
undefined says One more question, I'm trying to add celo phone number mapping to the app, I found an example repo from this discord https://github.com/critesjosh/register-number.git, and tried running it. It returns following error when i run yarn sample-script. I don't know how to get this "DEK private key". The error looks like happend in getHashAndPepper function.
undefined says Make sure you have your private key in the .env. This could be a MetaMask wallet key on celo network or one generated by the command yarn new-account 

Also make sure you are using node 12 using nvm
undefined says I tried this a long time ago and it was working fine for me
undefined says Firstly, @Neil we’re you able to receive the three sms otp or codes to the number you register ?
undefined says What is the node version you are using ?
undefined says Is this the expo version you are running?
undefined says have you checked out the example code in https://github.com/celo-org/SocialConnect ?   (The DEK can be set using the Accounts smart contract.)  @aaron | cLabs | pretty clueless @alec | cLabs can provide more pointers
undefined says Thank you for your reply. I've used nvm 12 and also set up the private key generated from running yarn new-account, still get the same error. I'm not able to get sms opt or codes.
undefined says yes you can use social connect as well!
undefined says yes it I'm using expo running the app on android emulator. using node 18. It seem like currency issue? doesn't show the a-celo balance on testnet network. And for the first time sent, it returns undefined, send time, it returns an error of insufficient funds
undefined says im trying to create a safe on celo, but there seems to be two different platforms
1. .https://safe.celo.org/welcome by celo
2. .https://app.safe.global/welcome?chain=celo by safe 

Which should i opt for ideally?
@ELIO | IntoTheVerse
undefined says Celo Safe was a fork of Safe before Safe integrate Celo. But now I prefer to use just Safe
undefined says Alright copied.
undefined says official one by safe.
undefined says I am using:
Git Version : 2.40.0
Node Version: v16.4.2 , >=v16.8.0
Npm version: 9.6.7
Nvm version: 0.39.3
undefined says I think it would be better to create a post on the forum #🔖︱developer-forums . in that way the issue could be  potentially helpful to other dev. Sorry I have been away, let me try to reporduce this on my machine
undefined says last time it worked, I was using these settings
undefined says Thank you for your help. I think it's not about environment problem. In this demo, for greeter and send page, the function seems designed to transact in ethernet main network, because when I click on send greeting button, it automatically switch the network to mainnetwork, and for the send page, it shows balance 0.0, doesn't show the celo currency,  how can I  make it transact in celo test network(alfajores)?
undefined says will post it there later.
undefined says Can you try redeploying contract to alfajores using instructions in package json ?
undefined says Default network has been set to alfajores
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.js
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/hardhat/package.json
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer/blob/main/packages/react-native-app/components/BlockchainActions.tsx

This has been set to mainnet
undefined says I tried deploy again, but it still looks like connecting to mainnet, because I have some tokens in testnet, but it still returns balance 0.0
undefined says https://celo.academy/t/build-a-react-native-dapp-using-celo-composer/409
undefined says Check this out
undefined says Yes, I tring this repo, problems happend from here.
undefined says I tried to upload .sol source and metadata json to the blockscout address verifier, get a 406 in return. no other info. is that expected?
undefined says were you able to solve this?
undefined says are you trying to verify your contract on testnet?
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/developer/verify check this out Lash!

undefined says Wondering if i crate a safe account on say CELO, does the same address still work on say optimism?
undefined says No. Safes are Smart Contract developed in each network. So is not gonna work.
undefined says No. It doesn’t
undefined says It clearly states python version is missing. I hope the steps suggested solves it.
undefined says Hi, I'm receiving the following error on my Celo mainnet archive node. Would anyone know how to get past this & resume syncing?

`WARN [08-23|13:40:25.384] Synchronisation failed, dropping peer    peer=72c0f84818e3b8837d70e04ed76e7543738a606bc91d143d3968adaad297e559 err="action from bad peer ignored: returned headers 192 != requested 1"

This is already synced from block 0 to 5 months ago, and 1.6TB in size.
undefined says OFF-TOPIC: [Open-Source] If you could not afford to setup a server to host a Celo node and if you want to optimize your RPC calls to it via Alchemy, Infura, Llamanode, and/or QuickNode in order to communicate your backend with your Web3 project, this might help your backend and save you money: https://github.com/jeffprestes/sjrpc
undefined says Thanks so much. Jeff 🤠

undefined says Does anyone know how to chose oracle reporter?

After reading code and docs, I thought it seems that we have to trust reporter for price oracle.

https://docs.celo.org/protocol/stability/oracles
undefined says cc: @Harpal Jadeja | Celo Foundation
undefined says if there is an Oracle that you want on Chainlink then I would suggest that

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=celo
undefined says Thank you!
I am writing about cUSD and I want to know which oracles are used for cUSD?
undefined says I think you should ask Mento Team or join their server and ask.
undefined says OK thank you!
undefined says https://github.com/celo-org/celo-oracle

https://docs.celo.org/protocol/stability/doto

Check if this helps. I don’t think there’s a cUSD price feed oracle address on Chainlink mainnet or testnet apart from CELO token.

undefined says Hello all!
What are the possible methods to get a list of validators?
undefined says You can get them from here:
https://thecelo.com/validators
undefined says Thanks! And is there any celo SDK to get the validators list ? (except the cli)
undefined says I think is only CeloCLI
undefined says celocli validator:list
undefined says Hey all. If I am running a Celo mainnet archive node, when should I think about upgrading the node to the new image. I see 1.8.0-stable is out. The hardfork is scheduled for Tuesday September 26th. Would I just need to make sure that I upgrade the node before that date?
undefined says Maybe some @Validators  ✅ can anwer this specific question.
undefined says Hi, I'm trying to setup a celo mainnet archive node via kubernetes. I noticed one of the health checks is to look for a file `/data-shared/ready` , the pod is currently set to RUNNING status but isn't set to READY (0/1). I can see the logs and it is crawling data but I'm unable to actually access it from the Load Balancer service because the health check didn't pass and the pod isn't "ready"
Does anyone have any information on this?
undefined says Hi, let’s see if validators will be able to help. Thank you!
undefined says That's right, you need to be on 1.8.0 anytime before the hardfork happens.
undefined says Anyone with Blockchain exp, interested in teaming up for an ongoing hackathon, please DM!
undefined says Hi, can you please post in #💼︱jobs-cvs
undefined says @jcortejoso | cLabs can you help here?
undefined says Hi @DeadlyGhost ! Is the node already synced? The readinessProbe is intended to only pass when the node is synced.
If you prefer to DM me the yaml for the statefulset/pod and I can confirm if it looks good
undefined says Hi devs, I'm working on a small project and about to go live on mainnet. I need help with the best probably free public rpcnode to use.
undefined says https://docs.celo.org/network/node/overview
undefined says Hi, there is a Chainlink Oracle for track the price of cUSD/USD?
I'm using chainlik to resolve prices of some tokens in diferent networks and need to include the cUSD/USD rate.
Thanks.
