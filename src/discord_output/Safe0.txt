undefined says The Safe core contributors team is relatively small, and we cannot keep up with the volume of developer questions we receive using a chat model. For this reason, we decided to move our developer support to Ethereum Stack Exchange.
By doing this, we will create a knowledge base for Safe products and developer tools, indexed by search engines, making life easier for developers who will build on top of the Safe protocol in the future!

**Please post your question here -**
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gnosis-safe
Please be as detailed as possible and don’t forget to add `gnosis-safe` tag to your question 🙏 StackOverflow’s guide to asking a good question may be helpful:

**Types of dev support questions and where to ask:**
- How do I? -- Ask in Stack Exchange with `gnosis-safe` tag
- I got this error, why? -- Ask in Stack Exchange with `gnosis-safe` tag
- I got this error and I’m sure it’s a bug -- file an issue in the relevant Github repo within https://github.com/safe-global

undefined says Guys you need to see this
undefined says @Deleted User
undefined says Can i get some help pls
undefined says eth:0xfF501B324DC6d78dC9F983f140B9211c3EdB4dc7
undefined says Scammer gnosis address, took alot from not just me
undefined says I know you you guys prob cant do much but you could prob not give him the airdrop maybe idk 🤷‍♀️
undefined says You can literally see the scam tokens if u follow the tx from the link 😂
undefined says This is our demo safe, how did they scam you?
undefined says Oh sorry it wasnt from u guys at all,
undefined says Theyre simply just using ur platform because it apparenlty is the best 😊
undefined says https://bscscan.com/token/0x0ec76648de2CfbCb0eeC07beA0016e558CD66764
undefined says received this airdrop in my gnosis wallet, seems scammy
undefined says @Gnosis Dao Community/MOD
undefined says I got this URL from someone
undefined says https://gnosis-safe.roninchain.com/#/welcome
undefined says is this a scam?
undefined says This is not deployed by the Gnosis Safe team. Please check with Ronin team.
undefined says Not a scam, but this Safe version is maintained by the Ronin chain team and not by the Safe team
undefined says so it's an unofficial deployment
undefined says Got it.
undefined says Is the gnosis UI now having ppl sign eth raw messages?
undefined says Cause the UI is trying to get me to sign this: https://i.imgur.com/L99EWqU.png
undefined says Not familiar enough with Linux UI (assuming that's where it's from, based on UI), but that's a window popup, not a Metamask extension popup
undefined says We figured it out. Its having us sign the safetxhash
undefined says It really shouldn't be doing raw signatures though. Very sketchy
undefined says Does Firefox on Linux put Metamask into a modal window, though?
undefined says Yeah it does
undefined says Brave on manjaro
undefined says Okay then. That set off more alarm bells than the signature request, actually 😬 On Win/Mac, the popup doesn't have the window chrome
undefined says it looks like lattice doesn't support eth_signTypedData
undefined says we try signing with eth_signTypedData, eth_sign, on-chain approval
undefined says in that order
undefined says It actually does. The bug happened I think because my lattice disconnected
undefined says unfortunately we don't know what methods a wallet supports
undefined says However it always happens to trezor cause they don't support EIP-712
undefined says My concern was that it appeared to be using an eth raw signature which is somewhat unsafe
undefined says versus the other sig that prepends the ETH SIGNED DATA thing

undefined says Hi guys, got hijacked in a multi sig account, is it impossible to recover the funds?
undefined says Funds sent to another address will be irreversible thus no chance to recover. If one of your owner addresses is compromised please remove or replace it immediately.
undefined says we did a multi sig with gnosis safe with 2 owners, so probably impossible to recover
undefined says damn but, 2 people hijacked together?
undefined says btw not sure if this is the right channel to report these kind of scams, but scam airdrops appear in my safe:

undefined says https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9E2d266D6c90F6C0D80a88159b15958f7135B8Af
undefined says @Mitchy is a scammer, watch out
undefined says Hi, can you share a screenshot of the conversation please?
undefined says he deleted his messages before I could sc
undefined says furthermore he periodically changes his user name
undefined says reason he deleted is because I called him out on chat, I should've screenshotted before in hindsight
undefined says his usernname is khalid now but it was rose before
undefined says ^
undefined says Hey guys my safe has been compromised
undefined says Got 6k usd sitting there I can't access
undefined says Please click on the chat icon at the bottom right part of this site https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome for support/help.
undefined says The lady there was no help I was hoping a dev could do something
undefined says Found your ticket. I believe they were able to explain to you why you are now locked out from your safe. Im sorry but if one of the owners does not confirm/sign transactions nothing can be executed and your funds will be stuck in the safe forever. 😢
undefined says Just in case someone already did, DO NOT accept help in direct messages, they are all scammers.
undefined says Hey I have a new issue
undefined says The guy has replied but the wallet seems to be having a technical issue with the Execute feature
undefined says Please use the chat feature here https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome for support/help.
undefined says My bad. Thank you
undefined says I'm seeing apecoin scams in my gnosis wallets. Also seeing a coin scam that actually increased the value of my safe.
undefined says Hi, I've reported this to the team.
undefined says Cool. Just want to let people know here as well.
undefined says They have added more than a few hundred thousand to liquidity. That’s why maybe? So, either the scammers or the market has created a market value for this coin.
undefined says Why is my gas charged repeatedly?
undefined says all confirmed
undefined says Most likely you did multiple confirmations. Please use the chat support feature on the site here https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome for help/support.
Bottom right chat icon.
undefined says hi，I was doing a rabbit hole quest and asked to create 2 signers, I added 4, then I removed 2 is it still possible to complete the quest
undefined says you would have to ask the rabbithole team directly. We don't manage this quest.
undefined says where can i currently stake my tokens to be eligible for the Safe airdrop?
undefined says Suspicious SAFE token transaction. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x41ace89b8a97ca335525f4942dac667a1fc15c150dcb0289efd145896595ef2a.  Being airdropped to hundreds of accounts.
undefined says How many addresses to transfer coins to say why the acceptance address is invalid?
undefined says Hi there. Please open a ticket via the chat icon on the Gnosis Safe web app here https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome or reach out via Gnosis Safe DM on Twitter https://twitter.com/gnosisSafe
undefined says I successfully submitted the hash for creating the safe box, but the system displayed an error because the gas was low. I repeated the submission twice, and now the original page still shows an error. When I reopen the safe box, the safe box creation is always in the loading state. . what should i do now

undefined says How do we go about filtering out scam tokens from being listed in the "assets" in a gnosis safe?
undefined says It's not possible at the moment. This feedback has been forwarded to the team already
undefined says It's super annoying
undefined says Glad I'm not the only one that's reported it.
undefined says Yeah, it is 😬
undefined says As a suggestion, it seems that it should be reasonable to have a toggle for "hide ERC20 assets without verified contract source code" or something like that.
undefined says That would actually cover 80% of the scam / spam tokens in my safe
undefined says Hi there, yeah, it is already being considered for development: https://github.com/gnosis/safe-react/issues/3362
undefined says 
undefined says 🔨
undefined says @Tomek
undefined says scam?
undefined says Hi there, `@KristinaMayman#8123` is part of the Gnosis safe team.
undefined says hey
undefined says i want a token of our safe not to be shown, how i can do that
undefined says https://etherscan.io/address/0x106EebF11F34ECCcaD59c1CA9398d828765f64f8
undefined says that one
undefined says Hi. There is no option in the safe to hide tokens yet. A feature request for this has already been submitted to the team I believe.
undefined says Hi all. Just a heads-up that the team behind a blockchain known as "candle" or Candle Labs have been soliciting work from consultants (in regards to Gnosis-related development) through this server, under various names (Sam Walker, walkerranger on Telegram), and are performing wage theft. We have had more than $2k in wages stolen, and other people outside our team have similarly reported wage theft. Be careful!
undefined says Indeed, the Candle CEO that reached to me goes by the name @walker in this server
undefined says I also confirm @dionyziz’s report. @walker also solicited work from my side for Gnosis related development and didn’t pay according to our signed contract.
undefined says Hi, please share a screenshot of the conversation. We can only report server members that you have conversations with in Discord.
undefined says 
undefined says Lol. You guys didn’t do any work. The PR was never merged, the code was sloppy, and you wanted $40,000+ when anyone could’ve done it in an hour.
undefined says We can only ban users that are obviously scamming. e.g. asking for seed phrases, private keys or sending links that would ask for those, etc
undefined says Is this obvious enough?
undefined says We'll leave the decision to the devs about this.
undefined says I mean that’s legal
undefined says Sam, you said you made a payment and you haven't.
undefined says This was an outright lie.
undefined says There was also no expression that you were unhappy with our work, you just left the chat after we asked for a receipt.
undefined says Come on now 🙂

undefined says HI,  I have been scammed by your website
undefined says What the fuck is going on? I thought it was a fake website biut its actually the real one
undefined says Why did you stole my money?
undefined says Please open a ticket via the chat icon on the Gnosis Safe web app here https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome so we can check further
undefined says Open a ticxket on the website that stole everything from my fucking metamask? Are you for real?
undefined says You stole me
undefined says We can chat here. Please explain what happened.
undefined says I tried to create a multisig wallet with your safe yesterday night
undefined says they asked me to enter my metamask seed phrase, on metamask what I did as your site seemed legit
undefined says and this morning I realised that my whole metamask was empty
undefined says Sorry for your loss but any platform asking for your seed phrase is trying to SCAM you

You share your keys, your loose your fund. Don't do that

SAFE will never ask for your seed phrase/private keys
undefined says Please share the website URL
undefined says I'm assuming you are using the MetaMask wallet extension here so you need to have already set up your wallet address in the MetaMask extension app. If you haven't, then yes you will need to go through importing your seedphrase/private keys but this is done on the MetaMask app itself and not on the Safe web app. The Safe web app will NEVER ask for your seedphrase or your private keys. If you have unauthorized transactions in your wallet, then you might have accessed a scam site or your wallet or computer is compromised.
undefined says Safe did
undefined says Share the website URLamd share some screenshots relating the incident
undefined says How can I get the screeshots from the incident?
undefined says It was yesterday, there were no incindents yesterday
undefined says I realised it this aftyernoon
undefined says www.user-gnosizsafes.xyz Shit, it wasn't the real website
undefined says Your system must have been compromised, friend or you've used your personal wallet (not SAFE) to interact with
undefined says Can you see.

It's a fake website
undefined says Here is the real website
https://gnosis-safe.io/app/welcome
undefined says Yes i know now
undefined says Sorry for your loss 😢 Please be careful next time.
undefined says next time lol they took everything
undefined says no next time
undefined says Next time if you don't know the real URL, ask in server but importantly, ignore any website asking for your seed phrase. The platform is trying to SCAM you
undefined says Yes! Next time

I have once lost 90% of my portfolio to a fake wallet too and I recovered from the loss.

I believe you will recover your loss with profit
undefined says Fuck
undefined says Guys are you aware of the Reality.eth module exploit? My team has discovered it being able to drain funds from safes using iy
undefined says Cc: @Lukas |  Safe ^^
undefined says if you're talknig about this https://hackmd.io/g0txop3tTfGxcNKxn4z4Jg?view then yes we're aware
undefined says as it is highlighted in the article is not really a module exploit but a lack of monitoring and attention
undefined says and just to clarify we don't maintain the reality.eth module, it is maintained by https://www.gnosisguild.org/
undefined says I've been in conversation with Lukas about this for a while today
undefined says This is not simply a case of not paying attention ser.
An attacker was able to bypass an entire Snapshot voting system, create (spoof?) a proposal on their own that used a proposal_id already used once in the past by the DAO. Then set a very short amount of time period, and pass it on their own
undefined says It's a Storage Collision Attack at the contract level
undefined says An outsider being able to access funds inside a safe, while not being an owner of the safe, not being an eligible voter in Snapshot either
undefined says Update: the Storage Collision doesn't affect the Reality Contracts, only fake swaps that the attacker had created.
undefined says This is what happened
undefined says They were able to put malicious txn instructions in the eip712 hash, since the reality module just passed it, the Gnosis safe also passed the txn, which included token approval and transfer functions and the attacker was able to swipe the funds
undefined says how to report scam ?
undefined says Please share the details here.

undefined says @Deleted User
undefined says Banned them. You'll probably get more in DMs. Please block and report anyone who reaches out to you in DMs offering help/support, there are scammers lurking. Safe team and support members will NEVER DM you first.

https://twitter.com/safe

Which one is real? I am confused
undefined says Depends if you sign something or entered your seed (for EOA) when you connected. Try running antivirus as well if ever there was a download
undefined says https://twitter.com/safe
undefined says didn't download anything and check at revoke.cash. 
No allowance found to any smart contract
undefined says and Didn't type seed phrase
undefined says But The one you mention real safe twitter account tweeted his tweets.
 https://twitter.com/safe/status/1605237225737912320

undefined says You can't remove, but there should be a "Hide asset" button on the very right part of each token when using the safe web app https://app.safe.global

undefined says Hello, I am using a multisig address on the Goerli testnet environment and cannot complete the OpenSea signature verification login.
undefined says Hello, none of the stuff documented in the user-support channel works (no chat icons are visible on any of the sites linked), so reaching out here. Our startup is attempting to bridge USDC using Wormhole from Celo to Eth Mainnet and our Gnosis SAFE is stuck showing a transaction that has long since completed. On Etherscan we can see that the bridge worked, but we can't view our assets from the SAFE. Would appreciate any help or links to docs/resources that might help

undefined says I hope this is the correct channel to ask. Regarding the massive distributed hacks and wallet drains happening currently (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12s45c5/an_update_on_the_crypto_hack_currently_taking/). **Does anybody know, if Safe Smart Contract multi-sig wallets also have been drained?** I've only limited amounts of money there, so I've not been pwned currently. Or perhaps the hackers haven't implemented that.

On that regard, would it be possible to actually implement a variation of Gnosis Safes, where the owners are NOT publicly visible? (https://etherscan.io/address/0xE0a88c4E543a0e0d15d697403849A75Da40962B4#readProxyContract). Such a feature could provide interesting privacy guarantees and at the same time it could also shield the above attack, because the attacker would need to know which owners are used and cannot simply look them up on chain. Obviously this has drawbacks in case one forgets some of the owners, but nevertheless, it's interesting.
undefined says No. Also, Safes are smart contract wallets, unlike those described in the article. Depending on the policy you set, having one owner wallet compromised will not immediately give access to the scammer/hacker.
undefined says Indeed. Enough signers need to be compromised to hack the gnosis safe. I am asking whether perhaps the hacker didn't brother implementing this for gnosis safes, since going for EOAs was already lucrative.

It's funny that months ago I decided for a gnosis safe instead of a hardware wallet - because I didn't like the *existence* of a single point of failure - the seed phrase. Maybe that's what has protected me until now with this current hack ^^'

undefined says Not sure if it's a scam but it's definitely not from Safe contracts.
undefined says exacly what i thought to, it doent seems to work but its annoying to see the safe showing up when switching to polygon chain, is there any way to remove it?

undefined says done
undefined says please, report the scammer's wallet address to be frozen
undefined says There's nothing we can do unfortunately. 😦 Blockchains are basically decentralized so no one can stop an anyone from using it. You could report it to USDT to block the address from using USDT itself, but there's no guarantee unfortunately.
