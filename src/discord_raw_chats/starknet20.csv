I am trying to use warp but I am facing the following issues:
- How do I check that my Solidity compiler version is >= 0.8.0 ? I usually use truffle and solc is installed locally but not globally. Should I installed it? Is it worth adding in the readme?
- In my contract, does this mean I can only transpile contract with `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` ?
- To warp a contract `contract test {}` in test.sol in the current directory, is the proper command ` warp transpile . test   ` or ` warp transpile test.sol test    ` or something else?
All of these fail with the same error","",""

- we only support the `^0.8.0` pragma so your contract will need to be prefixed with that and only use the associated solidity semantics. This is because we had to patch `solc` and we've only applied the patch to the latest version.
- `warp transpile test.sol test` is the correct command, the pragma change should fix the associated errors","",""

"242639311290368000","mempoolsurfer","15/02/2022 10:27 pm","@maciejka 

Ah yeah, this is because we do transpilation of the yul output of solc. This is a low level implementation of how solidity works which generates a single function that acts on solidity calldata including the function selector, as a result we only have one entry point (`__main`). Right now the best way to interact with these functions is through the warp cli which will transform the input data to match `__main`'s expectations.

The next release of warp will produce contracts that are a lot closer to the original solidity and will have abi's that resemble the original abi's (with the solidity types replaced with the equivalent representation in cairo types) .

Incidentally dropping this approach is part of the big optimisation in the next release","","üëç (1)"

- My ABIs will be same right? In UI I am assuming I wont have to make any changes
- I have a js script which I use to deploy a contract (using ethers). Major work of the script is to attach a facet to my diamond contract (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), I have a bit of doubt as to how this will work out. In the script I need to invoke functions from contract passing in some calldata as well, will that work if I pass the same into starknet? The question might sound dumb but sorry for that

I was an active developer/zk contributor back in the days when Groth16 was all the rage and have been following the developments with new proof systems, StarkNet and zkSync since then, but haven't been so active on the dev side. I don't have any experience with warp or Cairo, but started getting my feet wet with transpiling and deploying my first contract to the Goerli testnet yesterday and I have some basic questions; would appreciate if anyone could give me some feedback:
- what kind of efficiency gains can one expect from writing the contracts directly in Cairo as opposed to transpiling with warp?
- have there been any security issues reported on the Cairo code generated from warp so far?
- I read that there will be an audit of the warp codebase, but afaiu it hasn't been done yet; is there any ETA for it?

And a couple of more specific things I was pondering yesterday:
- when you run `warp deploy` or `warp invoke`, which account is paying for the tx fees on the Goerli testnet? I was able to run those commands without setting up a StarkNet account
- when I run `warp call` on a toy contract (a modification of the default Greeter contract from hardhat to have a uint256 instead of a string as the greeting), I get the following output:
```
 sancho@united ÓÇ∞ ~/src/warp-test ÓÇ∞ warp call --program Greeter.json --address 0x05d06996d67742c099c6a0bdb7fdbebb654974d7de2ae3f3de7f37fdee703fc8 --function greet --inputs '[]'

- Warp v1, which is the current release, transpiled YUL to cairo code. So the performance wasn't very good when we benchmarked it against handwritten ERC20 it was 30x-90x worse but we're working on Warp v2. Warp v2 transpiles solidity to cairo directly and the performance for that is much better, almost the same as native cairo. I have attached some graphs that show the performance for both versions against handwritten cairo code.

- Version 1 has been out for a couple of months and no one has got back to us with any security issues yet but obviously we can't be sure until the compiler has been audited.

- The current ETA for warp v2's start audit date is around start of June ¬± 1 week

- warp cli is just a wrapper over the starknet cli and its main job is to translate between the Ethereuem ABI and Cairo ABI. IIRC when v1 was released starknet cli did not have account support so whatever account starknet cli uses when no account is mentioned warp will also be using that account.

-  The first value 32 is the size of the result in bytes, the second value (2) there is the length of the result and the last two are the actual result. The result is two numbers because in YUL uint256 is the only type so the result of your call is a uint256 and in cairo a uint256 is represented as two felt (high and low). In this case 0 is the high component and 42 is the low component.

- The output in the second case follows the similar format (size, len, result). The string is encoded as numbers here and its big-endian since that's how strings are encoded on the EVM.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935889632124616765/961264941917159445/steps.png,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/935889632124616765/961264942147862631/warp_improvements.png",""

The extra level of indirection only comes into play with dynamic arrays and mappings. To allow the dynamic allocation of elements of such objects, extra storage vars are generated to hold the location in WARP_STORAGE of the elements.

For those who missed the announcement on Twitter, Warp 2.0 is under audit at the moment and available for use under the warp-ts branch on our repo: https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp. This version transpiles directly from solidity to Cairo. The resultant Cairo contracts are human-readable and should be shorter than Warp 1.0.

There is an updated readMe that has installation instructions and a list of features that are currently being developed/not supported.
