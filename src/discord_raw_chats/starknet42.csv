This is because the interface and the flow of StarkNet remains mostly the same. Nevertheless, we are working very closely with the tools to try and make this migration as soon as possible. To elaborate a bit - 
1. SDKs ( StarkNet.py, StarkNet.js, etc..) - they have the least amount of work as the interface of StarkNet does not change.
2. testing frameworks (protostar, hardhat) - many changes, some of them are already working on the migration (Protostar for example)
3. devnet - same as SDKs, not a lot of changes. They do need to support changes resulted by StarkNet v0.11.0, but I think this is not that big.","",""

2. `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff_u128` is the maximum value a `uint128` can take. A `uint256` is the combination a  `low uint128` and `high uint128`. Hence this checks if the current allowance is the maximum a `uint256` can take, what is also called infinite allowance in case of ERC20 standard. It's already the case in OZ ERC 20 contract both in Solidity in Cairo (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L324 / https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/src/openzeppelin/token/erc20/library.cairo#L284).

1. The `Storage` struct should be exposed should a `storage` module such that it supports the following access patterns:

```
#[contract]
mod token {
  struct Storage {
    name: felt,
    symbol: felt
  }

  #[constructor]
  fn constructor(name: felt, symbol: felt) {
    storage::name::write(name);
    storage::symbol::write(symbol);
  }
}
```

This makes sense to me because the current strategy make it unclear that you are adding all of your storage variables into the global namespace opening up the strong potential for identifiers overlapping implicitly.

2. To extend the first suggestion, I would change what I imagine is the current `#[contract]` macros convention of looking for a `Storage` struct, to instead supporting arbitrarily named structs which have the `#[storage]` macro defined above. Let me provide an example and, subsequently, the reasoning:

```
#[contract]
mod token {
  #[storage(Default)]
  struct metadata {
    name: felt,
    symbol: felt
  }
  
  #[storage]
  struct erc20 {
    balances: Map::<felt, u256>,
    allowances: Map::<(felt, felt), u256>
  }

  #[constructor]
  fn constructor(name: felt, symbol: felt) {
    storage::name::write(name);
    storage::metadata::symbol::write(symbol);
  }

  #[external]
  fn transfer(from: felt, amount: u256) {
    use storage::erc20::balance;

    let current_balance = balance::read(from);
    balance::write(current_balance - amount);
  }
}
```

In the constructor you can see how the `name` and `symbol` identifiers don't clash anymore, removing the need to suffix a `_` like `name_` in the constructor argument identifiers.

You can namespace storage variable for different concerns.

The `Default` argument to the `storage` macro can be allowed once and storage variables marked as `Default` should be available at the root of the `storage` module.","",""

```#[contract]

mod Simple {
    struct Storage{
        number_pair: LegacyMap::<felt, felt>,
    }

    trait IContract{
        fn set_something(num: felt, pair: felt);

    fn setter(num: felt, pair: felt) {

1) Is there no way to abstract the Trait and Impl to a different file and maybe import and use like we do in Cairo 0.x? Writing every thing in one file looks too clunky

2) If we were trying to call an already deployed contract on Starknet, can we say the already deployed contract is the impl, and as such just use a trait only with the reference to that impl probably by using a contract address, rather than re-writing the impl again?","",""

It would make sense to me that you don't `impl` explicitly in Cairo 1.0 like you do in Rust, instead you just implement the functions the trait requires and if you implement a trait completely then that contract has implicitly implemented a trait. If you think about, this makes sense because the compiler has no knowledge of the contract your contract will call at runtime and it also has no knowledge of the interface other contracts will be using to call your contract at runtime. Meaning, there would be limited utility in having the compiler ensure your contract conforms to a trait definition.

The trait is useful for the contract calling a contract which implements the expected trait. The trait definition helps the calling contract encode the function call, including the arguments, for the CALL syscall. This would be similar to Solidity. If the contract being called doesn't have a function with the required function selector which is derived from the trait definition, then the call will fail.","",""

It also doesn't conform with the idea of ""typed starknet"" (Adding linear type semantic to intercontract calls, like MOVE based languages, which has a lot of benefits)

This also has a problem of colliding functions. If i want to be both ERC20 and ERC721, or even implement ERC20 twice.

I strongly believe that abi should be declared as traits. When you implement them you ""use"" them as a crate in your code, and just do an impl. You can have multiple impls for your code.
When calling other contracts, you do it via a Dispatcher impl of the abi trait","",""

### Derive macros
```rust
#[derive(Copy, Drop)]
struct Point { x: felt, y: felt }

fn main() -> felt {
    let mut origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let a = origin.x;
    origin.x // returns 0
}
```

These derive macros are used by the compiler to create new¬†items¬†given the token stream of a¬†struct or an enum. Under the hood, the compiler actually generates this code:

```rust
// generated with: format!(""impl {name}{derived} of {derived}::<{name}>;\n""));
impl PointCopy of Copy::<Point>;
impl PointDrop of Drop::<Point>;
```

If you remove this macro, the compiler will throw this error

```jsx
error: Variable was previously moved.
 --> main.cairo:31:9
    let mut origin = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
        ^********^

error: Variable not dropped.
 --> main.cairo:32:9
    let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };};
```

With the instruction `let a = origin.x`, we‚Äôre taking ownership of the `origin` variable. Cairo 1 is similar to Rust on this point as a borrow checker makes sure no variable can be used twice and throws the `Variable was previously moved` error. In the return instruction, we're trying to use `origin` by returning `origin.x`, hence the error. By implementing the `Copy` trait for Position, values are implicitly copied instead of taking ownership.

The second error is `Variable not dropped`. In Cairo 1, every variable that is declared must be either returned at the end of the function or dropped. Custom types need top implement the `Drop` trait so that they can be dropped after they‚Äôre used.","","üëÄ (1)"

If the `base` address had the length and the elements of the array were stored sequentially in memory, then you could devise some algorithms to read the entire array. Would need to think of the patterns for when elements are non-felts or collection types, including packing types smaller than felts like `u8`.

For the write function it seems like you would only ever need to write to an index, not write the whole array. Which makes me think that maybe the storage for an array might benefit from being built through composition. The problem being that the `Array::<T>` needs to implement `StorageAccess` the way the storage mechanics are set up right now.

1. what is the right way to debug more than 31 bytes?
`error: The value does not fit within the range of type core::felt`
2. In general how to `debug` print 
3. guidance as to how to read the source code.
- what is `extern fn` `nopanic` . `extern fn array_new<T>() -> Array::<T> nopanic;`. why and what is this for?
- i have an understanding of rust trait system. ex. `ArrayTrait::new()` gives access to `.append`, but where does `array_append` go or where is it implemented? `crates` folder? 
4. `ref argument must be a mutable variable.` if this due to the memory model of cairo. where can i read more how the memory model is translated in cairo1?
5. In https://medium.com/nethermind-eth/a-first-look-at-cairo-1-0-a-safer-stronger-simpler-provable-programming-language-892ce4c07b38#6d64 array section, 
`impl ArrayU128Drop of Drop::<Array::<u128>>`, what is happening under the hood. how is it different from rust. the `impl for` syntax if now implementation used the default implementation within the `trait` definition. how to check the default `Drop<T>` ?","",""

2. This will be reworked soon in Starklings with the latest additions to the core library. But basically the external `print` function takes an array of felts and displays them.

3. `extern` means that it's not a ""pure"" cairo function, but high-level function that translates to a Sierra libfunc for which we can generate the correspondig CASM code
- array_append is implemented in the cairo compiler, `corelib/src/array.cairo`

4. `mut` variables are just syntaxic sugar. `ref` can only be applied to mutable variables, the eq in rust is `&mut ref`

5. This is for the ""garbage collection"" feature of Cairo1/Sierra that ensures that each variable is either consumed or dropped. I believe that this statement generates the code for the Drop behavior for this type.","",""

1„ÄÅIf you want to print more than one value - just split it into two prints.
3„ÄÅ`extern fn ... ` are functions that are implemented in the sierra level - these are provided as the final ""linkage level"" of the compiler.
4„ÄÅit is also similar to rust - where you cannot modify a non-`mut` var. we hope to expand resources on the subject soon.
5„ÄÅthe trait system is indeed `of `based instead of `for` based - a trait is not provided `for` a type - instead an `impl` is an implementation of a `trait` - when calling a `trait` method - we would find some` impl` matching it. `Copy` and `Drop` are special - they do not have an implementation - they just mark the type as a type that can be copied (having an additional ref to the same point in memory) or dropped (no longer referring to a value in memory, without any special action such as `dict_squash`)

"895328389299318866","eni7912","14/03/2023 7:09 pm","it's not what you should be thinking about when using snapshots

The reasoning should be, imo :
- Do I need to reuse this value later in the calling function context ? -> if not, pass by value
- Do I need to reuse this value later in the calling function context AND modify it in the called function ? -> pass by ref
- Do I need to reuse this value later in the calling function context without it being modified in the called function ? -> pass by snapshot

most likely in your example, you don't want to modify the struct and you might want to reuse it afterward, so in that case, you'd use a snapshot. It would be less efficient to use `ref` as you'd need to push more values to memory before returning from the function context","","üôè (3)"

```rust
use array::ArrayTrait;

#[derive(Drop)]
struct MyStruct {
    value: felt252,
    arr: Array<felt252>
}

fn main() {
    let mut my_struct = MyStruct { value: 0, arr: ArrayTrait::<felt252>::new() };
    pass_by_value(my_struct.value);
    my_struct.value = 10; //variable moved
}

fn pass_by_value(value: felt252) {}
```

`my_struct` is moved to `pass_by_value` but we only pass the `value` field as a parameter. We can't reuse `my_struct` later in the code because it was moved.

The only way around right now is to deconstruct-reconstruct the struct like this. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_struct = MyStruct { value: 0, arr: ArrayTrait::<felt252>::new() };
    let MyStruct{mut value, arr } = my_struct;
    pass_by_value(value);
    value = 10;
    my_struct = MyStruct { value, arr };

so my proposal is to implement `clone()` on core types, so that this becomes valid:
```rust
   let mut my_struct = MyStruct { value: 0, arr: ArrayTrait::<felt252>::new() };
    pass_by_value(my_struct.value.clone());
    my_struct.value = 10;

    return (a, b);

fn __foo(ref a: int, ref b: int, n: usize) {
    check_gas();

    // --- End of the recursion ---
    if n == 3_usize {

`arr1.span().snapshot.clone().print();`
here https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1/blob/52fb1415c83db2424ede43f0c43cfbc420dcdbdb/exercises/move_semantics/move_semantics1.cairo#L18. It works great.

But it doesn't seem to work now in cairo v1.0.0-alpha.6, like here:
```

use clone::Clone;

    let mut arr = ArrayTrait::<felt252>::new();
    arr.append(1);
    arr.span().snapshot.clone().print(); // causes error now
    arr.append(2);
}
```
This causes an error now:
```
Error: Failed setting up runner.
 Caused by:
        #15->#16: Got 'Unknown ap change' error while moving [7].
```
If I remove `arr.append(2);` line, the error changes a bit:
```
fn main() {
    let mut arr = ArrayTrait::<felt252>::new();
    arr.append(1);
    arr.span().snapshot.clone().print(); // causes different error now 
}
```

    value: u32, 
}

fn main() {
    let mut number = Number { value: 1111111_u32 };

    get_value(@number); 

    set_value(number);
}

// Should not take ownership and not modify the variable passed.
fn get_value(number: @Number) -> u32 {
    *(number.value)
}

// Should take ownership
fn set_value(mut number: Number) {
    let value = 2222222_u32;
    number = Number { value };
    number.value.print();
}```
 but I don't really understand why it's wrong to use 'ref' for ```get_value(ref number)```. 
2. Additionally, it seems if return``` (*number).value``` in the ```get_value(number: @Number)-> u32``` is wrong with error: Cannot desnap a non copyable type.  But when I consult ChatGPT for Rust usage of accessing fields with reference to a struct, it says I can simply the dot operator . directly without the need for explicit dereferencing using the * operator. Rust automatically dereferences the reference like 
```fn get_value(number: &Number) -> u32 {
    number.value // Rust handles the dereferencing automatically
}```
And If I still want to use explicit dereferencing, it should be like this:
```fn get_value(number: &Number) -> u32 {
    (*number).value // Dereference the reference using the * operator and then access the value field
}```
So I don't know why it's different with Cairo?","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

I scrapped the project last year, but have recently considered picking it back up. I want to research pros/cons of rebuilding in starknet. My understanding is that Starknet claims to offer cheap/fast transactions, but I'm looking for hard numbers to understand just how cheap/expensive compute is in comparison to Solana. 

I'd also like to understand other elements of comparison: are there features offered by one and not possible on the other?  Is generating a VRF easily accessible on Starknet (it's fairly difficult on Solana)? What about contract upgradeability and ability to have control over the project as it's launched?

Can I get some help.

I am having issues while declaring a interface of custom struct.

I have already declared the implementation.

so I am declaring this interface
```
    fn get_loan_records(loan_id: u128) -> Loan ;

```
and its giving me this error :
```
error: Trait has no implementation in context: core::serde::Serde::<zkOpen::open::storages::open_store::Loan>

However : 

writting a function in the same contract, eg:
```

fn get_loan(loan_id) ->  Loan {
   .........
}
```

works.

can someone help me on this.","",""

I am working on the `starklings-cairo1` exercise and I have encountered an issue. In the [cairo1 gitbook](https://cairo-book.github.io/ch02-02-data-types.html), it is mentioned that a syntax allows assignment to variables parsed from tuples, as shown in the following example:

```
fn main() {
    let tup: (x: felt252, y: felt252) = (2,3);
}
```

However, when I tried to use this syntax in my code as follows:

```cairo
fn main() {
    let cat : (name : felt252, age: felt252)= ('Furry McFurson', 3);
    name.print();
    age.print();
}
```

I received the following error messages:

```

"895328389299318866","eni7912","02/05/2023 1:59 pm","Hey, I'm using `cairo-test` to run some interop tests. I'm using OZ's ERC20 token standard with the following `_transfer` function:

```rust
    fn _transfer(sender: ContractAddress, recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256) {
        assert(!sender.is_zero(), 'ERC20: transfer from 0');
        assert(!recipient.is_zero(), 'ERC20: transfer to 0');
        _balances::write(sender, _balances::read(sender) - amount);
        _balances::write(recipient, _balances::read(recipient) + amount);
        Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    }
```

The problem is that I get an `ENTRYPOINT_FAILED` error when calling a function that calls `ERC20Dispatcher.transfer` that itself calls `_transfer`. It looks like removing the line
`_balances::write(sender, _balances::read(sender) - amount);` removes this error but then it just ain't the right logic anymore I can't figure out what's happening here.

I know you said it was bad practice and should be avoided. But I can't get rid of the `variable moved` error unless I do it this way. 

I understand why the error is happening here - call_context contains arrays, and doesn't implement copy. A workaround would be to add an implementation to the `ExecutionContext` type to only return snapshots of objects, that would probably solve it.

For an experimental project I am working on I need to save some amount of text in the storage of a cairo 1 smart contract. Let‚Äôs say about 200 ‚Äì 2k words. I wrote a small contract that has a function which accepts an Array<u8> and then stores each u8 as an element of a LegacyMap. It is super expensive, however. I think it is because of the many storage writes. Is there a better way to do it? Maybe using felts instead of u8 and also using felt as index of the LegacyMap?

the mapping itself probably has no reason to be mapped from u256 (it makes the access cost to pedersens instead of 1 that would have been for any other type.

In cairo0, I have a struct that contains a felt252 array, in which the element size is 248 bits and requires division to perform calculations on the array elements. I noticed that felt252 does not provide division support in cairo1. This means that I need to use u128 or u256 to organize data when migrating to cairo1. Since felt252 is the basic unit, this may mean that a lot of storage space needs to be filled with 0s to organize the data.

```
Error: Failed setting up runner.

Caused by:
    Failed calculating gas usage, it is likely a call for `gas::withdraw_gas` is missing.
```
I understand that gas needs to be dealt with for any loops, and I think that is taken care of here.

But if I comment out all 3 lines here 
https://github.com/whatthedev-eth/cubit/blob/fix-type-annotations/src/test/type_tests.cairo
OR, if I comment out all 4 lines here
https://github.com/whatthedev-eth/cubit/blob/fix-type-annotations/src/test/math_tests.cairo
then `cairo-test .` works fine in either case. So all the tests pass in one case or the other, but only if I don't run all tests at once. I can run only some of the tests at a time.

No idea why üòï . Any thoughts on how to get all the tests to run without commenting out some? Thx!!","",""

```

With this code:
```


#[contract]
mod Anchoring {

    use starknet::get_caller_address;
    use starknet::get_block_timestamp;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;


    // Storage variable used to store the anchored value
    struct Storage {
        whitelisted: ContractAddress, // The address of the whitelisted contract
        anchored_value: (felt252, u64) // hash, timestamp
    }

    // Function used to initialize the contract
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(_whitelisted: ContractAddress) {
        whitelisted::write(_whitelisted);
    }

}

I assume that since the tuple is in storage a read and a write functions need to be implemented into a new interface for the new type that my tuple is?

1. just add `--allowed-libfuncs-list-name experimental_v0.1.0`, after`starknet-compile`
2. trick the code compiler
if the minimal code like this

#[contract]
mod test {
    //////

    //////
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor() {

        assert(pass == cond, 'should success');
        assert(reject == cond, 'should panic');

the compiler will reject  `assert`, but if you code sth below, compiler will let you pass

mod test {

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor() {
        let reject = false;

for the value. I implemented the `read` and `write` functions for  StorageAccess already and can assert in the constructor that it is working as intended
```
struct Storage {
  map: LegacyMap<felt252, CustomStruct>,
}

#[constructor]
fn constructor() {
  let my_struct: CustomStruct = CustomStruct {
    value_a: 1_u64,
    value_b: 2_u64,
    value_c: 3_u64,
  };

  map::write(1, my_struct);

  let stored_struct = map::read(1);

  assert(stored_struct.value_a == 1_u64, 'not u64');
  assert(stored_struct.value_b == 2_u64, 'not u64');
  assert(stored_struct.value_c == 3_u64, 'not u64');
}
```
I'm now trying to write some tests for this and I hit a wall trying to convert back the result of a `call` to a view method into the CustomStruct so that I can make the same assertions in the test
```let result = call(contract_address, 'get_struct', @call_calldata).unwrap();```

A simple contract:
```
#[contract]
mod SimpleContract {
    struct Storage {
        contract_id: u256
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(id: u256) {

    }

    #[view]
    fn id() -> u256 {
        contract_id::read()
    }
}
```

A deployer for the simple contract:
```
use core::traits::TryInto;
#[contract]
mod TestDeploy {
    use starknet::ClassHash;
    use starknet::ContractAddress;
    use traits::TryInto;
    use result::ResultTrait;

    use array::ArrayTrait;
    use array::SpanTrait;
    use starknet::syscalls::deploy_syscall;
    use starknet::syscalls::SyscallResult;

    struct Storage {
        contract_class_hash: ClassHash,
        contract_addresses: LegacyMap::<u256, ContractAddress>,
        next_contract_id: u256

    }

    #[external]
    fn deploy_new_contract() {
        let new_id = next_contract_id::read();
        next_contract_id::write(new_id + 1_u256);

        let mut calldata = ArrayTrait::<felt252>::new();
        calldata.append(new_id.try_into().unwrap());
        calldata.append(0);

        let result = deploy_syscall(
            contract_class_hash::read(),
            new_id.try_into().unwrap(),
            calldata.span(),
            true
        );

        if result.is_ok() {
            let (new_contract_address, _) = result.unwrap();
            contract_addresses::write(new_id, new_contract_address);
        }
    }

    #[view]
    fn last_contract_deployed() -> u256 {
        let next_id = next_contract_id::read();
        assert(next_id > 0, 'NO_CONTRACT_DEPLOYED');
        next_id - 1_u256
    }

    #[view]
    fn contract_address(id: u256) -> ContractAddress {
        assert(id <= last_contract_deployed(), 'NOT_DEPLOYED');
        contract_addresses::read(id)
    }
}
```

To test the example:
1) Declare the SimpleContract contract.
2) Declare the TestDeploy contract.
3) Deploy the TestDeploy contract with the ClassHash of SimpleContract in the constructor arguments.
4) Invoke `deploy_new_contract()` to deploy a new SimpleContract, with an incremental id, starting from 0.
5) Check the new contract address with the `contract_address` view function, using the last deployed id (which can be obtained with the `last_contract_deployed` view function.","","üëç (2)"

Since upcast and downcast operations seem not to be supported by Starknet at the moment, is there any workaround? For example, i have the following code where i try to add an u8 to an u128. Compiled to Sierra using Scarb this gives me an upcast operation.

```
let byte_as_u256: u256 = u256 {
    high: 0_u128, low: (0_u128 + bytes.pop_front().unwrap().into())
};
```

When trying to deploy i get the following error:

```
Error: StarkException: (500, {'code': <StarknetErrorCode.COMPILATION_FAILED: 3>, 'message': ""Compilation failed.

This is a bit of a detailed question, so if anyone knows, please tell me.

I am reading a Medium document about Cairo 1.0 release.
It says, ""Implementing forced L1 transactions will be possible, allowing StarkNet to inherit the full censorship-resistance of Ethereum.""
Why is it possible to inherit the censorship system of Ethereum?
Conversely, why couldn't Cairo 0.x inherit it?

last week in order to try my multicall because I couldn't mock calls through protostar, but I can't find a way to provide inputs. 
I want to start with a single struct containing those values:

```

where 1, 33133781693 represents the array [ 33133781693 ], as this is supposed to be an array of calls, I tried to prefix it with the size, so:
```1, 0x003bab268e932d2cecd1946f100ae67ce3dff9fd234119ea2f6da57d16d29fce, 0x2e269d930f6d7ab92b15ce8ff9f5e63709391617e3465fff79ba6baf278ce60, 1,  33133781693

We have a unpacking function which does quite a few castings from 256 to u8 -> seen here https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/loot-survivor/blob/item-leveling/contracts/adventurer/src/item_meta.cairo#L158

We then use this function in our game contract here -> https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/loot-survivor/blob/item-leveling/contracts/game/src/game/game.cairo#L565

**Issues are:**
1. scarb build -> this works fine
2. scarb cairo-test -> this does not compile and gives the following error
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Failed to cast from 32913.', /cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/cairo-lang-utils-2.0.0-rc4/src/casts.rs:8:35
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
``` 
I can post the full trace next


**The weird part**
If i comment out one of the functions calling the unpack (so now its only being called once) it tests correctly.... -> https://github.com/BibliothecaDAO/loot-survivor/blob/item-leveling/contracts/game/src/game/game.cairo#L565

Here is the approach with a custom struct. Basically, you've to `impl` the `serde` trait for your struct, letting know to the compiler that the generic type `T` must also implements `serde`.

```rust
use array::{ArrayTrait, SpanTrait};
use serde::Serde;
use option::OptionTrait;

#[derive(Drop)]
struct MyStruct<T> {
    my_span: Span<T>
}

impl MyStructSerde<T, impl TSerde: Serde<T>, impl TDrop: Drop<T>> of Serde<MyStruct<T>> {
    fn serialize(self: @MyStruct<T>, ref output: Array<felt252>) {
        self.my_span.serialize(ref output);
        // serialize other fields...
    }

    fn deserialize(ref serialized: Span<felt252>) -> Option<MyStruct<T>> {
        let my_span: Span<T> = Serde::<Span<T>>::deserialize(ref serialized)?;

could anyone help me with a question? the code example for that section is the following:

```rs
use debug::PrintTrait;
#[derive(Copy, Drop)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u64,
    height: u64,
}

trait RectangleTrait {

    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50,  };

    rect1.area().print();
}
```

my question is, a `RectangleTrait` trait was created and there is an implementation called `RectangleImpl`, but in the `main` function it is using an instance of `Rectangle`, not of `RectangleImpl`, why? I mean, idk why that `impl RectangleImpl` name if it isn't used anywhere","",""

"895328389299318866","eni7912","21/07/2023 12:43 am","hey! Rectangle is the name of the data type. Traits in Cairo - and in our case RectangleTrait is just a collection of functions.
Implementations are linked to traits, because the behavior of the traits functions are defined in the implementation - but they are not linked to specific data structures.
You can have multiple implementations for a single trait, and you can have multiple functions taking different structs as `self` parameter!

An example would be
```rust
struct Person{}
struct Dog{}

trait MakeSound{
  fn talk(self: @Person);
  fn bark(self: @Dog);
}

// the name of the implementation doesn't matter a lot
impl SoundImpl of MakeSound{
  fn talk(self: @Person){
    //...
  }

  fn bark(self: @Dog){
    //...
  }
}

fn main(){
  let dog = Dog{};
  let person = Person{};

  person.talk();
  dog.bark();
}

```
In the example from the book, the `area` function takes a `self: @Rectangle` parameter. This makes it a method of the `Rectangle` data type, allowing us to call it as `rect.area()`, where `rect` is a variable of `Rectangle` type. 

In later examples, you will see 3 different ways of calling the same function: as a method of the type, directly from the implementation, and directly form the trait. The 3 of theme are equivalent.","","üëç (6),üáπüá∑ (1)"

You have to simulate a mutable array for this. You can't achieve this with the native array type. You would need to use a Dicitonary for that. 

See https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria/blob/main/src/data_structures/vec.cairo

Here we define a Vec data structure and its associated method that works like a mutable array","","üôè (1)"

1. Today, storage structs can be of size <= 256 felts
2. To simulate arrays, you can use index=>value mapping and another length storage variable (you can't put mappings in structs)
3. In general, storing arrays doesn't really make sense (every storage write would potentially be very expensive and perform a lot of writes under the hood). One can think of a syntax for arrays storage that only supports writing to specific indices, but we don't have that ATM.","","ü´° (1)"

e.g. this is not fine

```rust
    fn run(ref self: EVMInstructions, ref context: ExecutionContext) {
        // Decode and execute the current opcode.
        self.decode_and_execute(ref context);

But the following is fine

```rust
    fn run(ref self: EVMInstructions, ref context: ExecutionContext) {
        // Decode and execute the current opcode.
        self.decode_and_execute(ref context);

it has something to do with the fact that `context` is used when checking the boolean condition, and to overcome that I would have to explicitly copy it, with something i don't really like:

```rust
    fn run(ref self: EVMInstructions, ref context: ExecutionContext) {
        // Decode and execute the current opcode.
        self.decode_and_execute(ref context);
        // Check if the execution is complete.

1. You send a message to the starknet core contract on L1.
2. This message is gathered by the starknet sequencer, which in turn sends a specific transaction type `L1Handler` automatically to the contract address you mentioned in your message.
3. The sequencer sets itself the from_address based on the message emitted by starknet core on L1.

Do the owner become the address who calls the deploy ?

Here is my 2.1.0 code:
```rs
        fn hash_domain(self: @ContractState, domain: Span<felt252>) -> felt252 {
            if domain.len() == 0 {
                return 0;

            let hashed_domain = pedersen(x, y);
            return hashed_domain;
        }
```
It defines the hash a Span like [ a, b, c ] as pedersen(c, pedersen(b, pedersen(a, 0))). What would be the best way to do it with the new syntax?

 The naive upgrade would be:
```rs
        fn hash_domain(self: @ContractState, domain: Span<felt252>) -> felt252 {
            if domain.len() == 0 {
                return 0;
            }
            let new_len = domain.len() - 1;
            let x = *domain[new_len];
            let y = self.hash_domain(domain.slice(0, new_len));
            let hashed_domain = pedersen::pedersen(x, y);
            return hashed_domain;
        }

Allowing to read the storage of another contract would make the process of permissionlessly building on top much easier, and as upgradability would only be necessary for code actually writing to the storage, we would probably see more immutable contracts.
