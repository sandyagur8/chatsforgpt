From my understanding, Cairo works like TinyRAM. However, TinyRAM has a huge overhead and hasn't been used in practice. Is there any particular reason why Cairo is much better than TinyRAM? 
(1) Is that because the underlying ZKP system of Cairo is STARK? 
(2) Is that because Cairo requires continuous memory?  i.e. Programmer needs to code using continuous memory and thus Cairo can remove the permutation network inside the circuit.
(3) Is that because Cairo's AIR is much better than the instruction set in TinyRAM?

Another point of view: TinyRAM started from a ""standard"" instruction set (one that doesn't take into account the algebraic constraints of building AIRs) and built constraints around it. Cairo came after handcrafting AIRs and is  a ""just right"" choice of an AIR that's powerful and agile enough to write programs in but also efficient in the size of the traces (and STARK proofs) that arise from it.","",""

```
%builtins output range_check
from starkware.cairo.common.math import unsigned_div_rem

func pow(base : felt, exp : felt) -> (res):
    if exp == 0:
        return (res=1)
    end
    let (res) = pow(base=base, exp=exp - 1)
    return (res=res * base)
end


func main(output_ptr : felt*, range_check_ptr) -> (output_ptr : felt*, range_check_ptr):
    let(val) = pow(base=1099467804513644, exp=4)
    assert [output_ptr ] = val
    let (range_check_ptr, q, r) = unsigned_div_rem(range_check_ptr=range_check_ptr, value=val, div=1118387959276439)   
    assert [output_ptr+1] = q
    assert [output_ptr + 2] = r
    return (output_ptr=output_ptr + 3, range_check_ptr=range_check_ptr)

A quick question about something I'm not sure to understand : the interaction between cairo and a smartcontract.

Let's take the voting tutorial: 
1. I will collect the votes for the batch #1
2. I will send the votes to my Cairo program to get the vote counts + the previous merkleRoot and the new one
3. I will submit my program + inputs on the prover (via `cairo-sharp submit --source main.cairo --program_input votes_input.json`)
4. If valid, the prover will set my fact as valid and I will send the vote counts + the merkleroots to my smartcontract (to update the global state), as well as the fact, for the SC to check the validity of the run 
5. Tada my SC root is up to date with the actual vote status

But in fact, I could have send any voteCount, or any new merkleroot, or any program to verify.
How is the relation between my SC and my Cairo program built ?

The example talks about verifying 100 out of 150 signatures. What I am unclear about is how Ethereum knows that the correct set of signers signed on the block (assuming that list is not hardcoded in the Cairo code and can change on Ethereum). Is there a way for Ethereum smart contract to verify that? A naive approach: 
- Cairo code computes the hash of signer list (which is input to the code) and puts this as an output
- The Ethereum smart contract recomputes the hash and then matches it with programOutput. 
The problem with above approach is that Cairo uses Pedersen hash, which is expensive on Ethereum. Am I missing something?","",""

The simplest solution is to pass the 150 keys to the Cairo program. Passing information between Cairo and Ethereum is not that expensive.
If you want to improve it (assuming the list of public keys doesn't change much): then you'll use a Pedersen hash. To avoid computing it on Ethereum you'll use a second Cairo program (let's call it ""B"", and let's call the original program ""A"") to prove that ""The Pedersen hash of these specific 150 keys is x"" (so that both the 150 keys and x are in program B's output). Then you'll store x on the smart contract's storage and pass it to program A (the one based on the voting tutorial) when signature verification is needed.
When the list changes, you'll invoke program B again.","",""

So in fact we compute S + b0 * P + b1 * (2P) + b2 * (4P) + ... = S + xP instead of simply xP (where ...b2b1b0 is the binary representation of x). The difference between mimic_ec_mult_air() and ec_mult() is that  mimic_ec_mult_air() simulates exactly the same operations done by the AIR, so if for some reason we get the zero point along the computation, it'll raise an error.","",""

It says that the dict_ptr suppied to `dict_read` is wrong. While `dict_read` expected to get `5:3` the code passed `5:6`.
The problem is that you have the line `dict=dict + DictAccess.SIZE` at the end of `iterate_dict`.
It should simply be `dict=dict` as `dict_read` already takes care of advancing the pointer.

The difference is that all the values of a default dict always start from a default value. In order to initilize it, you simply call `dict_write()` (regular Cairo call, not a hint). At the end you finalize it using `default_dict_finalize`.
To call `default_dict_finalize`, pass (1) the pointer returned by default_dict_new (that is, the pointer before the changes), (2) the current pointer and (3) the same default value you passed to default_dict_new.
For example:
```
let (local my_dict_start) = default_dict_new(default_value=0)
# Create a different reference so that my_dict_start won't move.
let my_dict = my_dict_start
# The following line will change my_dict.
dict_read{dict_ptr=my_dict}(key=1234)
...
# Finalize the dict
default_dict_finalize(dict_accesses_start=my_dict_start, dict_accesses_end=my_dict, default_value=0)

I'm trying to think of how I would architect a system that could store assets on ipfs/filecoin but be access locked for only those that own the corresponding nft.

I know this would be pretty difficult to  keep a secret that no one could copy in nft metadata some how in ethereum main net..but I'm wondering.

Does this seem doable on starknet?","",""

it‚Äôs the secret that would have to be held by the nft and its use to decrypt the file pulled from ipfs/filecoin that I see as the crux of the issues proving that it‚Äôs valid and using it to decrypt without leaking the secret may require some dark magic. If it‚Äôs even possible to do it the way I‚Äôve envisioned.

If instead the asset is function of time - a live video stream of my living room for example - the value is with the stream, not with any particular frame. if this is the case, theoretically you can simply change the key to the asset (probably need to re-encrypt &/ re-upload the asset) every time *any* NFT changes hand, and at all times all NFT holders have access to the most recent & only valid key.

1. Run `starknet get_contract_addresses --network=alpha` to get `GpsStatementVerifier` (which is currently `0xAB43bA48c9edF4C2C4bB01237348D1D7B28ef168`)

3. Go to this contract and look in internal transaction for the contracts it's using, you should be able to locate `MemoryPageFactRegistry` by the `LogMemoryPageFactRegular` events (currently, `0xb609Eba1DC0298A984Fa8a34528966E997C5BB13`)","",""

1. What's the best practice regarding the usage of `%builtins pedersen` for example. If I have a file `foo.cairo` using stuff from `bar.cairo`, should the `%builtins` be used in the first file or the second file, or both?

The idea is that you create your pub/priv keypairs, deploy an account (single owner, or more fancy models like multisig / guardian like what Argent are doing). You prepare the transaction data and sign it, then you pass it to your account contract. The account contract checks the signature according to its particular scheme and the if everything is good it then calls the application. The application can then call `get_caller_address()`, which will now be your account contract! (which no one else can originate transactions from, because they don't control your key(s)).

While it's easy to deploy a discourse instance, Stack exchange is a bit longer, see https://area51.stackexchange.com/
Basically we need to gather support around our proposal for a starknet stack exchange, have it tested then launched and so on.
My feeling is that while Stack exchange is great and devs are used to it, we need something up fast in order to facilitate discussions. So I'd rather deploy something quickly. 
What do you think? Do you have opinions on platforms you'd like to use?","","üíØ (2)"

There is no difference between the two cases from an on-chain data perspective, both will add 3 new pairs of (address, value) to the state diff. There is a difference in terms of the addresses, the account in scenario B is spread accross 3 random addresses, while the account in scenario B is actually spread across 3 consecutive addresses (the addresses for structs are computed differently). This means that if you plan to access them together, scenario A makes more sense (in the state update proof, each storage access is accompanied by a Merkle path, if the addresses are close you will basically need one path + a little overhead to access all the elements of the account).","","üëç (2),üôè (1)"

The game stores a random number that each player adds some randomness to. 

A user has some input that they could grind to modify the random number, but that this would change their turn action, which hampers the ability to grind the pseudorandom number.

The random number is added to at the start of a players turn and then at multiple other points in the turn they can then draw from the number. Each time a number is drawn, it progresses the generator and saves it.

This field does not imply any particular scheme (thus not hurting abstraction), and is used to pass an array of ""signature related"" fields. 

The motivation for separating this for the arguments is making the transaction hash independent of the signature. This allows supporting malleable signatures schemes, where you can e.g. take a signed message (m,s) and create a different valid signature on the same message (m,s'). If the signature was part of the hash, then you could create an equivalent transaction with the same hash, which is probably undesirable.

As this field is not mandatory, it will be minimized and only expanded if the user wants to provide it (already on Voyager dev).","","üôè (2)"

You could make a `paygas` syscall function that must be called within a certain number of steps into the program. The `paygas` function could have the funds to pay the gas itself, or it could fetch the gas from some other contract before paygas is called. In this way you could preserve the potential for gasless native meta transactions. 

If the account can check the signature and muster gas within that step-limit, then the prover proceeds with the rest of the program. 

Something like breaking a contract into two halves from the provers perspective:

1. Send transaction with signature
2. Contract checks signature
3. Contract prepares funds for gas (e.g., making an authorised call to some fund-containing contract, potentially with a claim or token exchange)
4. Contract calls `paygas` syscall
5. Prover runs the program up until this point and can, if need, receive the payment even if the rest of the transaction code fails (e.g., failed assertion)
6. Rest of the program is run.

The prover has the guarantee that the second half is compilable, but I guess the contract needs to be broken into two separate programs so that the prover can just run the first half to collect gas in the event that the contract runs into a failed assertion (and cannot be proven). But in order to prevent the prover from only running the first half they need to be coupled somehow... so probably this is a hair-brained scheme.","",""

If you use the IERC20 interface in a contract, the compiler will throw an error if you don't use a `felt` in the function calls, but the ERC20 contract will throw an error because your calldata is not the correct size if you use `felt` (Uint256 underlying data structure uses 2 felts)","",""

"708301655984046090","Khachatur#0705","18/11/2021 9:26 pm","Hey there folks! I have one question regarding the cairo compiler API endpoint and using starknet JS

So here is the issue: I am compiling cairo contract with this API endpoint: `https://2uuf49xjkk.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod/cairo` 

Which in return gives me the contract definition, which then I want to deploy to starknet with the default API endpoint which is also used inside the StarknetJS library: 
`https://alpha3.starknet.io/gateway/add_transaction` 

But when I use `deployContract` from StarknetJS is throws an error of invalid program, but when I do manual POST to the above `add_transaction` endpoint it works.

What I assume is that the `/prod/cairo` endpoint returns already Gzipped program, which then `deployContract` gzippes again and later `add_transaction` endpoint fails to `uncompress` the given program. 

I want to understand whether this is better to be solved inside the StarknetJS not to gzip before deploying, but my gut feeling tells me that StarknetJS is sort of ""securing"" the content which is being deployed. So I assume that possibly the `prod/cairo` endpoint should not the gzipping. Any insight or help is much appreciated üôÇ

When a contract is compiled for distribution it is probably better to use --debug_info_with_source.

@external
func test{
    syscall_ptr : felt*,
    pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*,
    range_check_ptr
    }(a : felt) -> (price : felt):
    let (price) = a
    return (price)
end
```
When you attempt to compile this, it says it cannot unpack `a`.

```
@external
func test{
    syscall_ptr : felt*,
    pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*,
    range_check_ptr
    }(a : felt) -> (price : felt):
    return (price=a)
end
```
This works fine.","",""

I sent the param as string but it did not work:

```
const msgHash = encode.addHexPrefix(

      tokenAddress,
      stark.getSelectorFromName(""approve""),

  const { r, s } = ec.sign(adminKeyPair, msgHash);

I'm following the official tutorial https://starknet.io/docs/hello_starknet/cli.html#get-storage-at

After calling 

```
starknet get_storage_at \
    --contract_address CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    --key 916907772491729262376534102982219947830828984996257231353398618781993312401

i get this result 

```
0x4d2
```

At this point I have to trust, that the Starknet API is not lying to me. 

Is it possible to verify that this is in fact is true using the `stateRoot` on L1 (https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xde29d060d45901fb19ed6c6e959eb22d8626708e#readProxyContract)?

yes. so essentially, in theory, my business logic would be separate from any actual token contracts and be specific to some particular constraints about owning and sending NFTs. This logic lives on L2. But i need to be backward compatible with pre-existing token contracts on L1...
so imagine a user with a variety of tokens on layer1 uses my service: i create a L2 account for them that will conform to my specific business logic and then L2 versions of their tokens are deposited to their L2 account... but lets say one of those tokens is a game item from a pre-existing game on L1. If they want to go use the token in the game but the game doesn't know anything about my L2 logic, how does the user prove to the game's dapp that they own the token in question since presumably the dapp doesn't know how to interact with the L2 account and is checking for ownership of the L1 token; which is sitting in a bridge contract that can't sign a message...","",""

> Short-strings are max 31 chars, so is that the current limitation for messages? 
In StarkNet, everything is represented as an int - or more specifically, a felt (field element). Short strings are the limitation for *strings*, and it is related to the capacity to store data in a felt. A felt max value is 2**251 
However, a message is an array of felts. So you can send larger strings, as long as you slice them to fit into felts, in order to fit them into an array of felts.
I didn't want to spend too much time on this, which is why my system only display a simple string üôÇ 
> Is short-string indeed the correct encoding for strings? 
yes
> Do you expect some standards to be proposed for encoding strings and making these strings visible in dapps/wallets/explorers?
Not that I am aware of at the protocol level; but if your wallet has the code of the contract, he could probably infere the nature of the data to display it correctly.
>  Let me know if you have any resources you can share. If I understand correctly I can  safely store anything up to 251 bits in a felt datatype,  should I feel free to use utf-8 when encoding data in my own project? 
I guess so!","","üôè (1)"

I'm wondering when we say that we want to prove that this polynomial has low degree do we mean that the degree is less than the sum of the degrees of our boundary conditions? Or is there some other way to know how low the degree should be? 
In the first example given here https://medium.com/starkware/arithmetization-ii-403c3b3f4355, Boolean Execution Trace, would the degree of that polynomial need to be 0 since there are no boundary constraints?","",""

If you care about calldata costs, then roughly every cell update is 1k gas (you post the storage address and the new value, each 32 byte which is 512 gas since 1 byte = 16 gas). In the coming days we will publish a formula for fee calculation, which reflects the l1 signature (coming from storage updates and messages), and in the coming weeks we will have an api for estimating the fee (in the alpha version) for a given transaction.

If you want some aggregates, then I can suggest executing the above code to obtain the amount of calldata, and using the get_block api to see how many transactions were included (transaction receipts which appear on get block also return the # of steps, so you would be able to factor in l2 costs as well, once the formula is published).","",""

"866704318060560404","FeedTheFed | StarkWare#8826","05/01/2022 3:38 am","In the previous Eth2 sharding proposal you have the beacon chain + N shards. The timeline is devided into slots, in each slot a shard block can be proposed for every shard. Each shard has a comitte of validators, responssible for voting on accepting the block if the data corresponding to its header is available to the network (it does so by randomly sampling parts of the block). The execution environment (where regular EVM txs are sent, IIUC these are beacon blocks) only has access to the headers of the shard blocks. The idea for rollups under this design is to send data to some shard, and have the rollup contract access it only via the header. Since shards blocks are independent from beacon blocks, you will have to wait for the shard data to be included, and track the shard untill the data is there. Only then you can call your rollup contract and say ""look at the header of block x in shard y, make sure that the data corresponding to this header is indeed to one expected to be published"".

In the new design, there is only one global comittee rather than per shard, and the shard blocks are accepted alongside beacon blocks. This means that a tx would have regular calldata + data blob for a shard. In this simpler design you could send that data alongside the the rollup state update, saving you the need to look in past shard blocks (this is the l1-l2 synchronicity mentioned there). Note that the benefit to the rollup is not immediate, e.g. we send the calldata prior to state updates as part of our architecture, though if you imagine a bigger change involving utilizing shards this may be useful.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (4),üôè (1)"

For example, if I have a repeating constraint that says x_i is non zero, we can introduce a new ""virtual column"" of y_i's with the additional constraints x_i*y_i=1.

The simpler example for a computation trace is a Turing machine running in space-time (T,S). We can represent its computation as a T*S table, where rows are steps and columns are tape cells. In this example, the role of the columns is clear. In our case, we have many cells with different roles (there are the registers pc/ap/fp), memory cells, and auxiliary variables used for expressing the constraints more easily (e.g. the y_i's in the above example). Having a full row for each computation step (as in the TM trace example) is too expensive, resulting in a huge waste. This is why cells are divided into semantic roles and are spread across the table in a way that attempts to minimize the size of the table and avoid unused cells.","",""

So the context is the game of life deployed on goerli [1] - a 32x32 grid where each row is stored as a felt. The function called evolves the game by one step and staves the new state to storage [2]. So every cell in a row is packed using bitwise operations [3]. So every cell is read from storage, then saved, bringing the order to 32 x 32 x 2 = 2048, which matches that seen in the error [4]. 

Evolving the game for the first 31 generations did not cause a bitwise-related error. Now that the goerli deplyment has reached generation 32 the error appears. There is possibly some error in my code because it seems coincidental that 32 is also the game dimensions (but I haven't identified such a cause). The tx error suggests that 2048 is too large a number for bitwise total count, but generations 0-31 must have been permitted with 2048. 

Just putting out feelers in case anyone has a clue

What's the difference between StarkEx and StarkNet?
StarkEx is a standalone system for exchanges that uses the STARK proof system in order to provide scalability for the exchanges using it. See above for a list of exchanges already using StarkEx in production on Ethereum mainnet.
See https://starkware.co/product/starkex/

StarkNet is a general-purpose system, where you can write and deploy your own contracts, interact with other contracts, and so on, just like Ethereum.

I am not sure I understand your question so let me know if you need more info üôÇ
You can deposit ERC20 assets in StarkNet in one of 2 ways:
- You use the StarkNet canonical bridge
- You use a dedicated/ custom bridge 
In both cases, what is used is the l1/l2 messaging bridge https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/l1l2.html
In the first case, we implemented a L1 smart contract that holds the deposited funds; and that credits the funds on L2 once he receives something. It can do the opposite leg of the way, too
In the second case, this implementation is left to whoever wants to do it! Maker is doing their own bridge for DAI. You can implement yours too üôÇ . In this case, the L1 assets can be held by any kind of SC(s) you'd like
One of the interesting rabbit hole this opens is defi pooling. You could have, for example, a USDC bridge to StarkNet, that deposits the USDCs in AAVE on L1 while they are on L2; and simply emits aUSDC IOUs on StarkNet","",""

I'm passing an ethereum address in as an input to a function that just writes to a map with an index. The nile node seems to expect an array of int strings like so:
`[""5"", ""0x062cdb5f547735b352813397a5d2621c950cd98c6ac606d6d8898b11d7bd7e96""]`

When I pass in the entire address and call a write (e.g. `dungeon_owner.write(token_id, address)`), the invoke succeeds but a call to read the address at that index, it returns `0x0`.

If I reduce the length of the address to something like `0x62c`, the read returns that value.

I've found that the max lengths something around the lines of: ` 0x62cdb5f547735b352813397a5d2621c9` after which it returns `0x0`.

- right now it's probably just querying the ERC20 contract (you can find addresses here https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-addresses/blob/master/Bridged%20Token%20Addresses/Goerli.json and use Voyager or the API directly, note that testnet is upgraded to the next version as we speak so might be unstable in the next couple of hours)

Yes, implementation address is where the code you want executed resides.
If you want to initialize your contract at deployment, you should use the constructor yes. ""Initializer"" are (usually) internal functions that are called inside of constructors. The cool things with initializers is they can be inherited (constructors can not)","",""

Also it would only vary per L2 block, not from transaction to transaction.

During the transaction execution, system calls (including storage read/writes) are not verified but are just ""collected"". After the execution, we loop over the syscalls and start verifying the responses, so at this point in the code, we already know all the storage keys that were read from/written to. 

The global_state_changes is a dictionary where the keys are contract addresses and the values are pointers to StateEntry objects. Each StateEntry entry contains the contract hash and a pointer to the (end of) a dictionary. A single contract's dictionary is appended to in each read/write as seen in the link above (we create a new StateEntry object where the dictionary pointer gets another entry, when we have reads it's just an entry with prev_value=new_value).

Eventually this dict global_changes dict is squashed and we end up with unique keys, and for each unique contract address (with storage changes) we have a dictionary of changes. This is the update per contract

another thing I found to speed up runs is to use `invoke` instead of `call` when calling contract functions - the latter does a deep copy of the contract state, which is expensive (caveat - depending on the use case, sometimes you might want to use `call`, but from personal experience, most often you do actually want `invoke`)","","üëç (2)"

1. User calls storage read/write in his contract

2. An operation is written into the global dict, under the contract address key (we concatenate to the pointer that appears under global_dict[contract_address]). While applying the system call, there is no verification (this is a common pattern for our system calls), the values are obtained from hints and the Cairo only sees dict updates.

3. After all the execution of the block is done, system calls are verified and the relevant dicts are squashed.  Reads are logs with prev_value = new_value, updates are logs with prev_value != new_value, but at this point, since all operations were done through hints with no verifcation, it is possible that the operations are not consistent. An example would be the following sequence of (key,prev,new) updates: (1,0,1),(2,0,2),(1,1,2),(1,3,3), the last operation is wrong since the previous value of key=1 is 2 at this point. Squashing handles this and verifies consistency. In the context of storage variable, this makes sure that if you update a key to some value, and then read the storage variable, the new read will return the updated value.

4. This squashed dict goes to patricia_update. This will only succeed if for all keys, prev_val matches the value in the patricia_tree whose root we're starting with.","","üôè (2)"

I know how to call the function of another contract using the interface, address, selector and specific parameters.
So something like this:
`IContract.function(contractAddress, argument1, argument2, argument3)`.
Is it possible to encode the selector and arguments, so that I can do something similar to this:
`ContractAddress.(Payload)`

I'm developing an app which require to create a starknet account for each new user who sign up. Given that a Starknet account is a contract deployed, I have 2 questions:

- Once fees will be implemented, will I have to pay for each new user who create an account on my app, or account deployment will be free?
- Right after the sign up, if the user wants to interact with my app in a way that require to sign a transaction, I will have to block him until the deployment is complete. How do you see the evolution of the account deployment duration?","",""
"866704318060560404","FeedTheFed | StarkWare#8826","15/02/2022 3:57 am","These issues are in discussion, I can offer some thoughts so far. Contract deployment has some additional burden on the network, so it makes sense it will involve a fee. However, there might be workarounds so that this fee is only paid upon the first ""actual"" transaction. 

Since the contract address is determined (roughly) from the contract hash and constructor arguments, a user with a random public key (or whichever arguments this account constructor expects) can know his SN address before deployment. As such, you can transfer funds to this address before actually deploying the contract (the balance will be written in the relevant ERC20). It can now be possible to allow another party to do the deployment and get compensated from the balance of the contract once it's deployed. Moreover, you can have a tx to your app contract that deploys the account and then (in the same tx) do some operation (so there's no blocking).

This is just an idea (with the fine details not yet polished), feel free to suggest improvements üôÇ Note that the above relies on our ability to deploy contracts from another contract (factory pattern), which SN does not yet have.","","üî• (3)"

My issue about the deployment duration doesn't fit any of your solutions. Actually, it's an app where the user can buy an ERC-1155 token after signing up (no problem for this part except that I can't use `safeTransfer` if the account is not deployed yet, but it's not a big deal), and then burn this ERC-1155 to receive some other ERC-1155 tokens. This part is more tricky, cause I need to sign the transaction with the user's account, and since the user is not forced to perform these operations, I can't do it in the same tx.

I'll let you know if I find a solution that suits my problem better than blocking the user until his account is deployed","",""

"866704318060560404","FeedTheFed | StarkWare#8826","21/02/2022 8:34 pm","Intro:
A block may be reverted/aborted, this refers to failure on L1 (reverts) and failure somewhere in L2 correspondingly. A tx can be rejected (the only ""bad"" status), this status is relative to a block (I'm rejected in a given block, you can see those in get_block queries). This means that if a tx was rejected in a block that was reverted/aborted, it will go back to received status.

1. Yes, due to reorgs on L1 or some failure on the l2 pipeline (no proof for some reason)
2. As tasi mentioned, finality is up to l1 reorgs. A rejected tx is part of the L2 block, and if that block is reverted then our sequencer will try to rerun it
3. I don't think there's something in the normal flow that leads to the pending block failing, so I would say no to the second (up to any unexpected error). Note that it's in an earlier stage in the pipeline though.
4. The sequencer ran the tx successfuly and updated its internal intermediary state, the updates will be applied to the state from the previous block only after the block is finalized.
5.  Should not happen
6. See above

I have a couple questions regarding standards and function signatures: 
(1) Could anyone give me pointers on how does Cairo compute function signatures? On ethereum, we know that it is something like `keccak256(""functionName(uint256,address,..)`. How about Cairo? Does implicit arguments count? Is everything in felt & pointers? 

(2) As we have ERC20 standards on Ethereum (basically a set of defined function signatures and their expected behaviours.), how does it work on Cairo? I guess we could argue that `function trasnferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)` is the same as `func transferFrom(felt from, felt to, felt amount`. However the function signature would be clearly different, right?  (Related to this, I'm also curious of how the transpiler from solidity to cairo would work here)

(3) Speaking of mapping fro solidity to cairo, with the above example, it means that it is possible for functions that are actually different in EVM to be mapped into the same function signature in Cairo. e.g. `xxx(uint256,address)` and `xxx(uint256,uint256)`. Is my understanding correct?

Thank you! üôå","",""

https://perama-v.github.io/cairo/account-abstraction/
https://community.starknet.io/t/fees-in-starknet-alpha/286/7

I'll try to raise some examples, to see if each of them is right. Please correct me!

1.
Unlike Ethereum, there's no need to sign/init every transactions with your account(from human); Some business logic can be integrated into your account contract thus more can be done, or the dapps flow can be written in a more elegant way.

2. 
But also unlike Ethereum, the account's ""not there initially"" (available account space, as it's generated by BIP32 it's legal and accepted by cliens/nodes); it has to be deployed onto starknet before it can start signing transactions.

But apparently acts of deploy contracts must pay fees, or we'll have data bloating problems. (correct me especially if this sentence is wrong, please)

Wouldn't this cause a entrance barrier for new users? 

3. (cont'd from 2)
Without EIP 2938, there's issues like when using mixers(tornado cash). one cannot use a fresh new account on ethereum, cause there's 0 eth inside hence no fees can be used to init transactions. This cause entrance barrier. The use of relayers also cause some deanonymization problems.

But for Starkware's account as contract structure, I wonder how the deployment fee will be covered (in the future, not saying they should always be subsidized), in order to solve this problem.

Or I got something wrong fundamentally...

The pre deposit idea is especially interesting - the only * issue * I can think of at the moment is just that, for a totally newb user, the generation of p/s key pair is usually done and provided by the frontend apps devs providing. (So that the devs know the generated public key beforehand, thus can predeposit even before contract deployment)

Which means if there's some holes, whether intentional or not intentional (e.g., ps4 fixed nonce), it's not good.

Guess it's getting polished and standardized (like from argentx/metamask, apis for 3rd party apps to implement the above-mentioned predeposit feature, etc)

"901886792612077578","starjam#9720","24/02/2022 6:01 pm","Hi.  I posted a question on cairo-lang-support but perhaps dev-support is better?  I'm taking the liberty of cross-linking:
https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838987128843/946274456282742805
My question is:

I'm trying to create a datum of variable felt length in Cairo, then set its value in a hint, for subsequent Cairo verification.  

Suppose for argument's sake that the function should create a list of n felts in Cairo memory, populated (using a hint) with values of some function `complicated_function`.  Here it is in code:

```
func create_list(n : felt):
   alloc_locals
   local my_list_ptr = alloc()
   %{ hint_to_populate_my_list %}
end
```

By my understanding, `my_list_ptr` points to a new memory segment allocated by `alloc()`.  So from within the Python hint I should compute 

`my_list = complicated_function(n) : List[int]` 

and then (from within the hint) set the segment pointed to by `ids.my_list` to the list value `my_list`.  I can then exit the hint and verify the value which has nondeterministically appeared at `my_list_ptr`.

How should I set a segment to a list value from within a Python hint?  I would be very grateful for guidance.  Thanks in advance.","",""

I made this small program: 
```
%builtins output

from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word
from starkware.cairo.common.alloc import alloc

struct MyStruct:
    member first_member: felt
    member second_member: felt

    [ap] = struct_array[1].second_member
    [ap] = [output_ptr + 1]; ap++
    [ap] = output_ptr + 2; ap++
    ret
end
```

This simply create one struct array, declare some values for it and write them on the output. What I understood from your above statement is that one struct of size=2 in an array will take 2 memory cells in this array. So the first element would be accessible via `struct_array[0].first_member` because it is at index 0, and the second element would be at `struct_array[1].second_member`. It turns out it is not the case and `second_member` is accessible at index 0 as well (like in any programming language i guess).

To go back to my first question, I thought we used `Location.SIZE` to bypass the second struct value and go directly to a new struct.

If so, I'm not sure what you're trying to do in the above. Think of a DictAccess array as an array of logs, each log documents a read/write operation. For example,(key=1,prev=0,new=0),(key=2,prev=1,new=1),(key=1,prev=0,new=2) represents the dictionary {1: 2, 2: 1}. The idea here is to add another log for each member in the key values list, where prev is the sum for this key so far and new is the new sum.

If I understand correctly, there should be a way to reset cancellation request time of a message? i.e., resetting `l1ToL2MessageCancellations()[msgHash]`
https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/4e233516f52477ad158bc81a86ec2760471c1b65/src/starkware/starknet/eth/StarknetMessaging.sol#L158-L159

Otherwise for the same `msgHash`, the cancellation only has to be requested and cancelled once and all future cancellation can happens immediately.

It might be used maliciously to cancel other user's or dapp's message by sending-and-cancelling message in advance (perhaps by predicting possible/popular message params `(toAddress, selector, payload, nonce)` etc.

And if the message can be instantly cancelled, it would become an DoS attacking surface.","",""

This is indeed a deliberate breaking change (which we should've mentioned explicitly in the release notes, but missed it). The output of the API changed from int to hex to enable JS libraries to work with the object more smoothly (and the max_fee field was added). We can't do this change in a backward compatible way (unless we add versioning to the API, which is not ideal at this alpha stage of the project), so after all it does mean **libraries should be changed accordingly**.

Note that we still haven't changed the signature field to work with hex, and we plan to do it in 0.8.1 - **so this will be another breaking change**

typically developed in a two-step process. First, an information-theoretically secure protocol, such as an
IP, multi-prover interactive proof (MIP), or probabilistically checkable proof (PCP), is developed for a
model involving one or more provers that are assumed to behave in some restricted manner (e.g., in a MIP,
the provers are assumed not to send information to each other about the challenges they receive from the
verifier). Second, the information-theoretically secure protocol is combined with cryptography to ‚Äúforce"" a (single) prover to behave in the restricted manner, thereby yielding an argument system. This second
step also often endows the resulting argument system with important properties, such as zero-knowledge,
succinctness, and non-interactivity. If the resulting argument satisfies all of these properties, then it is in fact

V1 is written in Python and is possible to get working on M1 however you have to install and run some things using `arch -x86_64` prefix. Before I go into details on getting that to work, the Warp team are working of V2 which is written in TypeScript and is a lot simpler to get running on M1. Check out the warp-ts branch in their git repo and look at the readme. From the top of my head it's as simple as installing yarn and solc via brew and running their yarn install script to compile the latest version of Warp.

Deploying starknet node now and found weird thing 

I got response from `starknet_syncing` : 

```

    ""current_block"": ""0xf6e914fb65b469e57a2799adcd91425d2379685e3b902ab08788f82d5f8013"",

  },
  ""id"": 0
}
```

but from docs (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/master/api/starknet_api_openrpc.json) im expecting `false` if node is synced. 
so there is a question: 

1) does node really synced up if current_block hash equals highest_block hash ? or it is not ? 
2) maybe there is a bug in endpoint ?

For instance, what if we have an account contract that implements IAccount interface as well as IERC721 interface - then we could issue an NFT to the public key initialising the account contract and is_valid_signature could check whether the signing public key is the owner of the said NFT which was minted on initialization. This could turn an account into a more general blockchain primitive where account ownership could be transferred independent of the wallet perhaps - and also transfer of ownership of an account could become as simple as transferring the NFT (transferring ownership could also be accomplished by simply changing the stored public key in the account contract but just trying to understand whether this is feasible). Is this right ? or have I misunderstood this concept (i have asusmed public key and contract address are indistinguishable at a protocol level and this scenario would not hold if thats not so)","",""

1. You call approve on contract A like that `approve(spender=contract_B, amount=whatever_amount)`
2. then when you call the staking contract to stake the tokens it'll have a line like that `IERC20.transferFrom(contract_address=contract_A, sender=your_address, recipient=contract_B, amount=whatever_amount)`
(transferFrom will check that you approved at least the amount of tokens contract B wants to move)
This is useful because it's the only way for the contract to know that the tokens were really transfered.

Now on Argent X for example when you want to send some tokens to Alice it'll call the `transfer` function like that `transfer(recipient=Alice, amount=whatever_amount)` and the transfer function will get the caller address (yours) and just check that you have enough balance to perform this transfer","",""

@external
func add{syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(amount : Uint256):
    let (user) = get_caller_address()
    let (contract) = get_contract_address()

    IERC20.transferFrom(token_contract, contract, user, amount)
    return ()
end
```

As you explained me, I approved my contract to spend some of my tokens before calling the add function: this worked (I could see on voyager the balance increased). Unfortunately I couldn't use the spend feature. Do you know what I could have done wrong?

- If I deploy my Cairo code as a smart contract, then inputs for the external functions are public i.e. none of the inputs can be set to be secret (This was demonstrated in the starknet-101 exercises by Henri)
- If I want to have private information as part of my system, I'd have to submit my own traces generated using `cairo-sharp` to SHARP (as demonstrated in Cairo playground)
  - SHARP has access to the secret information as it is given the inputs however when it generates the Proof, the Proof DOES NOT contain the secret information (?)
  - The verifier which is a contract on L1 produces and registers a fact without access to the secret information. This means etherscan cannot be used to see what the private information was as the proof didn't contain it. Further to this, the proofs were batched up as a 'train' so extracting the inputs for a particular program is extremely difficult but not impossible
- If I wanted to make a peer to peer dApp that proved something without revealing some secret knowledge I'd have to somehow generate traces in Javascript. I'm unsure if there is a way of doing that yet seeing as `cairo-sharp` is a python program.

So my questions:
- Is there a way to generate and submit a trace entirely in a web frontend without having to implement a server component?
- How do I choose which inputs should be secret? Is that what Cairo hints are for?
  - Looking at how hints work in the documentation, I believe my secret can be in my input.json file and I reference that data from within a hint. Is that input.json data revealed publicly?
- Is there a way of checking if a fact is valid from within a Cairo contract?
- Because I'm submitting my own traces, Voyager cannot be used to see my secret data?","",""

- Is there a way to generate and submit a trace entirely in a web frontend without having to implement a server component?
  - Seems like the cairo-sharp python program is required however I'm not sure if a JS version of this exists at all.
- Is there a way of checking if a fact is valid from within a L2 Cairo contract?
  - So far I've only found a way of calling isValid(fact) directly on the L1 verifier contract. 

I've gone down a rabbit hole with the idea of secret data that is provable. I've seen how this can be done by writing Cairo programs that consume secret data via hints, producing a proof via SHARP and checking the fact registry. To try and incorporate this with L2 contracts has become a little tricky so I also wanted to check if there isn't a simple way of having secret data natively with Starknet L2 contracts?","","üî• (1)"

It references a contract (0x49d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7) which I assume is used to implement the fee mechanism on the network, but I'm not sure what could be causing the error.

The tx is only around 20k steps so don't think it's related that.

It's my opinion that a solidity transpiler should be a first class citizen (e.g. starkware should be supporting/developing this with lots of resources). Cairo is a pretty different language than what most devs are used to, and it's hard to see it taking off, especially with the documentation/tutorials being very thin.

However, I maybe disagree a bit about the Solidity transpiler. Even if there was a transpiler with which you can get 100% accurate Cairo code, it wouldn't be what is needed. StarkNet has quite different capabilities compared to EVM, and reusing the same code in StarkNet doesn't often make sense. For example computation is very cheap in StarkNet.

"810700810190848012","calabashsquash","03/05/2022 9:38 am","From a L1 perspective, the function signature is a 4 byte identifier for identifying a specific function (see: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.24/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties).

From my experience so far, it seems like function signatures are much larger than 4bytes in StarkNet though. (see: https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet/blob/develop/contracts/ArgentAccount.cairo#L30-L36)

> how/when should it be used?
You can use it in any situation where you want to check what function is wanting to be called. For example, the ArgentX account contract checks to see if the user wants to execute one of 4 specific functions - and then does different signature verification depending on which one. See: https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet/blob/develop/contracts/ArgentAccount.cairo#L203-L204

I think that signature is the one that is signed by the user (i.e. the one that is used by an account contract to validate e.g.: https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts-starknet/blob/develop/contracts/ArgentAccount.cairo#L221-L222 )

4. Bob validates whether the Account with wallet_address has signed the nonce.

As for the hash algorithm, I used
`from starkware.cairo.lang.vm.crypto import pedersen_hash`

Is this the correct hash function?

If yes, for a singleton message to be hashed, do I call it with the integer message as second argument?
`hashed_message = pedersen_hash(0, message)`

Argent-X signs a JSON with this format:
```

    ""name"": ""Example DApp"",

> Note that while honest Sequencers automatically consume L1 -> L2 messages, it is not enforced by the protocol (so a Sequencer may choose to skip a message). This should be taken into account when designing the message protocol between the two contracts.

What is the recommendation on handling this lossy message channel? Is it possible for L1 contract to figure out if a message has been delivered to L2 or not? Otherwise, this seems very risky for things like deposits/withdraws, where deposit in L1 does not mean balance increase in L2.","","üëç (1)"

Following up on the above message - I want to build a protocol which is very modular so it can be composed with any fungible token-like asset. Naturally if there will only ever be ERC20s on starknet then I can handle this one way, but if there‚Äôs a high likelihood of native coin style assets being introduced (like ETH on Ethereum or NEAR on Near) then it has pretty serious design implications.

"439469696434044948","xenoliss","26/05/2022 4:00 pm","Hello there ! Still learning about Starknet and Cairo and all that good stuff. I understand that Cairo is a programming language used to build STARK proof and that Starknet is a sort of OS built in Cairo that can execute arbitrary programs and proof their correct execution  (and this is mindblowing tbh).

Previously there was StarkEx with the SHARP that, as far as I understood, allowed people to register arbitrary cairo programs, run them, obtain a proof of the valid execution and then on the L1 smart contracts one could reconstruct the ""Fact"" and query the Verifier onchain if the fact `isValid`. My first question is: **is StarkEx now (that we have Starknet) obsolete ? **, meaning that as a dApp developer do I have any incentive to use StarkEx instead of StarkNet ?

Now regarding StarkNet, I understand that it is a L2 solution that mostly brings (in addition to all the go STARK stuff that comes with cairo programs) the benefit of being able to have ""state"" when executing cairo programs (at cost of some features like hints not being available anymore). One can now interact with cairo smart contracts, deployed on Starknet in a similar fashion as what we are use to with other more traditional L2s. My 2nd question is: if I send a tx on starknet targeting my own starknet smart contract, **will it automagically  generate a proof that I can then verify on L1 using the Verifier smart contract ** (in a similar fashion that when using StarkEx) ?

Thanks a lot for the answers üôÇ","",""

But in general your keypair is used to authenticate you to the account contract. The account contract has a contract address. The account contract calls other contracts, and therefore the caller address is those other contracts is the account contract's address (IF you go through it).
Soon it will not be possible to execute contracts without going through your account contract, but it's still allowed for a little while","",""

I've found the issue, I have deployed multiple account contracts, and expect to use my new account 002. but when I deploy this new cairo contract and `increase_balance` it misses parameter `--account=002` So ti defaults to the very first account `__default__` so that is why I saw a different caller_address in tx_trace and get_balance can only get increased balance for old account contract address. as long as I tried everything with `--account=002` it works like a charm!","","üëç (1)"

"522934030123925506","_andrew#7540","01/06/2022 6:53 pm","Hey everybody,
A critical bug was recently discovered in the OZ Account library. The bug could allow a malicious contract to take ownership of an account that unwittingly interacts with it‚Äîeven if it's behind another contract. The malicious contract could achieve this by using a reentrant call to reutilize the signature and reset the calling account's public key.

The bug has since been fixed. Some important things to note:
- **exploiting this bug on mainnet is not possible due to StarkWare's whitelisting protocol**
- **OZ Contracts for Cairo v0.1.0 release is safe and does not include this bug**
- the reported bug is here with further details on the exploit: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/issues/344 
- the fix is in this PR: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/pull/347 

If your project copied the unreleased OZ Account library from `main` *after* #233 was merged (which was late March), please apply the fix üôÇ Thank you!","","üíØ (2)"

"810700810190848012","calabashsquash","07/06/2022 1:12 pm","Yep so I know the commands required to deploy an account contract. I am asking how it is technically and economically possible to deploy an account contract without paying TX fees (which itself requires an account with funds to pay said fees). The entire point of TX fees is to appropriately deal with network congestion by allowing the market to adjust the cost of network participation. If you do not have TX fees for even just one aspect of the network, you're opening the network up to just get flooded with a bunch of noisey transactions (since they don't cost anything).

I'm aware that up until now, they just haven't enforced fees. This has been acceptable since the network is only in alpha. But as of today's update, fees are enforced. I am wondering how a TX that involves deploying a new account contract is executing without there being funds on that account contract to pay the TX fees.

Let me know if that still doesn't make sense and I'll try rewording again :)","","‚úÖ (1)"

2) Eventually, wallets will send the fees to the account contract address in advance, and sequencer takes it from there. The address can be calculated in advance, so that's not an issue.

If a program takes ``o(k)`` steps to be ran, its proof takes ``o(log(k))`` steps to be verified. So if you have a lot of proofs on L2, some people could decide to wait and generate a proof or their calculations together before submitting this ""shared proof"" to StarkNet which would restart the same process, so the final proof would be verified in ``o(log(log(k))``. Is this what is called a L3? As I understand it, scalability looks infinite because the more users there are the lower the cost per user. If we had an infinite number of users, would the final proof take o(log(log(log ... k ...))) steps to be proven, so 0 steps per user? If yes that's really nice for calculations, but what's the catch?

Checkpoint is a library to index StarkNet events and make them accessible through a GraphQL API. Checkpoint is heavily inspired by The Graph and aims to provide the same solution on StarkNet.

I can fix it by adding `return()` at the end, but it then exits the function prematurely.

Actually fixed it by adding at the end of my if and else cases:

```    tempvar syscall_ptr :felt* = syscall_ptr
    tempvar pedersen_ptr :HashBuiltin* = pedersen_ptr

One notable difference with proxy contracts versus other contract implementations is that calling @view methods also requires an account abstraction.

The differences in getter methods written in Python, for example, are as follows:

I would like to thank you for the STARK Math series. They are really helpful and they are helping me to (almost üòÖ) understand STARKS.

However, I think this particular article (https://medium.com/starkware/arithmetization-ii-403c3b3f4355) forgets to express an important point. It seems to me that besides the composition polynomial, the Reed-Solomon encoding of the trace (called `f` in the article) also needs to pass the low-degree testing.","",""
"796146577755996170","aybehrouz","29/07/2022 9:28 pm","We know that when we have a low degree polynomial `p(x)` and we calculate `g(x) = p(x) / (x - a)`, if `p(a) = 0` then
`g(x)` would be a polynomial of degree less than `deg(p) - 1`. If `p(a) != 0` then `g(x)` will be a rational function which is far from any **low degree** polynomial. However if `p(x)` is not a polynomial when `p(x) != 0`, `g(x)` will not be a rational function and it can be close to a low degree polynomial by choosing `p` appropriately.

So I suppose when we are testing the composition polynomial we should run the low-degree testing for `f` to make sure the numerator of the composition polynomial is a low degree polynomial. However, still there could be a problem. Low degree testing can only assure that `f` is not far from a polynomial, but it can not guarantee that `f` is a low degree polynomial. Back to our simple example, if `p(x)` is close to a low degree polynomial (but is not a polynomial), can we say that `p(x) / (x - a)` will be far from any low degree polynomial when `p(a) != 0`?","",""

It likely only makes sense for a small subset of problems ‚Äî since you need to adjust the bloom filter parameters depending on your use case (false positive probability & capacity of the set)

Though, thinking more about it now after your question... I think you're right. It likely would not make sense as a dynamic data structure that you can add members to from a contract. Since you'd probably want to pack the bits into a single storage slot, and if any of those bits change you'd get charged for that whole change right?","",""

"270980684053610507","feltroidprime","15/08/2022 10:57 pm","Hi guys! A question about @view functions and contracts memory.
I have a @view function that calls an internal loop like this :
```
@view
func get_all_trusted_signers_addresses{
    syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr
}() -> (trusted_eth_addresses_len : felt, trusted_eth_addresses : felt*):
    alloc_locals
    let (local len) = trusted_signers_addresses_len.read()
    let (trusted_eth_addresses : felt*) = alloc()

    get_all_trusted_signers_loop(trusted_eth_addresses, 0, len)

    return (len, trusted_eth_addresses)
end

func get_all_trusted_signers_loop{
    syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr
}(array : felt*, index : felt, max : felt):
    if index == max:
        return ()
    end
    let (eth_address) = trusted_signers_addresses.read(index)
    assert [array] = eth_address

    get_all_trusted_signers_loop(array + 1, index + 1, max)
    return ()
end
```

So at each call to the view function it will build a new felt* array of size len and return it.
I have therefore two questions : 
1) Why when the contract is deployed, this view function is ""free"" on Voyager ?  meaning I don't need to submit a transaction and pay gas for it. The function could be more complicated and very costly to compute yet I don't have to pay anything on voyager. Where is the computation happening ? Is it on voyager's full node ? 

2) Since I expect many calls to this view function and that the result will stay the same for very long periods, is it correct to assume that a lot of memory in the contract will be wasted because it will build a new array each time and cairo memory is immutable ?

If yes to 2) I'll try to manage with storing a felt* casted to a felt which will point to the already built array. I think it should be feasible for my case.","",""

I have deployed the implementation contract and the proxy contract.
But stuck in here, not sure in which format to pass the selector.
at the moment am not writing scripts, just cairo contracts and directly deploying it in testnet and tryout from voyager.

here is the proxy contract : https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x0012e4618a9947c908f7aad0eff3a618407fc769cdf6bc416854f299fab72f38#writeContract

can someone tell me in which format to pass the function selector from voyager, so i can call the initialized function.


I am not sure if the way i did is correct.

what i did is, first declared the implementation contract and got its class hash, and than passed the class hash while deploying the proxy contract.
am not sure if thats it, or shoult i deploy the implementation contract again, or how the implementation contract will be deployed. will the proxy contract automatically deploy the implementation contract?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/793094838987128844/1009366802549190696/Screenshot_from_2022-08-17_13-05-53.png",""

It's a language that allows writing provable programs (in the sense that their execution is provable). That said, there are several ways to interpret your question
1. In StarkNet, where the smart contracts are written in Cairo, can I prove things about the state of other chains, like my balance in Polygon. The short answer is yes, but that's not necessarily Cairo-related. As long as you have some bridging from that chain, e.g. a contract that holds the state commitment of Polygon, you can verify things against it (e.g. via storage proofs).
2. You can use Cairo to potentially make the above verifications easier by submitting to a Cairo verifier contract in StarkNet a proof that says something about the state of Polygon, given some commitment. You can then compare that commitment against what's stored in the Polygon bridge contract.
3. You can do the above in any chain, as long as you have some Cairo verifier contract that you can submit proofs to.","","üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (1)"

I'm trying to interact with my contract deployed on a `localhost` node. but I can't get an account with ETH to pay gas fees.

I'm using `nile`. when running `nile node` it creates accounts with pre-loaded ETH:
```
Account #0
Address: 0x47267db87a934d32b81e98b3a49677bb93c1c1c52a0e7e0551e9df41e199496

Private key: 0x66c6c3d570dfcc06208a88e00fb76752

...
```

however, I don't know how to use these accounts with `nile send`. I know how to create new accounts (with `nile setup`) but they don't have any ETH on them.

can anyone explain to me how I can run a local node and interact with contracts that I deploy (either by setting gas fees to 0 or being able to get accounts with pre-loaded ETH). it doesn't have to be with `nile`.

"961635855007617034","itisok","25/08/2022 1:14 am","## **Estimating the Transaction Fee**

Before running the actual transaction, we need to estimate the associated fee.

```jsx

starknet estimate_fee --address 0x7394cbe418daa16e42b87ba67372d4ab4a5df0b05c6e554d158458ce245bc10 --network alpha-goerli --function mint --abi erc20_abi.json --inputs 0xcd70196a5edc2bd5c903c63fb3c119db1a2b10013d820434eb4be0245d623d 100000000000000000000 0
```

If all goes well, we get the estimated fee in the format of:

`The estimated fee is: 12542835995664 WEI (0.000013 ETH).`

Since this is an estimate, we will markup 50%, and use it as max fee for the transaction:

`echo ""12542835995664*1.5"" | bc`

   `18814253993496.0`

## **Executing the Transaction**

Finally, we are ready!

```jsx
starknet invoke --address 0x7394cbe418daa16e42b87ba67372d4ab4a5df0b05c6e554d158458ce245bc10 --network alpha-goerli --function mint --abi erc20_abi.json --max_fee 18814253993496 --inputs 0xcd70196a5edc2bd5c903c63fb3c119db1a2b10013d820434eb4be0245d623d 100000000000000000000 0

So if a contract that is NOT a contract-account is being directly invoked (which is possible through the --no-wallet tag, and causes caller_address == 0), does that mean that the contract (that is not a contract-account) is charged with the gas fees?

I'm slowly starting my journey in exploring starknet stack so excuse me if i miss some points (and don't hesitate to correct me) but I have some question on how i could integrate starknet for my use case (CEX handling of  native token and fungible assets)
1/ From what i have read so far, contrary to ethereum, there is no EOA so one should deploy a contract in order to interact with the chain. Is it correct ?
2/ Looking at this discussion: https://community.starknet.io/t/account-keys-and-addresses-derivation-standard/1230/7 , it seems that a mechanism close to CREATE2 is already existing, can we in this way precompute address before deployment, send token to this before it's been deployed and deploy afterward ? 
3/ BONUS : Are there solutions that would allow upgradability while keeping predeploy deterministic address of the contract (   in case question 2 is a positive answer)

It's somewhat long to explain, but I'll do my best to be brief. I've been working for some time now on a game design pattern where 2+ players compete completely off-chain in a fully P2P fashion, and, once a winner is decided, the whole match is verified on-chain. The game flow was supposed to work like this:
1) A player would create a room on-chain. He would provide a new public key just for that match.
2) A second player would joins the room on-chain, providing his own public key.
3) At this moment, a random number was to be created. From this number, a map, some items and starting positions could be derived, but not stored on-chain: my idea was to use** a view function with the random seed as input, and the whole initial game state as the output**.
4) Players would connect through the frontend and exchange signed turns via WebRTC (fully P2P). They would store the whole chain of signed turns locally until one of them won.
5) The winner would then be able to call an external function, providing the whole set of turns. Each turn would be verified on-chain (the whole game logic is written in a state transition view function) and, if the player was actually the winner, the game would be closed.","",""

The easiest one would be a ``__delegated_execute__`` function which just asks a signature as a parameter and can be called by anyone. That way the transaction would be paid by the account which calls you automatically (but then that means you are not the one sending the transaction and you need an interaction with someone). The one that is being working one requires changing the protocol if I understood correctly and works with a paymaster. Basically you can allow someone to spend your funds to send his transactions, the cool thing is the logic is ran on chain so you don't need to interact in real time with someone.","",""

```

1. I have developed `addDeployTransaction` with Go

3. reproduce the exact same pb with `starknet-js` and fixed it as explained with `json` package. It looks like the problem comes from the way data are stored inside the .json output of the compile and the goal of the `json` is to manage the BigNumber format.
4. On the other hand I do not have the issue with the latest OZ 0.4.0b account and Cairo compiler v0.10.

` starknet declare --contract build/main.json --network alpha-goerli`

or 

`starknet declare --contract build/main.json --gateway_url http://localhost:5050 --feeder_gateway_url http://localhost:5050 --network_id ""devnet"" --chain_id 0x534e5f474f45524c49`

I get `Error: KeyError: 'deployed'`  on both. I guess this is telling me the contract is already deployed, but I haven't previously declared or deployed this version, and the error persists on devnet even if I stop and restart the network. 

I'm using starknet 0.10.1

I would like some help with a very weird problem that I'm facing.

I'm trying to generate a small network over Cairo.

I'm uploading it into a local machine ""starknet-devnet""
I'm running around 500 contracts.

The weird thing is that after some contract didn't managed to be deployed, all the other contracts that I'm already deployed aren't recognizable.

for example, I'm uploading the following contract

Does anyone have an example on how to implement a `payable` function in a StarkNet contract. I have an ERC-721 contract implemented in Solidity where the mint() function is declared as payable and the mint costs some specific amount of ether. How can this be achieved in StarkNet? I tried to google it but without success.

Here is the Solidity code:

```
    // mints a new token to the caller
    function mint() external payable {
        require(_totalSupply < _maxSupply, ""ERC721: maximum supply reached"");
        require(msg.value == mintPrice, ""ERC721: not enought ether sent to mint"");

I am setting up a startup that is going to use Cairo language to prove that operations executed off-chain, that changes the on-chain smart-contract's state are legit.
I have simplified my scenario and there are 2 simple parts of my proof of concept:

1. My first step is to create an solidity contract that will act as a simple treasury, that means it will only store the balances of users and will have 3 methods 'deposit' (transacted by user), 'withdraw' (transacted by user) and 'change' (transacted by Cairo code with valid proof).
2. Cairo program that based on input data and current state, transfers balance from one account to another deducting a little fee and adding it to the chosen account. I want to aggregate this simple Cairo executions (transactions) and after some number (for example 100) of such executions/transactions, aggregate them into one state change/delta, aggregate traces and generate proof. Then transact smart-contract's 'change' method  and pass state change and proof to it. Then the method is going to verify based on the provided proof if such state change is valid, and if so apply this state change to the current state

1. Do gas costs scale with message size relative to L1 gas. ie if im sending a lot of data from L2 to L1 will I incur significantly more costs due to more L1 storage being used

2. Can each contract only have one message per sender?

3. What happens if there is already a message in the inbox for a contract and it gets ovveriden? Is the previous message lost?

4. Is reading a message on L1 a view function?","","ü§ù (1)"

I'm having an issue when trying to `declare` :  Error: 20: Contract not found

The step I've done:
1. Download the account contract source code via https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x05ee2c467c07d892106700c068e2c696a42944b08b56e69ef8aa13bcfd4b400c#class
2. Compile the contract `starknet-compile oz-starknet-account/Account.cairo --account_contract --output Account.json`
3. Get the class hash `starkli class-hash Account.json`
4. Call the `declare` function

```async function declareContract(precalculatedAddress, privateKey) {
  const starkKeyPair = ec.getKeyPair(privateKey);

  const predeployedAccount = new Account(
    provider,
    precalculatedAddress,
    starkKeyPair
  );

  const compiledOZAccount = json.parse(
    fs.readFileSync(""./Account.json"").toString(""ascii"")
  );

- one on L2 -> to send a mint request to L1
- one on L1 -> to consume the request (mint NFT) and send the confirmation back to L2

Is it possible to somehow send the transaction on L1 without the user's action? Or even consume multiple messages from L2 on L1 via one transaction?","",""

2) Then I set the env var(PROTOSTAR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY) using this: ```export PROTOSTAR_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=[MY PRIVATE KEY HERE]```
2) Then I am trying to declare my contract with the following command:

Our games are created with Unity and the authentication flow must be fully functional on mobile.
We had no trouble creating our users with their L1 + L2 wallets on the web part. 
However, we are stuck on the implementation in Unity C# as there is no reference documentation. We are trying to do it directly through Bouncy Castle and it becomes quite complex.
To be more precise, we are able to create a private key + public key L1 for a new player who authenticates in the mobile game. From there, we also generate a Stark private key and we should be able to derive the public key from it. But it's on this last point that we are stuck.
We do have the Stark private key (child key) and are trying to derive the public key using that curve: https://docs.starkware.co/starkex/crypto/stark-curve.html

I'm looking into solutions on how to store information on-chain without revealing it itself.
We need this for some user information, which we'd like to verify later.
F.e.:
1. User has skill CSS
2. We store  this skill on-chain in user's account without revealing it itself, only proof
3. Anybody should be able to check if this information is valid (user really has this skill) using SC method like `checkSkill(""CSS"", ""<user>"") => bool`

So, we probably need ZKP
What I wanted to ask is: Can starkware help with this, do you provide any service for such case?
And because of my not-complete understanding of ZKP in general, I'd like to ask is ZKP good choice to go with in this case?

I've been trying to deploy smart-contracts presets from OpenZeppelin, but once deployed it doesn't show any view or write functions in the ""read contract""/""write contract"" tab of the explorer. Yet it does have @view and @external functions in the code. 
Did I do anything wrong ?

The problem seems to come from the @constructor : I can see the functions when I create a contract with no @constructor, but unable to see the functions once I add the @constructor. Not sure to understand why. Any idea ? 
It's a basic ERC721 constructor : 
@constructor
func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    name: felt, symbol: felt, owner: felt
) {
    ERC721.initializer(name, symbol);

Starknet documentation give some urls when talking about the CLI, but I am not sure it's the same for RPC. And in the specs repository I didn't find any url.

> 2. Make `fill_arr` *mutably* borrow a reference to its argument (which will need to be

so i tried this:

```
fn main() {
    let mut arr0 = ArrayTrait::new();

    fill_array(ref arr0);

    // Do not change the following line!
    arr0.print();

}

fn fill_array(ref arr: Array<felt252>) {

    arr.append(44);
    arr.append(66);
}

It is my understanding that cairo 1 has thankfully abstracted this otherwise confusing concept away (but I could be wrong). I make this claim because the updated cairo 1 book found here: https://cairo-book.github.io/ makes no mention of hints, but the cairo 0 starkware documentation does

cairo 1:
syscalls: the same as a syscall in assembly language. you are making a call to some optimized code that is part of the virtual machine. typically these can be hash functions, cryptographic operations, print statements, and other things that need to perform well and are optimized at the assembly level","","üî• (1)"

Thank you for your reply. I have written a contract and deployed it on Dev- & Testnet. This is the relevant code in which I do not use a `Span` yet so I might give it a try:

```
    struct Storage {
        length: usize,
        content: LegacyMap::<usize, u8>
    }

    #[external]
    fn set_content(bytes: Array::<u8>) {
        let mut idx: usize = 0_usize;
        set_bytes(idx, bytes);
    }

    fn set_bytes(mut idx: usize, mut bytes: Array<u8>) {
        check_gas();
        if !bytes.is_empty() {
            content::write(idx, bytes.pop_front().unwrap());
            idx = idx + 1_usize;
            set_bytes(idx, bytes)
        } else {
            length::write(idx);
        }
    }
```

I call the `set_content` function from a JavaScript inside a React app using `get-starknet`library. The error appears within argent wallet when trying to execute the transaction. However, it only seems to happen when the array has a certain length. So I thought that there might be some limitation regarding how many input data I can add to a function invoke.

What I am trying to do is saving an image within the storage of the contract.

```
starknet-compile --version
cairo-lang-starknet 1.1.0

cairo-compile --version
cairo-compile 0.11.2
```

With an input array of length 4796 I get the error. With a length of 4333 elements it works. Hmm üòÖ

I think i am getting close to the problem. I could send the following transaction but it fails later. Here is an example on Testnet. I will have a look into this.

There is no limitation on the number of parameters. Only regarding the number of cairo steps per block / transaction and the max gas per block.","","happy (1)"

If I understand correctly, my contract needs to be allowed to spend/transfer a specific amount via the ""approve()"" function of the ETH contract (https://testnet.starkscan.co/contract/0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7#overview) prior to processing the payment using the ""transferFrom()"" function of the ETH contract.

However, I am facing an intriguing situation when trying to use the ""approve()"" function from the ETH contract ->

```
#[external]
fn get_approval() {
    let ETH_adrs = _ETH_adrs::read();
    let my_contract: ContractAddress = get_contract_address();
    let price: u256 = u256_from_felt252(5000000000000000);

    IERC20Dispatcher{contract_address: ETH_adrs}.approve(my_contract, price);
}
```

I am able to deploy my contract on testnet and to use its ""get_approval()"" function above successfully (example of successful tx here: https://testnet.starkscan.co/tx/0x3e6d1213a502216490cdc90ccf9fd2a3e969de9a44d3444a06ccc65ca6f56cc) however when I check the ""allowance()"" function from the ETH contract it appears that the allowance for my contract is still 0...

Is there any chance someone can help me out, please?","",""

According to their repo, we take a seed-phrase, get ""null"" private key from it using ethers.
Then create starknet groundKey, publicKey, address

The question is, why do i need to store seed-phrase, if i can theoretically store the ""null"" ethereum private key? After doing this, i will be able to create multiple starknet accounts NOT connected to  not ""null"" (e.g. 1,2,.. etc) ethereum private keys.

Here's my code snippet:

`function generateWallet(phrase: string, index?: number): string[] {
    let keyPair: string[] = [];

    const signer = Wallet.fromPhrase(phrase);
    const masterNode = HDNodeWallet.fromSeed(signer.privateKey);

    const childNode = masterNode.derivePath(`m/44'/9004'/0'/0/${index}`);
    const groundKey = ""0x"" + ec.starkCurve.grindKey(childNode.privateKey);
    const publicKey = ec.starkCurve.getStarkKey(groundKey);
    const constructorCallData = CallData.compile({
        implementation: accountClassHash,
        selector: hash.getSelectorFromName(""initialize""),
        calldata: CallData.compile({
            signer: publicKey,
            guardian: ""0"",

    });
    let addr = hash.calculateContractAddressFromHash(
        publicKey,
        argentProxyClassHash,
        constructorCallData,
        0

why instead  i cant do like:

`const signer = Wallet(prv_key_1); // the prv_key_2 and so on

"950845066086350939","glihm","08/08/2023 9:37 pm","Hello, `starkware-libs/cairo-lang` is the old version of Cairo compiler and tools in `python`. But this is not the mainstream anymore, please now consider the `rust` implementation only, which is the `starkware-libs/cairo` repository.

In Starknet, the sequencer (the program responsible of processing the transactions and producing the blocks of the blockchain) must run code - the smart contracts (among other). The smart contracts written in Cairo are compiled to be executed by the sequencer. So we can see here that the sequencer is always associated to a specific version of the Cairo programming language.

You can see the versions like this (high level view):

`Starknet sequencer (aka Starknet network) [v0.12.1]` = the version that takes in account the sequencer version itself and what it can run. (The shorthand is `Starknet v0.12.1`).

`Cairo version (v2.1.0)` = the Cairo programming language version that is supported by the Starknet sequencer.

Now, the consideration is the following => When a starknet version is released, it is associated with a version of the cairo compiler. Which means that a developer must take care of using locally a Cairo version that is supported by the Starknet network. If not, the contract (cairo code) will not be deployable.","","üî• (1)"

1. What are the components involved in the process, and who is running them (Prover, Sequencer, Validator)
2. How are the proof of computations generated (and how it relates to Cairo)? I guess that there's some proof exchange
3. Advanced: is there any support for private (encrypted) functions and state. 

I'll appreciate some references to good high-level resources & from there I'll manage to deep dive üòÑ","",""

The docs mention that the network has a single Sequencer run by Starkware. You briefly talk about the prover, but it's not clear:
1. Who is running it? 
2. Is it decentralized (or also a single one)?

Lastly, why do we need to separate the Prover from the sequencer - if I understand it correctly the prover must run the execution again (2nd time)","",""

"770342544797204500","lancenonce","23/09/2023 3:02 am","Hi everyone, I want to prove an MNIST model built with Giza's Orion library. The input is an Orion tensor made from ArrayTraits:

```
    let mut shape = ArrayTrait::<usize>::new();
    shape.append(196);
    let mut data = ArrayTrait::<i32>::new();
    data.append(i32 { mag: 0, sign: false });
    data.append(i32 { mag: 0, sign: false });
    ...
    data.append(i32 { mag: 0, sign: false });
    TensorTrait::<i32>::new(shape.span(), data.span())
```

I want to prove this program with the stone prover. The fibonacci example has this input:

```
{
    ""fibonacci_claim_index"": 10
}
```

How does one create arbitrary input JSON files for the stone prover? I tried compiling my input program, but it doesn't work as a standalone project; it's a part of a greater Scarb project. My goal is to use the `cpu_air_prover` and `cpu_air_verifier` commands to prove and verify the .casm files generated from the Orion scripts.","",""
