Yes, in the first flow chart, to query the state and check some information, you can use inspects.

Regarding the other flow charts, they contain some unnecessary steps. To pay, Users can directly deposit assets without having to ask for a specific output. To deposit assets, instead of sending inputs to the InputFacet, the users interact with another Facet, either the EtherPortalFacet, ERC20PortalFacet, or ERC721PortalFacet. Using the deposit function of one of these facets, the user transfers the assets to the portal and includes any data. Then, the Rollups Framework sends a special advance state to the backend containing the deposit information.

Vouchers, on the other hand, are outputs from the backend that define a contract call. So they are a way for the DApp to interact with the blockchain. For example, they allow users to withdraw assets from the portal. So, they aren't used to transfer assets to the DApp.
Let me know if you have any more doubts!","",""

Ok, so after investigation I found out that the toolchain version changed from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0 and I also have an issue with building that echo-rust example. But when I change to the last toolchain image which is built for M1 everything works fine as it should.","",""

I'm continuing the conversation here because the problem that you encountered is specific to the rust implementation.

The second was about the encoding of the voucher. Basically it was converting the byte array to string, then encoding to hex. but it should encode directly to hex.
