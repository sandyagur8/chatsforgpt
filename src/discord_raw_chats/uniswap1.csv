So I came up with a  decentralized/permissionless ETH hardware wallet (Raspberry Pi inside) with uniswap v3 contract direct token Swap and physically transferrable private keys. There are two scripts, one L1, and other using uniswap v3 on polygon (an L2). For swaps, I'm using the opensource python-uniswap python module, which has an incredibly simple to customize contract direct function.  You can easily pick and change some variables to have the device work with whatever swapping pair you would like!","","üí• (5),üî• (4)"

So at this point, when selecting the device boot script, you would point the booter to either the polygon python file or the ETH file.  I'm very open to coding the button switch directly onto the device, it just depends on what participants would prefer.

Quadrat is a non-custodial, permissionless active liquidity management protocol for Uniswap v3. It is designed to automatically rebalance assets in Uniswap v3 liquidity pools, enabling users to earn the highest annual percentage yield (APY) on every liquidity pool, and also help Uniswap v3 concentrate liquidity at trading price range more capital efficiently and attract more trading volume.

Because of 95% of users do not manage their capital efficiently, they don't earn anything in the protocol, and only 2% of liquidity providers made $500M from Uniswap fees last year. Quadrat is a much-needed solution that will enable all users to earn an APY on their liquidity, regardless of their expertise or time commitment. With Quadrat, users can earn **up to 10x more APY** than they would without it.

With Uniswap v3 being one of the most popular DeFi protocols, Quadrat is well positioned to become the leading liquidity provider and manager for Uniswap v3, and earn a significant return on provided liquidity for its users.

The rebalancing feature allows rebalancing liquidity in Uniswap pools in one click. It helps liquidity providers to maximize their APY by constantly rebalancing their pools to reflect changes in market conditions. Anyone can create a strategy to manage their capital or a public strategy to manage public capital with a revenue share model.

Quadrat Protocol is only available for** Quadrat NFT Pass owners**. NFT Pass is fully liquid and trading in the liquidity pool on **SudoSwap** (Uniswap NFT protocol)

**For Liquidity Providers**:
- Provide liquidity in the Quadrat Strategies for any Uniswap v3 Pool with the highest APY and endless active rebalancing strategies, decreasing your IL
- Monitor your positions, APY, IL, volume and rebalance assets between strategies
- Fully non-custodial and permissionless protocol, passively improving your APY from the liquidity provision
- Current 0xPlasma Strategies APY is in the range between 50 and 500% APY for a basic assets: USDT, BTC, AAVE, ETH, UNI, Matic, etc.

**For Asset (liquidity) Managers**:
- create private strategies for personal funds or create public strategies, manage capital and earn performance fee
- rebalance your position in one transaction, saving gas fees with an advanced quantum rebalancer and pool calculator
- integrate your strategies in gnosis safe or investment DAO to scale the investment tools

**For Token Projects**:
- Create optimal strategies for your token liquidity pool on Uniswap v3 and let your community provide more liquidity and earn fees

**For Uniswap v3 Protocol**l:
- Quadrat protocol attracts more liquidity and optimizes Uniswap v3 Pools; as a result, pools become more capital efficient, attract more trading volume and help earn more fees for LP
- Quadrat's simple UI allows new DeFi users to passively provide capital and learn how Uniswap v3 works.

- sometimes it's rebalancing from range to a new range
- sometimes it's squeezing or spreading the current range

I'm Paul from KYVE Team. Nice to e-meet you all! :flyingunicorn: 

**What is KYVE?**

KYVE is a Web3 data lake solution and protocol enabling data providers to standardize, validate in a decentralized way, and store any data streams into decentralized storage solutions such as Arweave. 

We are partners (and they are also our investors) with most of the L1s (Solana, Polkadot, Near, Avalanche, Celo, Moonbeam, Cosmos, etc.)

**How it works briefly? **

Basically, for each data source, you need to create a pool. For example, to connect to archive the Solana blockchain, you will create a pool and fund it with KYVE token; nodes (PoS mechanism) will join the pool and will start to archive the blockchain into the storage solution that you decided during the creation of the pool. When data are uploaded, your funding decrease to pay the nodes. When the data are uploaded, they're free to access and store forever if you use for example, Arweave.

**Why am I coming on the Uniswap Discord to talk about KYVE?**

Great news we just released a pool today... **This new integration archives all swaps, mints, burns & more from the USDC-ETH Uniswap smart contract**. With over 100k+ transactions occurring on Uniswap each day, it can be quite tedious to query through all this data & find exactly what you need. 

Not to mention the possible need to source from multiple different providers, opening yourself up to risk. Having a trustless source that validates this data in a decentralized way is imperative in order to perform proper analyses & research or even to create trustless platforms & dashboards for users to follow their trading. 

Via this integration, anyone can easily access all events that occurred on the USDC-ETH Uniswap smart contract in order to perform market analyses, user data dashboards, research, etc. üßë‚Äçüíª

& the best part you don't pay to acess the data you remember! That's cool no? 

**We are still in testnet so the PoS mechanism is not implemented yet, we recommend you don't use this data for the moment in another way than testing!  **

We wanted to share with you a project that we believe aligns with the decentralized ethos that Uniswap represents - Literully.

Literully is a decentralized voting platform built on the Polygon blockchain. Our goal is to empower communities to make transparent and decentralized decisions through the use of smart contracts. We believe that this is crucial for the continued growth and success of the decentralized ecosystem.

We are soon to launch our governance token, Decentralight (DLT), which will be used to monetize the decentralized solutions that Literully has or will have. DLT will also be used as your voting power when it comes to decision making processes within the Literully platform.

We think that Uniswap and Literully complement each other well and we would love to explore any potential opportunities for collaboration.

META GOLD MINERS CLUB - 


The Meta Gold Miners Club (MGMC) is a project inspired by the world we live in today, and is focused on sharing knowledge with it's members about important financial concepts, and helping increase the wealth of our community through our Gold Rewards Program (GRP). 

We will provide education to our community about concepts such as Sound Money Principles, and the role that gold and bitcoin can play in preserving wealth; alongside other utilities that bring exclusive value to our NFT holders.

With **GOLD-BACKED NFTS**, the MGMC presents a unique opportunity for members to diversify their holdings, reduce risk, and learn about new technologies. MGMC gold backed NFTs will be a solution to the problem of establishing and maintaining inherent value in digital assets, which are often based on hype or utility alone, with no guaranteed floor price.

By backing our NFTs with gold, we aim to provide a stable store of value for our members. All tied together with a story that is relevant to the modern world in order to interact with our community in a fun and engaging way.","",""

I would like to introduce to you a new blockchain-based project that is completely built on Uniswap - HarbergerToken. 

HarbergerToken offers a perfect decentralized tool, it is designed to fund sustainable development for open source communities, providing efficient capital utilization and long-term returns through innovative risk-free mortgage and assetization of taxing rights NFTs. 

Through HarbergerToken, open source projects can issue unique HBG tokens that are completely built on Uniswap, thereby obtaining sustainable income and investment opportunities. The HBG tokens can be used to generate transaction fees, which are distributed to the NFTs token holders. In addition, the risk-free mortgage and assetization of taxing rights NFTs for HBG tokens allow members of the open source community to efficiently utilize their funds and gain long-term returns.

We believe that HarbergerToken will become an important part of Uniswap and open source communities, providing reliable infrastructure for sustainable development of open source projects.

I am building a decentralized Peer-to-Peer lending protocol for web3 communities. The platform will create community pools where only eligible members of a DAO will be able to borrow from the pool. Our solution will additionally vet borrowers based on their on-chain revenues and activity, allowing web3 natives to build their off-chain credit scores.

For lenders, our model aims to provide a real yield between 6-8% that is not correlated with the market, offering a sustainable and attractive return on investment.

We are specifically targeting Web3 borrowers with a credit score of 600 or above offering competitive borrowing rates of 10-12% for personal loans. In case of a default, the borrowers would be reported to credit bureaus, impacting their credit scores and future loan eligibility. 

Curious to become a Lender or a Borrower? I would be thrilled to discuss this in more detail and gain insights from your perspective. Please let me know if you are curious and open to exploring this further.

It's different from Uniswap oracles, not only because it aggregates many pools, but also because it performs seven layers of validation. Adrastia is unmatched in terms of security mechanisms.

Additionally, while Uniswap v3 oracles can only provide TWAPs up to 24 hours, Adrastia can provide TWAPs over months at a time.

Not only does Adrastia provide price and liquidity feeds, but we also provide volatility and average interest rate feeds with our latest v4 update.

These data feeds can even be plugged into our novel rate controller system, Adrastia Prudentia, to take DeFi risk management to the next level! Prudentia can be used to secure and improve interest rates, supply&borrow caps, collateral factors, and more!

My aim for application to give the user as much useful information as possible with just glance at the page. If you have any recommendations 
on alpha I can offer the user I will try my best to add what I can. 

The application is not live yet but I am close to having an MVP for users to test out. I am the only person working on the project so delays may occur...

Thanks for reading and I look forward to any feedback you may have!","","üëå (2)"

Feel free to check it out and play around with it. I'd love to hear some feedback and suggestions if you have any!
