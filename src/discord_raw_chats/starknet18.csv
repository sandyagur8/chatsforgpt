I just tested StarkScan. Nice tool.👏

Why does the scanner show only successful transactions for the wallet/address at the moment? I'm finding it a bit confusing.
It would be great if it showed all the txns(e.g. failed), and let's say with a filter UI element by status or something like that.

During my journey with Straknet I got a few failed transactions, e.g. on 10kswap, on myswap, aspect dapps
I wanted to dig in, but to find them wasn't that simple! The only chance I found to find them is to look in activity tab in the ArgentX wallet. It is not convenient
