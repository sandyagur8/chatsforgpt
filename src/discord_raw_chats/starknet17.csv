Some initial notes/comments: 

- I compiled and ran the node but hit a papyrus_node does not exist error after boot. The node file does exist so not 100% sure whats going on may be user error.
- The Docker method worked and was easy.
- Sync time was varied but the full sync was somewhere in the 24-36hr range but I did need to shut down power a few times for expended periods (not node related)

This is on a Lenovo M73 Tiny with i3, 8gb RAM and a 500gb SSD. Running Ubuntu 22.04 and on gigabit internet.","",""

1. Check your internet connection and ensure that you have access to the repository 'ghcr.io/starkware-libs/papyrus:dev'. You can try accessing the repository in your web browser to verify if it is accessible.

2. Verify the correctness of the image name and repository. Make sure you have entered the correct name and spelled it correctly.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to pull the image from the specified repository. Some repositories require authentication or access tokens to pull the images. Check the documentation of the repository to see if any additional authentication is required.

4. It's also possible that the image you are trying to pull does not exist in the specified repository. Double-check if the image 'ghcr.io/starkware-libs/papyrus:dev' is indeed available in the repository.","",""

You can try logging into the repository using the Docker command `docker login ghcr.io` and providing valid credentials.

6. If you are behind a proxy or firewall, ensure that Docker is configured correctly to work with the proxy. You can check Docker's documentation to see how to configure the proxy settings.

7. Restart your Docker daemon. Sometimes restarting the Docker service can resolve networking or caching issues.","",""
