At the very least, it would require us to to completely rewrite the `Horus-compile` part from scratch, so it's a major undertaking we haven't been able to allocate resources to just yet. Unfortunately, there is also no specific timeline. That said, we understand that the community will shift towards Cairo 1. and Horus will need to shift with it, so it's definitely on our radars.","","❤️ (252),StarkNet (242)"

Fancy formally verifying a Starknet AMM this weekend? 

🔥 In part 2 of Introduction to Horus, our team shows us how to use Horus, our open-source formal verification tool, to verify a simple AMM contract. 

🙏 Check it out & share your thoughts!
