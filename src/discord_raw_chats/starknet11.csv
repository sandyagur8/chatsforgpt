1) It is not well documented yet (we'll add it right now!), but you can create AccountClient object without deploying new contract by using its constructor instead of create_account method.
Example snippet how to do it:
```
from starknet_py.net import AccountClient, KeyPair
AccountClient(YOUR_ACCOUNT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, KeyPair.from_private_key(YOUR_ACCOUNT_CONTRACT_PRIVATE_KEY), ""testnet"")
```
We pass KeyPair object create using your private key. You can retrive account_address and private_key from the AccountClient object when you created it for the first time. Also you can change ""testnet"" to any URL you want.
2) Yes, you can do it. You can use add_transaction method of AccountClient. Called contract does not have to be deployed via same account. 

Btw, we recommend using Contract object (again, create it via constructor without deploying extra contract) and making you calls through that object","",""

`data_transformer=DataTransformer(abi=events_abi,`
`identifier_manager=identifier_manager_from_abi(abi))`
`transformed_data = data_transformer.to_python(data)`

* abi is the abi of the contract
* events_abi is the abi of an event you want to decode, for example:

`{'data': [{'name': 'new_governor_nominee', 'type': 'felt'}, {'name': 'nominated_by', 'type': 'felt'}], 'keys': [], 'name': 'governor_nominated', 'type': 'event'}`

However, there is a problem with the event’s abi. It has ‘data’ instead of ‘outputs’ and we currently don’t support that. I’ve created an issue (https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.py/issues/231) on our github, but it can take some time to finish it, so there is a workaround.

You can take the event’s abi and change the ‘data’ key to ‘outputs’.

I've a contract using names starting with underscore. And using the `DataTransformer` for get back data from Cairo to Python (to decode transactions return data) will raise:

It's a namedtuple limitation.

Am I the only one using underscore? Maybe are there not recommended?
I could deal with it on my own project, but I plan to use the `DataTransformer` into `ape-starknet`, so it will impact everybody at the end.

Note: I'm using the latest 0.3 version, I didn't yet do the 0.4 upgrade. But given those lines, it will have the same issue: https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.py/blob/e0d06d1040dcaa2e8d1abecaa7562f44c595f90d/starknet_py/utils/data_transformer/data_transformer.py#L342-L347","",""

class_hash is a hash of the class you want have proxy to

- wait for acceptance

`await proxy_deployment.wait_for_acceptance()

- create an instance of proxy with different abi

`proxy = Contract(address=proxy.address, abi=abi, client=client)

abi is an abi of the contract you want have proxy to

You need to turn it into an int first, python ints support arbitrary range, so we don't need to string type those things. We allow passing short strings that are translated like strings in cairo - every character gets encoded.

If value is constant, then you can do `test = 0xad23132bda12` and python will read it as an int right away. 
If you don't know this value statically you can use `int(your_hex, 16)`","",""

Version 0.13.0 of StarkNet.py has been released 🔥, most notably adding 🆕 `Account` class to replace the old `AccountClient`. We’ve also deprecated a couple of things including the `Starknet<>Ethereum` messaging.

⚠️ We highly encourage you consider migrating to new `Account` early. `AccountClient` is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

See our migration guide for more details https://starknetpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration_guide.html#migration-guide and check out the whole release on github https://github.com/software-mansion/starknet.py/releases/tag/0.13.0-alpha","",""

I think we should add an official node that comes from under the hood. I don't want to use Alchemy or any third-party node URL.","",""

In my case, the problem occurred after I upgraded my wallet contract to cairo 1. Some have suggested adding a `cairo_version=1` parameter to the execute function:

`await account.execute(calls=call, cairo_version=1)`

And another way is to interact with the Account class, first we call sign_invoke_transaction from it, and then we send the transaction using the function execute.
