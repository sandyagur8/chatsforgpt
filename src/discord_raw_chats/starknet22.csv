🎺 The Braavos wallet extension is available on the Chrome Store and is live on Starknet testnet 🎺 

Users can create accounts, connect to dApps, manage tokens and see their NFT collections inside the wallet 💥 

We have been building Braavos with developers in mind 🛠️ 
Developers can use the wallet in `headless mode` in order to auto-test their dApp - See details here [1].
In addition, we have released the `get-starknet-wallet` library that is compatible with the current getStarknet() API but is able to support multiple wallets on StarkNet - see details here [2]

We are here to help with any issue and will be happy if you reach out! 🤝

"706109560091574362","mottyl","21/04/2022 3:28 pm","Hi @LauriP 👋 

Yes, we auto deploy a contract for each account in your wallet. 
It will support all the functionality you know from classic smart-contract base wallets - social recovery, account segmentation, guardians, etc. Plus, a few new surprises we will present closer to mainnet launch.
Source code will be published in the near future.
 
If you want to experience it, you can download and take a look here: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/braavos-wallet/jnlgamecbpmbajjfhmmmlhejkemejdma>

Will be happy to get any feedback 🙏","",""

What about custom account contracts? Do you allow user to switch to one? If not now, is it planned?","",""
"706109560091574362","mottyl","21/04/2022 3:44 pm","Not currently. Need to think if it makes sense, as at least some of the IF functionality relates to the capabilities of the contract (might make sense to have a ""basic"" mode). But if there will be a demand we will definitely consider.","",""
"511272055623122961","laurip","21/04/2022 3:46 pm","understood 🙂 and I agree it's not a trivial thing to do. if you never allow it, you will have problems integrating new innovative account contract features in your wallet, since you'd need to custom-code support for every one of them.
I expect custom account contracts to be a thing in near future. Or at least the possibility for users to incorporate new features in the used account contract, in some fashion","",""

1. Created a Seed Phrase in Argent X
2. Imported that Seed Phrase into Braavos
3. Added new wallet to the seed phrase in Braavos (and put money into it and used it)
4. Initiated a withdrawal from Starknet to ETH mainnet
5. Resetted the wallet in Braavos
6. Then imported the same Seed again but the wallet from the step 3 didnt appear. Neither in Braavos nor in Agrent X.

We are excited to introduce the “How-to Series”, the videos that help you get the best out of your #self-custodial wallet on #StarkNet.

Please use these videos as much as possible to educate future and new Braavosians! 

You can find the videos in #deleted-channel .

Last, is there any functionality you'd like us to put into a video?
Let us know in #deleted-channel

One of the most important articles of the beginning of 2023  for the #starknet tech community almost went unnoticed. 🔏 

Published yesterday morning in a heavy flow of tweets, it had also escaped me.
Fortunately, some of you came to tell me about it. 🙏 

This article is the result of a collaboration between StarkWare :StarkNet: and Braavos :braavos: .
The article aimed to demonstrate how Account Abstraction allows wallets to meet (and exceed) the UX expectations of Web2 users and how Braavos harnessed this capability to introduce the Hardware Signer.

Whether you're a techie or not, a degen or an investor, this article is a must-read to understand how the Hardware Signer, and Braavos Wallet, is a game changers in the crypto world.

If you see this message, rejoice: you are early in the Braavos long adventure!

Hi @everyone 

Motty is out of stage where he presented the Braavos new security concept that strikes a balance between high levels of protection & ease of adoption. 
It have been designed to ensure a seamless experience.

In few words, we added the Multi-Signer (3FA) on top of the Hardware Signer (2FA). 

What does it means for you, as Braavos Wallet users?
It means that, with the 3FA, you are using the wallet that offers the highest level of security, while being able to customize it for each of your accounts.

Please give ❤️  and share 🔁  the good news.
Here is the official public announcement: https://twitter.com/myBraavos/status/1622548536444305411?s=20&t=MNnIwZKO0__xex2zNATqzg

The new wallet version is actually being tested by our official testers. 
So it will be released to you in the next couple of days!

Note that we will discuss thsi topic on Thursday during our Community Call. 
Please set your reminder!

The Multi-Signer adds additional layer of security on top of the Hardware / Protected Signer by securing your account with 2 keys from 2 different devices for ultimate security 🔐

You can enjoy 3-Factor-Authentication (3FA):
- something you know 📝
- something you have 📱
- something you are 👤
without the need for an additional seed phrase! 🔥

How to setup (on a Goerli Tetnet account)?
    1. On your browser Extension go to Account Settings -> Account Security and select Multi-Singer. You will see a QR code.
    2. Open your Braavos mobile app, scan the QR code and follow the instruction to sign the Multi-Signer setup transaction.

That's it! 💫

The new version 3.6.5 is avail on Google Chrome Store, Android Play Store and on the App Store.

"854602430813831188","yakexi","27/05/2023 9:57 am","Dear Team ,

I hope this message finds you well. I am in need of technical support from your team. Unfortunately, I have encountered a problem that has resulted in a loss of approximately 5000 USD, as I am currently unable to access the funds.
The issue at hand is that I used a Braavos-generated address and only saved the private key and address information. I bridged ETH to this address successfully. However, I have now lost both the recovery phrase and the application in my browser. I am unsure of how to transfer my funds from this address. It appears that in order to initiate a transfer, I need to deploy an account, and deploying an account requires a specific parameter known as a salt.
I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in helping me retrieve my funds. Is there any possibility of accomplishing this using only the private key and address information?
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I have a multisig braavos account setup and I'm trying to sign a tx on a air-gapped computer and then send that signed tx from another machine.
If I have it right, there are 2 steps to this, first being signing the tx with one of the accounts in the multisig and then invoking the signed tx from the multisig contract.
Doing this, im getting `Error message: Signers: invalid external account signer signature`. Is there something im missing?
