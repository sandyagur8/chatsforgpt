I've been looking at Starknet.js over the last couple of days in between doing other things. To do some simple testing with I deployed the basic contract from the Hello, StarkNet tutorial to Goerli. About 5 hours ago I sent a transaction using Starknet.js and the defaultProvider which worked without any issue. However, what I noticed when running another transaction with the same input value against the same contract, is that I was returned the transaction hash of the first transaction I sent, not a hash for the transaction I had just sent. To take StarkNet.js out of the picture, I did the same with the cli and again I received the transaction hash from the first transaction - sent over 5 hours earlier. So, I sent another transaction. This time I changed the input data slightly and received a new transaction hash. So, what this tells me is that I cannot presently send a transaction with the same input data. In this case I cannot send two subsequent transactions that increase the contract balance by the same amount.

Is there some limitation on Goerli that I am not yet aware of?","",""

I don't know if the discussion has been brought up before but I need to say it again anyway, I noticed that the transaction time for most of the major transaction is slow compare to other chain. I don't know why that is anyway. When I try to mint it takes a lot time. Swapping is not fast and another thing I noticed is that connecting to the network when fetching data to enable swapping is slow. The swapping features and both myswap and jediswap is buggy. Also while trying to approve transaction before swapping I get error not able to connect to starknet.

I tested everything according to the instructions. I may not be the first, but the speed of transactions, confirmations is the main problem here (5 minutes minimum waiting time)

Also, I don‚Äôt know on whose side this problem can be, but some code periodically crawls out in the argent wallet (I think the end user definitely doesn‚Äôt need this code). Also, at some point, the wallet is reset to zero, as in the very old work, but then all balances are returned. Whether this is related to the wallet or both the wallet and the network at the same time, I do not know.

I requested tokens via https://goerli.voyager.online/ - the transactions of the requested coins do not track themselves (the system says sorry, we can't).

Transaction data on https://goerli.voyager.online/ is very scarce (compare with other scanners).

In general, there is something to work on, I'm waiting for new versions. Good luck.","",""

1. I had problems with trying mint J26JAN2 through interaction with the contract, I sent a transaction multiple times and get the hash of the transaction, but the tokens do not appear in the wallet, and when i click on the link to the hash I get a blank page with an error (Screenshot 1). I needed to send 3 or 4 transactions to get J26JAN2 in my wallet.
2. The same J26JAN2, when I try to swap J26JAN0 for J26JAN2, I either get the error User Abort and error 429 in my wallet (screenshot 2) or I get a message about a successful transaction, but the swap does not occur and the balance of J26JAN0 and J26JAN2 does not change. I tried for about an hour, but I could not make this swap, the swap of J26JAN0 to J26JAN1 was successful and without problems. 
3. Often the swap button stops responding to a click - this is corrected by updating the page

+ The website design is nice and accessible for a newbie;
+ Camera scroll button works great, nothing is annoying, everything is smooth;
+ No bugs detected here.

2. MySwap: üí±
+ Transaction processing is fast enough on the SWAP tab;
+ MySwap has a pretty cool color interface;
- I had to wait longer for liquidity, but all in all it was ok;
- I had to press the cross to close the popup windows in the upper right corner, it didn‚Äôt work the first time, I had to press the cross a few times.

3. Mint Square: üñº

Hi, I have a question regarding the L1->L2 message cancellation mechanism:
If I understand correctly, there should be a way to reset cancellation request time of a message? i.e., resetting `l1ToL2MessageCancellations()[msgHash]`
https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/4e233516f52477ad158bc81a86ec2760471c1b65/src/starkware/starknet/eth/StarknetMessaging.sol#L158-L159

Otherwise for the same `msgHash`, the cancellation only has to be requested and cancelled once and all future cancellation can happens immediately.

It might be used maliciously to cancel other user's or dapp's message by sending-and-cancelling message in advance (perhaps by predicting possible/popular message params `(toAddress, selector, payload, nonce)` etc.

And if the message can be instantly cancelled, it would also become an DoS attacking surface.","",""

Completed the testnet.

1. Mintsquare. No errors, but nft appears on my account within 15 mins. It's long

2. Oasis. Not possible to interact with the app. Approves go fast, but doesn't allow to buy, sell or creats.

3. Briq. Everything goes smooth but a bit longer than it should be. I like the design and intuitively clear UIX. The last step of minting is still loading üò¶

4. MySwap. Didn't get why I cannot swap TST directly to tCOMP.

5. JediSwap. Cannot provide liquidity for a lot of pairs.

I want to report a number of errors and give a couple of tips.
1. The Briq site took a very long time to complete the transaction, as in all the steps of the crowding, but I understand it, the service was updated and many had it, so the transaction is hanging today. 
2. There was an error on this site when I visited, I did not allow the transaction to be carried out, I guessed to remove 1 part in the error itself by going to some site and everything worked.
3. The site itself was suspended for 3-5 minutes when I logged in, I also reloaded it 3 times
4. the Oasis website occurred, one main problem, NFT was bought for tokens and the transaction took 15-20 minutes, and I did not find NFT, I made 3 transactions and everything went by, 1 came the next day and the other did not come, but they hang in active, but I can't find for sale
5. the Mintsquare website also does not immediately pass the transaction, there are its own hangups
6. The mySwap site has a delay in the pool when you throw them there. 
7. The Jediswap website also had delays, but there is a minus in the mint, it did not allow you to screw up tokens at all, it turned out only 3 times

1- First of all, I rented a server to run testnet. I have successfully completed the node installation steps. (via CMD) However, when I wanted to leave CMD/close my connection from the server (ctrl c) it disconnected me from INFURA even though I downloaded all the blocks, so no reguest data came. 

2- I thought I made a mistake during the installation phase and I deleted the server and reinstalled it. (My only shortcoming is SCREEN -S Main Page) Node successfully communicated with INFURA. However, after a certain time/about 10 hours, I realized that he lost contact with INFURA again. I don't know if node was running in the background but the solution was that I needed to reach the server and start ""cargo run --release --bin pathfinder -- --ethereum.url https://mainnet.infura.io/ v3/****** It was because I ran the "" command. But it works when cmd is open, when I close it, communication is lost.

***So, what I want to mention briefly is that when I want to exit the virtual server, there is a lack of communication in the node. I recommend you to review, especially Requests.*** @STARK Team","",""

In the first test, the site and wallet gave these errors.

It was possible to load NFT onto StartNet itself.

The third test gave an error while loading.
And also under NFT does not correctly display the name of NFT.
And it produces an error as a result.

On the 4th test, everything is fine, the coins were exchanged.

In the last test it gives the following error.

All screenshots are attached.

Many have already said about the slow speed of transactions, but I think that this is only a temporary problem. The biggest problem for me is the frequent failure of transactions with the following reason: ""Sending transaction failed: Error: Request failed with status code 502"" . Because of this, many transactions have to be repeated 5 or more times. Functionality of all projects works fine)
I really believe in the future of the StarkNet and I hope that all these problems will be solved very easily and quickly!

Briq.construction have always status PENDING, but i can see my nft at playoasis. 
About playoasis - its impossible to create nft in a daytime, i also created only at night, button create just doesnt works when network is loaded.

What else... Jediswap always disconnect you or starting loading and the only thing you can make with it is only reload the page. 

Myswap is rather ok, Starkswap too, but i couldnt get faucet for 4 hours. 
 mySwap always send a notification ""Waiting for Starknet, try again later"". After few seconds you can click again and all works.

A bunch of erc721 on goerli do not return an error nor an output. They fail with http-502 on gateway (and voyager) and pathfinder. Here is an example:

```
export CONTRACT=0x05b96b19879576340a9fe56a58605e2dbf6cb3275b79f937d8ec4a7c7b3f71a5
starknet call --function tokenURI --inputs 1 0 --address $CONTRACT --abi ./erc721_abi.json

Got BadRequest while trying to access https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/call_contract?blockNumber=pending. Status code: 502; text:
<html><head>
<meta http-equiv=""content-type"" content=""text/html;charset=utf-8"">
<title>502 Server Error</title>
</head>
```

You can also test the tokenURI with 1 on voyager. Any idea why? Is it transient or an issue with the contract ? How can I diagnose that issue? 

Thank you","",""

**Hi everyone!

StarkNet Alpha 0.10.2 will be released to integration on this Wednesday, 02/11

- This version introduces sequencer parallelization! This is the first step in our roadmap of performance upgrades. Details about the specific mechanism of parallelization and the roadmap in general will be released in a post next week.
- A new endpoint, estimate_fee_bulk, is added to the feeder gateway. This will allow estimating the fee of several transactions at once, where each transaction is executed relative to the resulting state from applying the previous one.

Additionally, as a temporary measure to handle the load on testnet, we created a new testnet environment, testnet2, which is also based on Goerli. See the announcement for more details https://starkware.notion.site/Update-to-Core-Stars-on-StarkNet-s-performance-temporary-solutions-Oct-27-2022-4e2d8a73f1d048f2b9e284ef47d14564. StarkNet Testnet1 & Testnet2 are expected to upgrade to 0.10.2 one week after integration, Wednesday 9/11. Mainnet is expected to be released a week after testnets, on the 15'th.**

I noticed such an error on the network
For a long time, I've been following the project, decided to test the network, transferred it from the metamask to your network, everything turned out quickly and clearly
, but when I started to withdraw, I noticed that only the commission was debited and there was no transaction in the wallet. I started looking at the transaction in the scan and noticed that it was sent to the zero address, I was scared because the funds were not coming for a long time. I decided to check all transactions with the metamask and saw that when I replenished the network, the transaction also came from a null address, I do not know if it is your network's error or if it is a metamask error. I used the STARKGATE bridge , I will attach the hash of all transactions to the wallet address below and also screenshots
