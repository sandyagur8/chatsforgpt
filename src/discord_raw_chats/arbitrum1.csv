I have some feedback at the very end step:
1. we specificly require node v16 (my version of ubuntu targets v12)
2. If you bump into permission erros, check that the container can access the filesystem on the volume mount. most likely you created the ./config directory as `root`
lastly the steps to setup the rollup contracts simply say:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=""blah"" L2_RPC_URL=""https://bla..."" L3_RPC_URL=""http://blah..."" yarn run setup
```

I suspect might be missing instructions to first issue `yarn install` to install the node modules

secondly the command implies it's a 1 liner command, where as this actually needs to be more like:
```
export PRIVATE_KEY=""blah""
export L2_RPC_URL=""https://bla...""
export L3_RPC_URL=""http://blah..."" 
yarn run setup
```

since the script is expecting environment variables","","👍 (2)"

- Your biggest cost will be the sequencer posting the batches into the parent chain (L2). This cost will be a formula based on the computation costs of the transactions (L3) + cost of posting the batch on L2 + relative cost of posting the batch on L1 (small in its current state, if your batches aren't too big). 
- If you deploy an Anytrust Orbit chain, you will benefit from smaller batches to post on L2 (and, thus, a reduction in costs).
- Reducing the base fee too much opens up the possibility of users spamming your network.
- You can try to get some numbers by running a testnet orbit chain, execute some transactions and scale that to current activity you have in your dapp, so you'll be able to have a clearer image.","",""
