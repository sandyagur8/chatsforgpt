Only way to bridge an arbitrum native ERC20 (minted and burnt on arbitrum) to mainnet is to design a custom gateway right?

We are a protocol that will mint/burn our token on arbitrum itself with an option for users to move the token to mainnet
I think there will be other protocols like us as well

Should we make one custom gateway that all arbitrum native tokens use (just like most mainnet tokens are going to use the ERC20Gateway)

L2 base price + cost to submit to l1 goes to aggregator if there is one (otherwise straight to Ethereum miners). ArbOS collects the 15% fee.

Then on the main page of the explorers they transform everything into arbgas, i.e. by using the L1 costs and the arbgas cost they can calculate how much arbgas the L1 fees correspond to. This means doing the same transaction with the same L1 costs might take a completely different amount of arbgas if the arbgas price changed a lot.","","üëç (1)"

translating the advanced txinfo into gas values (btw, you should do this in the explorer, the ETH value is close to useless IMO):

L1 calldata paid = 1175k gas
L2 computational used = 10k gas
L2 storage paid = 1200k gas","",""
"283445391721234432","roshanroshan","30/10/2021 11:42 am","1. what exactly is the L1 fixed cost? one of my txs from over a month ago has the same cost, so I'm guessing its just an arbitrary number but would love to know what its tracking - is it simply cost of l1 tx (21k eth gas equivalent) spread among l2 tx? assuming there was only 1 tx in the worst case, this means a factor of at least 20x
2. how is the l1 calldata paid computed? a normal transfer around the same time has a calldata cost of 184k gas, and the above tx has ~650 bytes of calldata extra, so it seems like its 184k base + ~15 gas per byte of calldata (if the method of computing is even correct)
3. computational gas is fine (only coz its negligible in the grand scheme of things üòÖ), though something like the ethereum yellow paper with gas costs listed would be appreciated
4. the above tx uses 6 slots, let's assume all zero to non-zero, this means 200k gas per storage slot, which is roughly 10x the gas cost on eth. Since most contract interactions are limited by storage anyway, this means the gas price shown on the explorer needs to be marked up by roughly 10x to be compared with eth gas prices, and most likely 20-50x given the other costs and txs might not actually spend that much on storage. 
5. Given this, and correct me if I'm wrong here, I estimate its currently only about 2-5x cheaper than mainnet which doesn't really seem worth it (caveat: I'll be measuring specifically for my use case later, might turn out to be much cheaper ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

As soon as the sequencer (or any aggregator, or yourself) posts your tx on chain (and you wait for L1 finality) then everyone knows that it's part of the canonical transaction chain. The data is ordered and available in the L1. Anyone running a node knows that is the correct order of executing the tx in their node.

Then there is the question if this correct order and execution will be enforced by the rollup / dispute resolution protocol.

If the 2 parties trust at least 1 of the validators taking part in the protocol (that they will enforce the correct outcome), then it's safe to assume that the finality takes the time for your batch being posted in the L1 and the time to finality they usually expect in the L1.

How can I list transactions that have been confirmed by the sequencer? And what are the chances that some of those transactions are not included in the rollup in L1? I am working on a real-time price chart product and currently, it only shows the price update after the block number is stamped (which is after the L1 rollup has been done). I am wondering that since the tx confirmation in Arbitrum is so fast, so the chart should be as fast as the tx confirmation time.

```
The Arbitrum protocol's usage of L2 Aliases for L1-to-L2 messages prevents cross-chain exploits that would otherwise be possible if we simply reused L1 contact addresses.
```

Curious about the scenarios that were in mind for this. Is the basic idea that if a L2 contract defines logic around the external contract being a L1 contract that executes a call via a cross-chain tx then without address aliasing in certain scenarios it would be possible to use create2 to deploy the same L1 contract code on L2 at the same address using create2? And then, that new contract could directly call the L2 contract which might result in problems if the L2 contract was expecting that call to be from L1?

I see a possible frontrunning / MEV opportunity but there's a few sub questions to get there:
1. I can use the L1 delayed inbox to force-include txs into L2 myself (no sequencer needed) but there's a ~10min delay for the normal sequencer to get priority to settle L2 txs on L1. That sequencer priority treatment prevents any rando on L1 from ""stealing my highly perishable Uniswap L2 trade"" and replace it by their own txs (MEV) which gets force included. Correct?
2. There's a max ~10min time delay between L2 fees being paid to the sequencer and the sequencer paying the L1 fees themselves and that presents an market risk in terms of L1 gas prices to the sequencer, correct?
3. In that case what does the sequencer do in terms of HIGHLY and suddenly increasing L1 base fees (say yet another NFT drop). Does the sequencer absorb the cost to keep the 10min cadence or does it delay L1 settlement and therefore time intervals between L1 anchorings (maybe I made up that word?) are > 10min.
4. In case of the latter, some L1 users could have huge MEV opportunities by replacing profitable L2 txs retrospectively. Correct?","",""

Sorry for the maybe dumb question, but I struggle with something:
How do I find, on the L1 (therefore ETH) blockchain the transaction that is at the origin of some movement on the L2 blockchain ?

I tried looking for the address on the ETH blockchain, but it does not exist, neither does the address with the alias undone (removing the 0x111100...001111 offset).

Here: https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/rollup_protocol it is stated that, in the event that the dispute resolution process is needed due to stakes on conflicting DAs, each staker is only involved in one challenge at a time, and moreover that who each staker is paired against for the challenge is just a matter of someone issuing a transaction that points to two stakers not currently in challenges that disagree (rather than there being some sort of random selection process or something). So it seems like in the worst case an attacker could stake one deposit on an incorrect outcome and n deposits on the current outcome using different addresses. Then there will only ever be one challenge at a time, as there is only the one stake that disagrees with the others, so honest participants can‚Äôt really get in on a ""feeding frenzy"". However, the attacker could conceivably pay enough gas so that the incorrect DA is paired against one of her other malicious stakes for n periods in a row, causing the stake with the right answer to nonetheless lose for example by timing out during the interactive verification game. She loses n*(the burned half of the stake + gas), so she averages a cost of stake/2+gas per period of delay she causes. Is that a fair assessment?

We currently run our own geth nodes to verify transactions (incoming and outgoing) to credit or debit customers. 

I've read the documentation around setting up an Arb node, but not really sure that would be sufficient to prove that a Transaction pertaining to one of our customer addresses is final on-chain. 

I've also tried to follow a transaction from arbiscan to see how / where it is then finalized on the main ETH chain, but struggling to find that data transfer anywhere. 

A simple example of what I would need to see and verify before crediting a customer on the exchange is:
1) that there is a TX on arb chain that credits that address with x ETH
2) possibly run my own fraud proof on that TX to make sure that the tx is valid
3) wait for the tx to be ""finalised"" on layer 1 (this is the part im not able to verify manually at the moment)

any help or a point in the right direction would be appreciated","",""

I am collecting these data for a study comparing performances of EVM compatible blockchains.
I have a few questions regarding the Arbitrum blockchain properties in terms of scalability, decentralization, and security.

Could you please provide me with some answers on the below questions:
1.    Scalability: How many transactions per second (TPS) can Arbitrum process?
2.    Decentralization: How many nodes (validators) is there for the Arbitrum blockchain network?
3.    Security: As I can‚Äôt find any other metric to measure security; What is the cost to attack the Arbitrum blockchain?

Thank you in advance.","",""
"781046902665379860","JasonWan#9935","10/02/2022 8:54 pm","Hi,
1. The tps of arbitrum depends on ethereum because every tx on l2 its tx calldata will record on l1.
2. Arbitrum is rollups protocol so it is a 1/n model which means only if there is a honest validator on this work and even though others validator are cheater, this network can still be safe.
3. As for the security, the security of l2 is based on l1, because every tx calldata needs to be recorded on l2, and the state is decided once the tx calldata recorded, this is because every honest node can read from l1, and compute those tx calldata and get the correct state.","",""

1. Does it mean that the Arbitrum processed TPS is around 14 TPS like Ethereum? That seems very low. I thought Arbitrum had about 40k TPS
2. Thanks for your comment. Do you know where I can find the number of validators on Arbitrum?
3. I believe this means Arbitrum is as secure as Ethereum? i.e. the cost of attacking Arbitrum is about the same as attacking Ethereum?","",""
"781046902665379860","JasonWan#9935","11/02/2022 9:34 am","Hi, 
1. Nope, the tps on l1 is 14 is because ethereum will execute those tx, however, for rollups, only need record tx calldata on l1 and execute it off chain, this will huge increase tps.
2. Currently offchainlabs run the validators but we will open it later.
3. Arbitrum‚Äôs security is very close to ethereum( because hackers might hack our sequencers, but due to users can still send tx via l1 directly so it‚Äôs not so serious) and is much higher than side chain or plasma scales method.","","üëç (1)"

I think this is the relevant config

2. Would it be possible to point me towards an example use of the `transferExitAndCall` method?
3. Is there a recommended way to check if the exit has been triggered? Also what would be the outcome of `transferExitAndCall` if the exit is already triggered?

However, I have another question: how do you charge users for the pubdata bytes? 

The price for L1 calldata may not really correlate with the L2 speed limit usage. I am really interested in how L2 arbgas price is formed and how the system makes sure that the operator is never undepaid in highly volatiel L1 gas market. Thanks!","",""

We considered an option to use `CustomGateway`, but in our case, it will require users to wrap tokens before the transfer cause our token is not upgradable on L1 and doesn't implement the `IArbToken` interface. Additional wrapping is not good from the UX perspective, and we would like to avoid it. Looks like the best option for us is a gateway developed by ourselves and integrated into the token bridge, as it has done for DAI and Livepeer tokens. Can we use such an option? As I understood, this will allow us to implement bridging without additional wrapping and take control of the L2 token proxy with the ability to upgrade implementation in the future by ourselves. Also, it brings some benefits, like the ability to implement pausing for L1 to L2 transfers, which we probably would like to have.","",""

After a long brainstorming phase with my Research Supervisor, we‚Äôve chosen Arbitrum to represent the category of ‚ÄúOptimistic Rollups‚Äù.

I‚Äôm trying to retrieve as much data as I can, but I‚Äôm having a bit of problems in finding out information about sequencers and aggregators. Here‚Äôs my problem: is there a way to retrieve data (via APIs or other resources) of available sequencer(s) and aggregator(s) and the associated transactions volumes? Also, it‚Äôs not clear to me how many of these nodes are actually there.

Any information or advice would be really useful.

1. apart from sequencer, all other nodes' state is derived by running all the txs in the inbox in the order they appear
2. sequencer gets and executes all the tx in FIFO basis and every tx is executed or rejected instantly. it has its own state, not all of these txs that sequencer executes and confirms would be on the chain yet. sequencer publishes all the txs that went directly to the sequencer periodically back to the chain
3. sequencer can execute all the txs without publishing on the chain because it has special power over ordering, it is possible for the txs to go directly on chain but they will be the ""delayed"" inbox, i.e. the sequencer will interleave these txs in its ordering with a delay of 10 minutes
4. nodes that we run are forwarder nodes, they forward everything they get to the sequencer.
5. do forwarder nodes relay all the requests to the sequencer to get and query the latest state? or is forwarder node always behind by the delay at which the new state root gets published on the chain?
6. currently there is only one sequencer that offchainlabs runs and the ordering is FIFO?

In this article https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec is stated that

> If the sequencer node stops adding transactions to the sequencer inbox, anyone can force the sequencer inbox to include transactions from the delayed inbox via a smart contract function call. This allows the Arbitrum network to always be available and resistant to a malicious sequencer.

Is this the only reason why there are two different smart contracts for doing basically the same thing? And if so, how Arbitrum is resistant to a malicious sequencer thanks to this forwarding of messages? Thank you in advance for your patience.","",""

```
A challenge begins with only two segments (a degree of one), which is the asserter's initial assertion. Then, the bisection game begins on the challenger's turn. In each round of the game, the current responder must choose an adjacent pair of segments to challenge. By doing so, they are disputing their opponent's claim that starting with the first segment and executing for the specified distance (number of steps) will result in the second segment. At this point the two parties agree on the correctness of the first segment but disagree about the correctness of the second segment. The responder must provide a bisection with a start segment equal to the first segment, but an end segment different from the second segment. In doing so, they break the challenge down into smaller distances, and it becomes their opponent's turn. Each bisection must have degree min(40, numStepsInChallengedSegment), ensuring the challenge makes progress.
```
in this paragraph breaking down the challenge process, it seems to imply that the responder my arbitrarily slice the bisection into another bisection (I think the final statement in the paragraph touches on minimum requirements on slicing). why not just force everyone to provide a proof of the middle of some bisection each time?","",""

My question centers around the notion that if Arbitrum has a 7-day finality, and if the tokens for the bridge transfer has been in the source wallet for less than 7 days, then isnt there some risk, however minute, that those tokens may become invalid due to a fraud proof submitted after the transfer?  For example, suppose Alice, with the help of a malicious validator, double spent her AETH - she sent 5 AETH to Bob and also shortly after sent the same 5AETH to her L1 address.  The bridge makes the transfer by adding to the pool on L2 and remove from the pool on L1.  However, at a later time if a fraud proof is submitted for the 5AETH that never should have been in Alice's wallet, then we have a problem.

We're trying to deploy on Arbitrum testnet, but keep getting this error:
ProviderError: transaction ran out of gas

This is weird because sometimes it's happening and sometimes it does not.
Here is what we tried doing:
1. add the `gas` hardhat setting with `1e9` which is wayyy more than needed
2. add the `gasMultiplier` hardhat setting with `2` which is wayyy more than needed
3. Although out contract is very small, we also tried using `allowUnlimitedContractSize` set to `true`. But we also saw that regular transactions and not even deployments are failing with this error.

This leads us to believe it has nothing to do with our settings, and maybe something is wrong on the network itself?

 I understand how users can circumvent a malicious sequencer censoring transactions by 'forcing' the transaction into the inbox after a 24hr waiting period. 

What are the assurances  about getting messages out of the L2? I read here (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/arbos/Geth.md#mixdigest-and-extradata) that ArbOS's merkleaccumulator is stored in the mixdigest and extradata field of each L2 block. So the outbox entries are part of the fraud-proof game right? The L2->L1 message passing read.me docs (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/master/docs/L1_L2_Messages.md#l2-to-l1-messages-lifecycle) state that ""ArbOS gathers all outgoing messages, Merklizes them, and publishes the root as an OutboxEntry in the chain's outbox. Note that this happens ""automatically"".

How exactly does this happen 'automatically'? It's kind of opaque for me to trace the mainnet beta transactions to the outbox. I looks like this transaction (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x99ea51b5d088fe7c68a42aea99066cebfe7a18f37145444f3a16e126c554892b#eventlog) makes an outbox entry (in addition to many other transactions to the rollup contract and others). The transaction is coming ultimately from an EOA, '0xddffdaf55326b9765a2e69ebf0e6dca11ae669cd'.

Can someone share some insight about how the outbox entry is made? Thanks ~ üôè","",""

The ""mempool""  is dictated by the gas limit and computational limits of the single threaded sequencer node. Block sizes can be arbitrarily large so by having a hard gas limit, this also caps the block size.

However if an adversary wanted to spam transactions to the sequencer at incrementally higher fees (second price fee mechanism allows for more efficient floor spamming prices), what's stopping them from doing that?

There should always be enough ETH (or other assets) to bridge back no (in=out)? Unless ofc there is a minting bug that lets you mint. Is it a correct statement to say that 3rd party bridges inherently give a systemic risk factor to the Layer 2?
and is the native arbi bridge by definition the most safe? or is i.e. a nomad (optimistic bridge with fraud proofs) safer?
are there bridges that let you personnaly give you a right to always bridge back? as in you are the only address that can bridge back with the same bridge you used, and that ETH is reserved for you on L1?","",""

"699608154454884382",".sarva","13/07/2022 3:50 pm","Let me try to explain my confusion
1. `depositEth` is called by a user wanting to deposit L1 ETH to Arbitrum. 
     Link to `depositEth` code https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Inbox.sol#L220

2. `depositEth` calls `_deliverMessage` which in turn calls `deliverToBridge` which calls `bridge.deliverMessageToInbox`
       Link to `deliverMessageToInbox` in `Bridge.sol` https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Bridge.sol#L58

3. `deliverMessageToInbox` calls `addMessageToInbox` which pushes a new hash value into the `inboxAccs` array.
 Link to relevant code.  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-eth/contracts/bridge/Bridge.sol#L97

4. The L1 part of `depositEth` **seems** to end with step 3 described above. There has to be some action on L2 which mints the L2 ETH. Something like the method `L2ArbitrumGateway.finalizeInboundTransfer`. This seems to apply to ERC20. I couldn't find an analogous ETH method.
   Link to relevant code:  https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/blob/05bd0a4bf15d25b99fce21640ddd8fc734a65a78/packages/arb-bridge-peripherals/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/gateway/L2ArbitrumGateway.sol#L228

5. The L1 transaction finalization time applies to the `depositEth` (IIUC). But shouldn't the L2 finalization time apply to the L2 action that mints the L2 ETH? If the L2 ETH minting is an L2 transaction, then it could be done incorrectly and be subject to a fault proof. Am I missing something here?","",""

I basically want to calculate the amount of gas that would be spent for an Arbitrum transaction if the transaction was instead sent on L1.


For example, consider these two transactions. Both approve MAGIC token. One on Arbitrum, one on L1.

https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x2f35d7eac86381f0e9bffaa568b547a79c0e64ee2cf2273c4c74a0e40dc7245d

Arbitrum transaction has spent 1516 computational arbgas.
Ethereum transaction has spent 51,922 - 21,000 = 30,922 gas.

How do I convert the Arbitrum gas to Ethereum gas? Or at least estimate it? Is it possible? I've been working on this for ages and I'd really appreciate some help.","",""

2. In the medium article, the offchain lab encouraged the gaming and social applications to build on top of Arbitrum Nova. Is Defi applications also recommended to build on top of Nova?

As an example, here is a `redeem()` tx, which executes a `distribute()` tx:

* redeem: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xe896b16b635ed76c0b67e275970c581483baf081dc3556007853443c6467e6a9

My understanding is that the `L1 calldata price` is `16` (cost for L1 calldata) multiplied by the current L1 `gasPrice`, `x`. My understanding of the `L1 calldata size` would just be the `redeem_calldata.length() + distribute_calldata.length()`, or  `37 + 198 = 235`. Given both of those, I'd imagine the final solution would be `(x 16 * x * 235`.

When doing these calculations for those transactions, however, things are not lining up. Is my understanding of those values correct?","",""

we are intentionally failing the auto-redeem and we have a worker set up to redeem the ticket once it gets created. I'd be happy to talk through that design if you want üôÇ

I'd be happy to get a broader picture of which part will be decentralized and how the incentives would work.

Clearly there needs to be someone who decides on the L1 inbox, and also pay for the gas costs of populating the inbox. So what will the incentives be, and how is frontrunning avoided?

Similarly for validators, can multiple validators stake on the same block? how do they cover the gas costs of staking actions?","",""

So how will this works with multiple sequencers? Won't they be competing with each other on who puts the txs on L1? What if a sequencer puts a tx that has already been broadcast by someone else? Is it simply ignored?
If/when validators whitelist is removed, will it make sense for >1 validator to stake on a block?
On one hand, if there is an incentive to do so, then all should stake, but his will lead to many txs on L1.
On the other hand, if staking is limited to only one validator per block, there there is a race to who stakes on it first.

> 1) **DAC Is a previously chosen close permissioned quorum**. The reason is that if you add unknown members and many go offline they turn the system to fully on-chain data one. Which defeats the purpose of anytrust. With PU one can be more permissive with who can become a PU. In the worst case they‚Äôd join and then be withdrawn if they don‚Äôt function. Asking for a deposit to cover that cost makes it an easier case.
> 
> 2) In the case some DAC members don‚Äôt sign all batch data goes on chain. In the case where some PUs don‚Äôt sign their withdrawal data goes on-chain (so different data in those cases)
> 
> 3) **Trust level in anytrust is that DAC can steal all funds. This is worse than Validium (DAC can freeze the funds) and both are worse than Adamantium (where users can be fully trustless)**
> 
> 4) Anytrust is described for a general purpose rollup. Adamantium here is described for app specific use case. There can be a validity rollup with the same mechanism as anytrust, and Adamantium can be expended to a general logic, but this is not what is being described here. It requires more thought.","",""

- How do validators compute the state of the rollup if they don't have access to transaction data (since sequencers won't publish it to L1 as calldata)? 

The classic rollup protocol allows nodes to check the validity of state updates (by comparing final state roots). 

But if Nova nodes can't access transaction data (and compute the new state), how can they know if the sequencer is processing invalid transactions, and initiate a fraud proof?

- What is the difference between a Layer 2 Nitro block (I assume this is produced by the sequencer) and an ""RBlock""? This question is mostly related to the Arbitrum One protocol, though.","",""

The block you see from arbiscan is built by sequencer, and it is almost same as ethereum l1 block, also, if you call rpc service, the block information you get is also this type block.

How can I calculate L1 calldata cost? Is it simply the same as regular calldata cost on Mainnet (4 gas for zero bytes, 16 gas for non-zero bytes)? I'm so confused and my whole application is broken (my fault) but, I'd really appreciate some help, thanks! üôÇ","",""

But how do validators add new Rblocks to L1?

Then the other question is related to the AnyTrust chains:

- When does the chain revert to a rollup? In places, it says this happens if the sequencer cannot get a DA Certificate from the DAC. But I also saw in another section that the same thing happens if there's a challenge. It'd be great if you can explain this part. Thanks.","",""

* Being a validator is currently whitelisted, so I understand s not possible to try for yourself. Is there a like to an onchain fraud-proof from start to finish? (goerli or mainnet), it is much easier to follow the process with an exmple.
* How much stake does a validator need to put on each batch? How much does the challenger? Is this likely to change in the future?
* Does every step (bisection) of the dispute require an additional stake that can be lost?
* Can there be more than one challenger to a batch during the dispute period?
* During the proof process, does the contract need access to the compressed transaction sequence to know which transaction should be executed at the final step?

* What happens if the sequencer publish an invalid transaction? e.g, a tx without a nonce? Alternatively,  if the compression algorithm creates a batch that is published incorrectly (e.g. cosmic ray bit flip), and this batch cannot be decrypted? is it the tx/batch ignored?","",""

After downloading the archive snapshot for Arbitrum Classic, what are the tags needed to run an archive node? I'm using the docker image: `offchainlabs/arb-node:v1.4.5-e97c1a4`

I'd noticed after downloading and extracting the latest db-archive.tar (with data up to July of this year), the directory size is larger than my own ""archive"" directory with data up to August, by at least 200GB... which tells me I must not have been properly running an archive node.

I'm using the following flags:

I have a question about gas prices and how to calculate the gas cost (in ETH) for a given transaction. My questions is a little bit about how 2D fees work exactly. I read https://developer.offchainlabs.com/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#fees, but I don't quite understand how to calculate it. If I calculate the estimated gas + the gas price by calling the RPC, do I just do `gasPrice * estimatedGas` and that would be it? Is that enough? Or do I need to do something else?

In my previous experience with Optimism, I had to calculate both l1Gas and l2Gas, but I'm not sure if I need to so the same here","",""

That explains why the total gasUsed is equal to the gasUsedForL1:

Does that sound correct? Will a tx I send ever be limited by the gasLimit? This tx  `0x94ef9efcc35210093ae4f8ee59f4b4772bc5a04ba92e870fd3593dadabf0c5d6` on goerli arbitrum used 492,116,711 gas, which seems to point to this being true, but would love some clarifiaction.","","üëç (1)"

"222387580564406273","lucas.santoni","23/11/2022 3:10 pm","Hello! I was taking a look at the transaction history of an address I came across, and I'm confused with how bridge transfers of ETH between L1 and L2 are represented.

* L1 deposit: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfb7a3ef269c851025dfa2d83408eb2e1bfd27eb2630f46926a1ee924f965eb8b

The L1 part makes sense to me, but the L2 part does not. Indeed the transaction seems to be withdrawal. The deposit ETH amount goes *from* `0xdae2ad9b0df4397bbafcdd3eabb15fca627a1be6` *to* the `ArbRetryableTx` address.

I would have expected the funds to go *from* the `ArbRetryableTx` address *to* `0xdae2ad9b0df4397bbafcdd3eabb15fca627a1be6`.

Is there anything I'm missing here? Thanks for your help!

"566997415807156224","legape","01/12/2022 6:30 pm","Hey everyone. I am trying to integrate Arbitrum SDK into my protocol. 
I am wondering if there is any specific reason why the SDK still uses the versions 5.1.x of the `ethers`  npm package (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk/blob/main/package.json#L47-L52). 
Do you plan to upgrade this dependency to the latest version at some point?

The issue i am facing: 
I am trying to incorporate your SDK inside a multi SDK system where we use the latest ethers version = 5.7.x. Everything should work logic-wise however i am struggling to get the typescript compiler satisfied since ethers 5.1.x and 5.7.x hold slightly different Provider & Signer type definitions.

Thank you!","","üëç (2)"

From what I understand, `l2CallValue` is the amount of ETH that would be bridged from Ethereum to Arbitrum.
So it's not used to pay for bridging right? The amount used to pay is `msg.value` ?

I'm using this kind of implementation: 
```
    uint256 _ticketID = inbox.createRetryableTicket{ value: msg.value }(
      address(executor),
      0,
      _maxSubmissionCost,
      msg.sender,

      _gasLimit,
      _gasPriceBid,
      _data
    );

1. it is used for proving only
2. it is called only by validators.
3. how is it called? Are they some test files in Nitro repo, that calls the compiled WAVM? I suppose it is only called offchain? 
4. Is WAVM called only during the Execution Challenge, after Block Challenge, correct? 
5. is challenge_manager.go used for both execution or proving? If execution, why and how is it used? If proving only, why is it not written in rs directly, but rather go?

Can anybody help me with hardhat ?

I have setup my own dev server and also connected metamask to it, and i can see the test Eth on the arbitrum side...

I have the following config in hardhat, should this work ?

```

    arbitrum: {
      url: ""http://localhost:8547"",

I get the following

```

Will keep it short and sweet. After a --detach I was issuing a ```docker compose down```, this caused an issue and subsequent running of the chain.

Some days ago you told me that I can retrieve the l2 block range from the batch being appended in the tx from the sequencer to the inbox (in the rollup). As I understand, since the nitro release, I can get the batches involved in the rollup doing that. 

But what about the rollups pre nitro? How can I retrieve the block range or count when the tx is from the sequencer to the old inbox?

For classic batch search, it hard to do it with nitro node, you may need to use classic node which will provide you this. However, you can also call eth_getTransactionReceipt to get `l1BlockNumber`, although this value is not where the batch tx recorded, but it can give you a vague number (About what this value is, you can see https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time#ethereum-block-numbers-within-arbitrum).","",""

I would assume if the L1 inbox was being used (i.e. relay was bad) I would see the `inbox` messages over the `created block` message?

I'm trying to `eth_estimateGas` for a transaction on Arbitrum. But my call reverts because I have other transactions that need to occur first before this one. So normally, I would use `debug_traceCall` to override the necessary EVM state to get the transaction to simulate successfully. But the output from `debug_traceCall` always specifies a constant, 20M, for `gasUsed`, which is incorrect.

For context, I'm building an application similar to Chainlink's randomness oracle. A user makes a request for some offchain service and also pays for the gas cost of the eventual callback, which delivers the response onchain. I need to estimate the txn fee of the callback before I make the request. This would be straightforward but simulating the callback fails without giving necessary state overrides.

So, I need another way or formula to calculate the ""gasLimit"" ... any ideas?","",""

But I want to solve for the simpler, low latency case and I‚Äôd prefer to not overcharge the user too much‚Ä¶ my goal is to create something simple that works, then observe it and refine the gas prediction algorithm over time. Furthermore, if the network surges, my users would most likely be ok with waiting 5 - 10 minutes rather than chasing the surge price if that makes sense.

1. it appears the original transaction failed and then they attempted to resubmit the same transaction again the next day.
2. I'm not seeing the error thrown in Arbiscan, not sure if this tx was not indexed properly. But my guess, looking at it, since it's just a basic ETH transfer, it looks like it's related to the nonce used on the transaction (47). Typically nonces start at 0 and increment from there and setting a nonce too high from where you're at can cause a failure. 
3. yes, all duplicated transactions will fail. once a nonce has been used for an address that transaction cannot be valid again. 
4. the EVM will automatically detect dupes and fail them. under what context do you need to detect them? 
5. if you're running a validator as normal, there's no need to handle them. they simply revert.","",""

Then reversion happens and this tx will disappear and I lost L2 tokens, but my L1 token is still locked.
And there is not retryable ticket anymore.

It seems same as if there is not retryable ticket. How you solve this problem with retryableTicket?","",""

So for ""safety"", validators run wavm using wavm jit machine, even though STF can be run natively(native architecture) when there is no dispute. Is this right?
I think native run(not executing wavm) can be done because assertion check is only done using state root, not the intermediate state of STF. Validators can post assertions by just running STF natively. Is this correct?
Also, can you clarify ""safety""? I think it is more safe because normal execution environment is much closer when dispute has occured, both in wavm. Also, by always executing in Wavm, it provides determinism between every instructions(Not required when no dispute. Validators will only compare assertion state not intermediate state).","",""

The thing you may have to watch out for with smart contract interactions is signing approvals for tokens.

You can check for approvals you've granted on Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker and revoke your approvals there. 

Usually the only way a private key is exposed is by a user copying it into some web app that's asking for it (no one should ever ask you for it) or by sharing a screenshot of a seed phrase (one method that phishers often use).

> Every L2 node creates blocks from incoming messages. It reads those messages from both the L1 Ethereum inbox and the off-chain sequencer feed (if they disagree it favors the L1 Ethereum inbox). Those messages can consist of things like a signed transaction. Nodes will then validate the signature, make sure the source account has enough ether to pay for it, etc. and determine the output state via the state transition function, creating a block in the process.
> 
> Deciding which L2 block to trust without running an L2 full node is tricky if it hasn't been confirmed on L1 yet. This isn't just true for Arbitrum, generally speaking, the best security is from full nodes instead of light clients. It's theoretically possible to build an L2 light client, but I'm not aware of any that exist yet. For now though, you could check reputable sources that run L2 full nodes themselves like Arbiscan, Alchemy, and Infura as a middle ground if you don't want to run an L2 full node yourself.

Does L2 have any Sybil protection mechanism then?  If so, what is the purpose of the L2 chain if it cannot be trusted at all and every node needs to execute the STF locally anyways? Would it not make more sense to just wait for a validator to publish and assert to an RBlock directly instead? Or are there any advantages to the L2 blocks?","",""

- You can find the formula to calculate the gas here => https://medium.com/offchainlabs/understanding-arbitrum-2-dimensional-fees-fd1d582596c9

- And here you have an example in TS on how to query the NodeInterface if you wish to do so => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-tutorials/blob/master/packages/delayedInbox-l2msg/scripts/normalTx.js#L35-L49

- About the ArbGasInfo precompile, getL1BaseFeeEstimate() will give you an estimate of the L1 base fee you will pay as part of your L2 transaction fees. This takes into account the batching and compression of your data that happens in Arbitrum. For a better estimation, you can use ArbGasInfo.getPricesInWei(), which will give you all gas data you need. For the L1 part, you have the second value returned which will give you the fees to be paid for each byte of data of your transaction => https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/contracts/src/precompiles/ArbGasInfo.sol#L34-L44 .

I've been using that hot wallet for basically almost 2 years for all kinds of stuff, especially for early participation in new L2's and other EVM chains.

With the last airdrop from blur on mainnet i realized that i will have likely returning episodes of PTSD whenever i would have been eliglible for future airdrops of any kind....
Which would honestly take much fun out of playing around with early stage networks, like i did when arbitrum launched.

Is there any possible way we can find, to remove the old wallet from any potential snapshots/lists/records regarding your governance token distribution and maybe even transfer the eligibility to a wallet i have secured access to?

Clients are now sorted by nonce target instead of nonce hash, and your nonce score must be as good or better than your nonce target. The nonce score is basically 256 - log2(nonceHash). The trick is that the nonce target is part of the preimage of the hash, so you can't just set the target to the score you get. This avoids a situation where, in the process of mining the best hash, you also find the top 25 hashes and can fill those slots

What does `gasleft()` on Arbitrum include exactly? the whole whatever gas is left for L1 and L2 right? 
Is there a way how I could reserve an amount of gas e.g. to make sure an event can be emitted? 
E.g. on L1, given that I estimate I need max 15k gas to emit the event etc., I can do 
`require(gasleft() > 15000, ""OUT OF GAS"")` 
But does that work the same way on Arbitrum? I know gas should not be hardcoded, on Ethereum because of potential changes in gas cost per opcode, but on Arbitrum it would even depend on L1 gas cost, so it's always dynamic?","",""

To my understanding it is possible to create a custom token on L1 and L2 and register them to the custom gateway.

However, the L1 token does not have that function, so I can only send L2 tokens to L1 if there are some tokens in the L1 escrow.

It did this by connecting to the sequencer feed directly at wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed instead of going through a node.

I am doing some experiments with it again, but I now get HTTP 429, which is normally an error message for having too many connections open / rate limiting. This doesn't make sense to me, as I have only tried to open one connection here afaik (I tried it like 10 times to see if the error would change but it was doing it from the first, and never even got 1 connection to work).

Describe the bug
Running into the same issue as #1410, namely node will not start with err=""no --init.* mode supplied and chain data not in expected directory"", after downloading the snapshot.

From what I gather from #1410 this is the issue with the hosted snapshot, wondering if there is a way to get the genesis db snapshot and start the node?

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Run docker command from the docs with 
`docker run -d  -v /root/.arbitrum:/home/user/.arbitrum --log-opt max-size=10m  -p 0.0.0.0:8547:8547 -p 0.0.0.0:8548:8548 offchainlabs/nitro-node:v2.0.11-8e786ec --l1.url http://xxx:6666 --l2.chain-id=42161 --http.api=net,web3,eth,debug --http.corsdomain=* --http.addr=0.0.0.0 --http.vhosts=* --init.url=""file:///home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar""`

/home/user/.arbitrum/nitro.tar Has been downloaded from https://snapshot.arbitrum.io/mainnet/db.tar [660G]

Expected behavior
Node starts up and starts syncing

For a **hard finality** you would wait for the Sequencer to post the batch on L1, although that may take a few minutes (in contrast with the soft finality, which is almost instant). Most dApps use the soft finality which is instant by relying on the Sequencer feed for keeping track of finalisation.

We had some issues recently with gas estimation on Arbitrum Goerli...

I have a flow where eth_estimateGas gets called twice:

1. The first time with just to, from (data and value are both 0), which returns a gas value
2. The second time it's the identical request but it includes the gas value

It looks like the second request is erroring with:
gas required exceeds allowance (81624)


This was a noop (0 value sent to self) in case that matters. Should I be providing a higher figure on a call than what's returned from eth_estimateGas?","",""

Maybe it is impossible to do via smart contracts? Im looking to feed the results of eth_getProof for a given storage slot inside L1 verification smart contract, thus proving that certain slot had certain value at this height of the L2. The only thing that has to do with state roots that I found is the GlobalState but it has to do with RBlocks. Is there an equivalent for `eth_getProof` for RBlocks - something that can give me the Merkle Tree branch for a given storage slot based on the state_root posted inside the RBlock?
Some context: I am working on https://ethresear.ch/t/wisp-zk-based-cross-rollup-communication-protocol/15059/5 and ideally we would like to integrate the Cross Rollup Communication protocol with Arbitrum. For that we need to prove inside the destination rollup that the L1 knows what the state of Arbitrum is and that certain storage slot is part of it. Hence the question.

Let's assume I'm selling a real-world item to someone and they send me a payment on Arbitrum. As the recipient of the payment, if I'm happy with trusting the Arbitrum system and the sequencer, is it enough for me to see the transaction in a block produced by the sequencer to consider it final (ie. to hand over the item)? I guess there's nothing the user can do at this point to revert the transaction on L2 (and I'm trusting the rest of the system anyway). Is there still a way I could not get the money (for example by the user ""double spending"" by triggering an exit on L1, which will be executed before the L2 block gets finalised)? Would be great if anybody could give me some more insight on this. I've read a lot about finality related to L2 transactions, but it's mostly from the perspective of the sender of the transaction.

The Sequencer orders transactions, so once a transaction is ""ordered"" (i.e., processed by the Sequencer and placed in the Inbox), it will be executed before any other transaction that comes afterwards.

Just have some questions about the validators.
As I see in the documentation, only whitelisted wallets can become a validator.

0xf1b4855aa312996e03e9df92834b9a24cf88c974abca95f8c68b16c47e0967b4

I wanted to share with you a cool project that I believe could make your community even better.  We've created a social platform called OpenCord that's perfect for DAOs. It's like Discord, but way cooler and more community-friendly. With OpenCord, you can discuss, propose, and vote on ideas all in one place, with seamless integration with DApps and DAO tools.  OpenCord is web3-native, which means you can connect with your Web3 identity and use your wallet to access exclusive content. Plus, we have support for NFT collections, POAPs, and more!  OpenCord is also super user-friendly, with no complex bots to configure. And best of all, it's multi-platform, so you can access it from anywhere, on any device.  We're really excited about this project and would love to chat with you more about it. You can find us at https://opencord.xyz.  Looking forward to hearing back from you soon!","",""

github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/arbitrum_types: cannot find module providing package github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/arbitrum_types
github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/arbos imports
        github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/precompilesgen: cannot find module providing package github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/solgen/go/precompilesgen

any idea how to resolve these issues?","",""

Sequencer is just picking txs, ordering them and send them on-chain. So the output for sequencer feed is the ordered txs. Arb nodes when receive data from sequencer feed, will calculate the outcome locally. 
Also Arb nodes will check for L1 confirmation of the batch posted by sequencer to L1 inbox. If the order changed, node will re-org to the L1 result.
On the other hand validators just use L1 confirmed batches posted there. So they don't care about sequencer feed. Validator will pick up ordered txs there, execute them, create RBlock and send them to L1.","","üî• (1)"

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Double-check your API keys: Make sure that you have copied the API keys correctly from the explorer, and that there are no typos or errors in the keys.

2. Check your hardhat config file: Make sure that you have correctly configured your hardhat config file to use the API keys. Check that you have set the correct network ID, URL, and API keys in the config file.

3. Check your contract code: Make sure that your contract code is correct and matches the code that you deployed on Arb Nova. If there are any discrepancies between the deployed code and the code that you are trying to verify, the verification process will fail.

1. Use smaller data types: Use smaller data types like uint8 or bytes32 instead of uint256 or bytes to store data.

2. Remove unnecessary code: Remove any unused or unnecessary code from your contract. This can significantly reduce the bytecode size.

3. Use libraries: Use external libraries instead of writing all the code in your contract. This can reduce the size of the bytecode and also make the contract more modular.

4. Use modifiers: Use modifiers instead of writing the same code in multiple functions. This can reduce the overall size of the contract.

5. Use inline assembly: Use inline assembly code to optimize certain functions and reduce their bytecode size.

6. Minimize function parameters: Try to minimize the number of function parameters as each parameter adds to the bytecode size.","",""

All transactions are subject to the challenge window in the sense that all transactions pass the fraud proof period of 7-days.

Fraud proofs are explained here => https://developer.arbitrum.io/inside-arbitrum-nitro/#resolving-disputes-using-interactive-fraud-proofs

But, L2-to-L1 messages (withdrawals and other messages that are passed from L2 to L1) are the only transactions that must wait for the full challenge period to be over to be fully executed.
Transactions that happen only in L2 do not have to wait 7 days to be executed. Actually, just a couple of seconds.
For completion, L1-to-L2 messages (deposits and other messages that are passed from L1 to L2) take around 15-20 minutes to be fully executed.","",""

We thought it might be due to the dramatic increase in base fee, but I can't find any metrics to support that theory. When I send with ethersjs default gas calculation options the trx will fail at the API level with `code UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT reason cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit`. I have not tried a manual gas limit, perhaps this will help, but when I used the code provided for calculating L1/L2/gasLimit and submit with that the trx just reverts with no error.

I was looking at makerdao's cross-chain messaging library and the way they authenticate L2->L1 messages is something like...

 inbox.bridge().activeOutbox().l2tol1sender() == authenticatedSender

this is also how the custom token gateway tutorial does it  and how the arbitrum greeter tutorial does it

but the way open zeppelin implements authentication is

bridge.activeOutbox().l2tol1sender() == authenticatedSender

its just a subtle difference, but from a security stand point, probably we should use the bridge as the source of truth instead of the inbox? 

maybe it makes sense that a custom token gateway has an immutable inbox and uses that as a source of truth since the contract also sends messages through that inbox, but authenticated messages come from the bridge anyways. Is it just not that important whether we use an immutable inbox to get the bridge or just use an immutable value for the bridge to begin with if i don't use the inbox for any other methods to begin with?","",""

Are there any ways to get all arbitrum classic block traces in a day or two?
Arbitrum classic node responds to trace block rpc from a few seconds up to a few minutes, I'have looked through the code and know the reason is using `C` lib in golang.
I changed the node source code, the node starts and the only thing it does is tracing the blocks, but even with that the speed is awful.
Below are the logs from 12 such `modified` instances of the arb-classic node:

Classic node speeds are highly dependent on disk speed and latency, and RAM and CPU available. There's a closed issue in that repo that discusses several potentials options, but in general:
- Use NVMe drives, without RAID
- Ensure your nodes are not running out of RAM, and the CPU is not being used 100%
- One thing that does help is if you are walking the chain forward. As an example, if block 400 is already loaded in cache, then block 401 will load quickly because there is only a small difference that needs to be loaded from database.

But can't the sequencer cause a denial of service by increasing the L2 base fee so auto redemption will fail, requiring 'manual redemption' which would repeat another 24 hour censorship period?

As far as I can tell from the ArbGasInfo precompile and the exponential pricing model minimumBaseFee * exp(alpha * (backlog-tolerance)), to cause an auto redemption failure when an L2 balance has 1 eth to pay for L2 gas fees on auto redemption, it would take a backlog of ~17 billion L2 gas. Here alpha is 1/(inertia*speedLimit) = 1/(102*7_000_000), and tolerance is more or less negligble is 70_000_000.

Is there a maximum gas per block? otherwise the sequencer could cause a ~17 billion L2 gas backlog when the L2 base fee is at its minimum, 0.1 gwei, which would cost 1.7 eth.

 I would love to share, but, the discord auto moderation rules don't allow sharing links. Imo  this is a detriment to fostering a good developer community.

For instance, given the following wallet *0x4ee6612e889490b2b5d7b585b4d6a92c3991400f*.

If we compare the balance of this wallet using the `eth_getBalance` RPC method on block 44,085,008 and 44,085,009. We can see that this wallet received **0.000251448947459584 ETH**.
Looking on Arbiscan, we can see that this deposit was made from the transaction *0x013989c575e0ed34584a407c7ca62db3cf7147d9baab69bca29b438702da26e2* and if we look at input data, we see a deposit amount of **0.000260369347459584 ETH**. There is therefore a difference of **0.0000089204 ETH** which I believe correspond to the fees of this deposit (am I wrong?).

I first thought that this is just an internal transaction however if we look at internals, we see two transactions to the wallet but there are marked as **Invalid** and if we sum values we don‚Äôt get the correct amount.
I‚Äôve also tried to use the `Inbox.calculateRetryableSubmissionFee` method, as explained in the FAQ, but I don‚Äôt get a correct value neither.

So you will send your L2 transaction through L1, by calling one of the functions we have on delayed inbox (one way is, wait to use retryable creation, but there are other methods you can see on our delayed inbox contract)
after that you can wait and see if our sequencer will pick up your transaction. if not after then force inclusion period (currently 24h) you can force include it on L1. So you compoletely bypassed sequencer. Nodes and validators will pick up your force included transaction from L1","",""

So first of all, you're going to need a custom reverse gateway, like my colleagues mentioned you, as the one setup for the ARB token is exclusive for that token. You can use it as a reference for your own gateway though:
- L2 reverse gateway => https://arbiscan.io/address/0xCaD7828a19b363A2B44717AFB1786B5196974D8E
- L1 reverse gateway => https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbcE8aA77782F13D4202a230d978F361B011dB27

I think having a custom gateway will allow you to circumvent the need of conforming to the ReverseArbToken.sol (https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/ReverseArbToken.sol), but I can't guarantee it 100%. In case you need to conform to that interface, you can always have a wrapped version of your token that implements it.

You can then deploy the L1 version of your token (that should implement a bridgeMint and a bridgeBurn method, like IArbToken, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/main/contracts/tokenbridge/arbitrum/IArbToken.sol )  and register it through the router and gateway to have them linked.

We don't have implementations for this other than the ARB token, so we lack some experience in reverse bridging, but we are happy to assist you in case you run into any issues while implementing it.

Finally, we would like to know your use case for having a reverse bridging process, so if you can DM me or any of my colleagues with information about what problem you're trying to solve with it, or what scenarios you're looking to develop, we'd very thankful üí™","",""

My current ERC20 token has a lot of extra functionality and talks with a few of my dApp's contracts.

I'm still learning all these strange things happening with packages for forked repositories, so I definitely might be doing something wrong, but it seems like you can't `go get` the go-ethereum submodule from the nitro repository, but it seems like it just references the other repository anyway (github.com/offchainlabs/go-ethereum), so I doubt it would change anything for those errors even if it worked.","",""

"755423697027727471","msv_mahsa#6693","26/07/2023 12:15 am","A significant portion of transaction costs in Arbitrum is attributed to the L1 gas cost, which is essentially the expense of putting your transaction's calldata on the Ethereum network. To reduce gas costs, one approach is to employ data compression methods. This involves compressing data when storing large amounts on-chain, thereby lowering storage expenses. Additionally, it is advisable to develop smart contracts and applications with gas efficiency in mind. This can be achieved by minimizing unnecessary computations, loops, and storage operations to reduce overall gas consumption. 
Also, when building on Arbitrum, one of the main challenges is working around the fraud proof delay, especially when interacting between the L2 chain (Arbitrum) and the L1 chain (Ethereum). Transactions are asynchronous and will only take effect once the rollup block has been confirmed. Apart from this delay and the need for interoperability with Ethereum, most aspects of development within Arbitrum are similar to Ethereum, except for a small set of operations that function differently, as documented in: https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

Yes zkEVM requires running a node for proving, and to be competitive specialize infrastructure, but anyone can run this.

EVM compatibility as I said is 100% for zkEVM so that's no longer an issue. I don't think visibility is an issue for zkEVM.

Finality is less time for zkEVM if it's operating at scale. In other words batches are processed as soon as it becomes profitable to do so which requires enough trxs on the L2 to cover the gas and incentive fees.

Is trustless liveness not something they solved as well?

That's not accurate. Take `CREATE2` as an example, which in zk systems often produces addresses that differ from EVM compatible chains like Arbitrum One. The economics of opcodes aren't equivalent either, in that the true cost (not subsidized) to execute and prove different opcodes have different relationships than in the EVM. According to the EVM, an `ADD` is 3 gas and Keccak is 30 (plus 6 gas a word). But the true cost Keccak in a zk system is far greater than 10x an `ADD`.

2) How are these bisections done in parallel in the new model ? The given example in the paper clearly highlights how a 1v1 challenge would proceed, but I'm unsure how the same is applicable if there are let's say 100s (hypothetical) of rival level 0 edges competing against each other. These somehow happen to run in parallel now right ? Which didn't happen before.
3) How does Layer 1 (ethereum) resolve the final op-code level conflict ? (single step proof part) - This seems like the main coupling between L1 and L2 security right ? Any details on this would be awesome
4) The section 3.10.1 mentions a possible extension where the honest parties are _reimbursed_ the transaction fee. Made me curious, is there no reward/bonus what so ever apart from the refund of the gas fee for them ? Is this the same in current implementation ?

I'll try to answer your questions:
1) The problem with the current fraud proof system is that it allows for a special kind of attack: the delay attack. This kind of attacks prevents the chain state to be confirmed on L1 for a certain period of time (longer than the standard 7 day challenge period), which can be extended based on the amount of stake that can be spent for that. Bold prevents these delay attacks by allowing challenges to run in parallel instead of 1 vs 1.
2) Maybe the implementation example in 5.2.3 and 5.3 can help understanding this. Basically, for each edge a goroutine that uses a FSM to go through all states until confirmation. All validators can go through this process with every active edge.
3) There's a smart contract on L1 that actually executes the WASM instruction, giving out the correct result of that step, so that only the honest party will be able to win that challenge.
4) There's no extra reward/bonus in the current fraud proof system, nor will it be available in Bold out of the box. The Dao can, however, decide to develope this reward/bonus feature (of course, it would need to be designed and implemented). Bold paper proposes one way of doing it.

1) Yeah, I'm familiar with the delay attack and how it can be executed in current Arbitrum challenge protocol if it were open to public instead of a whitelist. That's the part I'm trying to understand, why was current system not able to run these challenges in parallel and had to do it 1 by 1 while the newer BoLD can ?  Like ... what core principals enabled it ?
2) That explains node architecture, and how it can keep track of multiple edges in parallel and bisect/confirm them as needed. So If I understand it correctly, the challenges on-chain still run 1 v 1 independently, but now because of this node structure, a single participant is able to take part in multiple challenges simultaneously. Is that correct ? ( I think an example of a challenge with more than 2 level 0 edges would help me understand better about how these are resolved in one go).
3) Great, I was able to find the contract and check this out, it's so cool that all the WASM instructions were implemented as functions in that way there enabling their execution on L1. 
4) oh, gotcha.

Mhm that really helped, I have the followup query on 1,2 which I've mentioned above, thanks again!","",""

Let's see if this helps:
The current protocol uses a sort of tournament structure built out of one-vs-one contests, so that multiple round of the tournament are needed to resolve everything. BOLD has a new way of structuring and managing the individual contests, so that even if there are multiple sub-challenges going on at the same time, they are logically independent of each other so it is easy for an honest party to conduct them in parallel. Also, in BOLD, if you're an honest party it is enough for you to watch a sub-challenge, and if someone else is making moves to defend the honest outcome in that sub-challenge, you don't need to do anything yourself (just keep watching in case they stop). In the current protocol you would have to stake on everything yourself and participate in a challenge against every individual who disagrees with you.","",""

Let me try to answer your questions:
1. `block.number` gives an estimate of the L1 block number at which the Sequencer received the transaction
2. `blockchash` returns a cryptographically insecure, pseudo-random hash for x within the range block.number - 256 <= x < block.number. If x is outside of this range, blockhash(x) will return 0. This includes blockhash(block.number), which always returns 0 just like on Ethereum.
3. `block.timestamp` will return the Sequencer's timestamp at which it received the transaction

From trying to read the code, it looks like `timestamp` can be anything the sequencer wants as long as it satifies the same restrictions that are imposed on L1 timestamps:
- new block timestamp >= prev block's timestamp
- it's not too far from the real timestamp
However, that doesn't explain why there are many duplicate timestamps for blocks. All I can find is `block.timestamp is similar in behavior to L1, but two different blocks in L2 can have the same block.timestamp, unlike in L1`, but it doesn't explain why this is the case

If the blob submission trx fails, all the signatures batched would revert as well.

The sequencer would need to be slashed for providing an improper signature of the block but that seems pretty straightforward to handle and can be done optimistically as well.

The sequencer would include a reference block in each signature to prove finality. So the hash signed could be the merkle root of the reference block and current block.

So on one side if a trx is processed through the sequencer ordering a block, you get this additional ability to attest that the trx did indeed take place and can provide the signature proof to any OP chain for example. Seems like a pretty big feature add that steals the thunder of one of the core value adds of Cosmos.

If you can provide a specific attack vector, that would be helpful.","",""

"394221849531121674","nat712","07/09/2023 3:40 am","Gotcha. I think we're speaking the same language.

Basically I'm saying to sign the batch and provide a reference to a previous signed batch as well that's say 20 blocks out for finality purposes. 

That way someone could take the future batch and validate a trx in the batch you want to prove in.

The signature coming from the sequencer provides 2 things, 1 is that it's a semi trusted actor and 2 it already has the ability to have fraud proofs submitted against it.

You could open this up to anyone I suppose that's willing to lock up a bunch of ETH on the L1 and just provide signatures that could be contested, but then you'd have to pay that additional actor.

If the sequencer is yeilding 30%+ right now, I think there's a lot of room to pay for this additional calldata and you get trust minimized bridging that no other bridge operator can rival.

Take stargate for example. Someone oracle passes a block header that may or may not have occured, no one knows, we just trust the oracle. Then the relayer provides the data necessary for the patricia proof. We trust that these actors don't collude or censor.

With the approach I've suggested you get the same security guarantees as the optimistic process itself. And with the signature you can do the patricia proof on another protocol and cutout the need for trusted actors since the sequencer already has a financial interest in not submitting fraudulent information.","",""

1) Arbitrum blocks are variable speed depending on throughput so relying on block number isn't recommended for finality. If you want a strong guarantee that your transaction is final that doesn't depend on trusting the sequencer, you can query `eth_getBlockByNumber(""finalized"")` in order to get the latest arbitrum block number that is finalized on ethereum. This happens when a batch is posted to ethereum and then the batch tx gets finality there. This is ex. what exchanges do accepting deposits do and other high security systems where offchain actions are happening based on receiving the payment
2) The more common answer here for a lot of use cases, the Arbitrum sequencer prevents reorgs from occuring on the chain if you trust the sequencer. Reorgs are still possible if bugs occur or the sequencer is dishonest, but don't occur in practice, many people just trust transactions immediately after seeing them as long as they're ok with those risks","",""

What happens is once the sequencer's batch is finalized on L1, all nodes can deterministically figure out the corresponding L2 block.
