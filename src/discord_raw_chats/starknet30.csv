**Why Empiric?**
Empiric is the first live oracle on StarkNet, and the leading provider of robust data feeds to the ecosystem today. The network is powered by data partners that include Alameda Research, Jane Street, Gemini, and CMT, and will be offering VRF and new data verticals soon. By leveraging StarkNet‘s on-chain computation Empiric is also pioneering computational data feeds and will enable the next generation of DeFi protocols to go beyond what is possible today.

The StarkNet ecosystem has opened the door to the next wave of innovation in DeFi, by providing an infrastructure for cheap, verifiable computation on-chain. 
Empiric Network, the native oracle on StarkNet, leverages these new capabilities and has been developing new feeds that integrate market data with essential computation needed for the DeFi ecosystem to mature. We call these new feeds computational feeds.

In collaboration with @curve_zero and using our high-quality first-party market data, we have developed a feed that computes a crypto-native USD yield curve on-chain, and delivers it into CurveZero’s smart contract for more efficient pricing.
