- K Framework is a framework for formal verification (and can be used to design languages easy to formally verify). Cairo, on the other hand, is not designed to address the formal verification problem, but to design provable statements (assuming the Cairo program really describe the wanted statement). Formal verification can be used to ensure a program describes some specific statement, but we don;t provide such a tool.
- Circom circuits is a framework to describe statements, which are compiled to zkSNARK circuits. Using ""simple"" circuits is very similar to using ASICs, it soves a specific problem very well, but you need a different circuit (and thus a different verifier/prover) if you changed the proven statement. Cairo, on the other hand, is uses a CPU like architecture (a universal circuit). Writing in Cairo is like writtingin the assembly language of a CPU, you can describe as many program as you want, and execute them all on the same CPU. Similarly, a single Cairo Prover/Verifier can be used for all Cairo programs.","",""

As is known, the STARK proof is much larger than a SNARK proof‚Äîit may be something as large as 100KB? If people want to verify this proof on e.g. Ethereum, do they need to send the proof to the verifier as a transaction? If so, would the data block be too large for Ethereum?

"608408606986993827","sg7389","29/12/2020 7:38 am","I guess the upcoming ""Proving Service"" would be the person in charge of sending tx with the STARK proof payload (ofc if a Cairo tx includes recursive STARK for anonymous tx, the end user as well has to prove in her device tho)

The size of STARK proof would be AFAIK around 20KB~100KB depending on the complexity of circuit (hash invocations count), but the order is log scale.

I'm optimistic for calldata usage because the eth2 phase1 can have data shards and it would be a game changer.","","üëç (1)"

So a prover service may take several programs and send only one proof attesting to the validity of all of the programs.

An alternative is to store on your dApp contract only the hash of your database, and keep the database offchain.

Another reason is that we now tend to believe that the ""right"" way one should write a Cairo program is slightly different than what we did there - hints should mainly be used for library functions, and possibly parsing the inputs in `main()` but not throughout the code (this makes it easier to avoid soundness mistakes).","","üëç (2)"

One (bad) example could be a program calculating the maximal number in some vector. Of course, if you do all the comparison only in the hints, changing their direction would result in the Cairo program being convinced the minimal number is actually the maximal (soundness issue).

Can different proofs from different programs be compressed into a single proof for submission to the verifier?

E.g I can see from https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/issues/2 that soon there will be a prover that can accept a trace that a developer produces for their program. Looking at https://etherscan.io/tx/0x654361d7e484e9cfef40e5925ac90d364def32df4fadb2b0d35abf964a9c8ea4 it seems like the proof being submitted there is large. Is it true that the proof in that transaction could contain the different programs e.g. for 2 or more completely unrelated systems, and they can share the cost by paying the person who submits the transaction?

E.g. How I see it: From the examples with the 15-puzzle. Two players could generate a trace, then a proof each of their solution which then goes to an agent who combines them and submits a single proof. Furthermore, players of a 24-puzzle and a 35-puzzle could also join in and bring the cost down within a single aggregate proof. Each new proof being added doesn't add much to the size of the final proof. Then the verfier contract logs the output of the proofs in a fact registry which then each separate dapp can look at for game logic.

Is that about right?","",""

Where to start depends on what you're looking for:
If you're looking for the core STARK verification, you should start with https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/master/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/cpu/CpuVerifier.sol.ref which is the implementation of Cairo verifier in START, or even https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/master/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/StarkVerifier.sol.ref (used by the previous file) which is a generic STARK verifier (not Cairo specific).
If you really want the math parts you have https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/master/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/FriLayer.sol implementing the FRI protocol inside STARK and https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/master/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/cpu/layout0/CpuConstraintPoly.sol, which implements the Cairo AIR constraints.
If you're looking for more Cairo things then you have the GPS contract https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/master/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/gps/GpsStatementVerifier.sol responsible for handling multiple programs in one proof, for example.

It seems that L1 gas costs for end-users of Arbitrum and StarkNet are currently within an order of magnitude of each other.

For example, Arbitrum reports that a Uniswap v2 swap on the Arbitrum Community Chain uses about 2k L1 gas today vs. I've seen data points from StarkWare ranging from 400 gas to 2k gas per tx.

I think I understand that the size of StarkWare's aggregated proofs is logarithmic in the size of the transaction batch being secured. How do we expect this scaling to manifest in terms of end-user costs? Is the idea that in five years when the gas price is 50x higher, each StarkNet L2 transaction will use single-digit amounts of L1 gas?","",""

1) It is hard for me to say what is the best decentralization strategy for batch construction but I can give couple of ideas - 
a) The sequencer can first commit to a batch of transactions, and sequence them based on some randomness source (e.g. VeeDo). The proof enforce that the sequence was done correctly and that all transactions in the committed batch were included.
b) Transactions can be submitted with time-locks, and the proof can prove the ""reveal"" of the transactions.

1) In the set of assertions in SOL, there are two  `require` https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/211d82720513e55db5eeb971363d647f337a3ae2/src/demo/amm_demo/amm_contract.sol#L59-L60 that assert the transition by comparing token numbers. Is it needed to assert it? My understanding is that the as the CAIRO calculates the new state https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/211d82720513e55db5eeb971363d647f337a3ae2/src/demo/amm_demo/amm.cairo#L43-L57 we could just assert the hash of the state? The values are verified by on the chain verifier anyway as they are part of the program output, and therefore the fact hash. I'm saying it from the correctness perspective, not any kind of optimization.
2) As previous state of tokens is provided as a hint, it's vital to store it in the output to get it properly asserted? Otherwise, a malicious prover could inject any value in the hint?
3) I think it's somewhat similar to what Tomasz Stanczak already asked but, the thing that is not deterministic and not asserted is a set of transactions that is passed to the program. A malicious trader could inject their transactions and receive a fully valid proof of the execution.

As far as I understand, it's based on  `VDF` where `f^(-1)` is fast to compute and can be used for COMMIT and `f` is slow to compute and can be used for time-locked REVEAL. 
The first step is the sequencer submitting a list of transactions in L1 to its smart contract. Actually `hash(list)` is used to minimize the overhead. The next step is the operator revealing the transactions (performs slow `f`) and provides the proof of execution to the verifier smart contract. 

1) Does the operator perform both REVEAL and execution of the transactions on the state in one program?
2) Is it the `hash(list)` that is included in the Cairo output of the operator program to match the fact later on with the initial one provided by the sequencer? Do I get it right?
3) Is the sequencer and the operator can be treated as the parts of ""backend"", similar to AMM example?

Otherwise, a malicious sequencer could REVEAL all transactions, analyze them and add their own.

Cairo lets you - today - scale apps on L2. One powerful example was that is the new dYdX app, which is powered by Cairo. It is not merely a scaled up version of their previous L1 system. Thanks to Cairo, they could build features like cross-margins, instant trading, higher leverage, etc. A few days after going live, a couple of weeks ago, there was a sharp price drop, and dYdX had to liquidate many positions. Thanks to Cairo, their system has high frequency price feeds, and the entire event ran swimmingly. On L1 processing this number of liquidations would have required 10% of Ethereum's gas budget during that rush hour. More in this here:

re your 2nd question - even if verifying proofs is possible on various blockchains, there should be a careful design to allow the L2 state to be synchronized. The definition of L2 (as I understand it) is that the L1 defines its state. In the example of StarkNet, the state of the system is defined by the StarkNet L1 contract.

"743395542196944977","perama","15/05/2021 3:16 pm","I just had an idea relating to large trades on automatic market makers and the slippage they incur.

In one talk @EliBenSasson#9612 describes how the transaction ordering inside an L2 block can be determined by the output of a VDF/veedoo.

With publicly visible transactions, a single large trade could normally be abused by slotting transactions before and after the trade as MEV. With random ordering, these attacks would not be as easy to achieve, although an attacker could submit many small transactions with the hope of a probabilistic win

However, because transactions are cheap, the original large trade could instead be fragmented into ten smaller trades 

The ""attacker"" now sees those ten transactions and has the opportunity to send multiple smaller counter-trades that will be randomly interleaved in between. 

In this way, the AMM price fluctuates up and down multiple times per block, resulting in less slippage for the original seller. At the end of the block, if enough arbitrage transactions were sent, the AMM price may even be similar to before hand.

What do you think about the idea? Intra-block trade fragmentation as a way of attracting arbitrage for mutual benefit","",""

This message can be signed and sent to the Prover, who will incorporate that change into a proof. That proof then ensures that the L1 accounts for those entities have the new account balances.

The StarkEx system has existing in-production apps. So the proof cost is shared between many. 

The decision of which messages are sent for proving could be decided based on your application message frequency.

The difference with respect to lightning is that you don't need 1-1 channels. This removes the need for channel balancing activities and allows for more flexible payments if different recipients are added later.

Check out the StarkEx docs:

"743395542196944977","perama","22/06/2021 8:24 am","I think you can also set something up where you can pay to someone who has never used Ethereum. They generate an Ethereum address, pass it to you as a message (e.g. server to server in your instance) . You sign the message, it goes in the proof. Now they can send some back to you on L2 by sending a message. 
Later, they can exit the L2 and have the funds on L1. 

(Compared to lightning where an L1 transaction is required to open a channel).","","üëç (1)"

1. The compiler first applies the offset of `-1` to `ap`, then finds the value (`[]`) at that location
2. The operation is performed with the operand derived from step 1, the operator `+` and the ""second"" operand, `1000`.

"823926145950548069","greg_vardy","22/06/2021 6:44 pm","Yeah so in vm.py, run_instruction(..) we call compute_operands(..) with the instruction (for example ```[ap] = 12345 + [ap -1]```). Then inside compute_operands(..), we compute the address of the operands with compute_op0_addr(..) and compute_op1_addr(...).  But only compute_op1_addr explicitly checks if op1 is an immediate:
```
        elif instruction.op1_addr is Instruction.Op1Addr.IMM:
            assert instruction.off2 == 1, 'In immediate mode, off2 should be 1.'
            base_addr = self.pc
```
while compute_op0_addr(..) does not have this check, but it will still work as I'll explain:
```
    def compute_op0_addr(self, instruction: Instruction):
        base_addr: MaybeRelocatable
        if instruction.op0_register is Register.AP:
            base_addr = self.ap
        elif instruction.op0_register is Register.FP:
            base_addr = self.fp
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError('Invalid op0_register value')
        return (base_addr + instruction.off1) % self.prime

class Register(Enum):

But op1 is type Op1_addr which is :

    class Op1Addr(Enum):

        IMM = 0 
        # op1 = [ap + off2].

        FP = auto()
        # op1 = [op0].
        OP0 = auto()
```
Because of these differences,  this instruction ```[ap] = 12345 + [ap -1]; ap++```  actually results in 12345 being op1 and [ap - 1] being op0 , as you can see from adding logging to vm.py: compute_operands(..):","","üëç (1)"

So to map this to my understanding of Cairo proof generation: This appears to have direct application to the time required in proof generation

The prover performs low degree testing (FRI) to generate a probabalistic proof (that the polynomials in the AIRs have low degree). The proof is expensive because it requires evaluation of multiple points. The paper outlines a method to map this computation to allow speed similar to FFT-enabled calculations. Without this new mapping, the computation cannot enjoy FFT-speeds because the prime used in Cairo is not a composite of two smaller primes.

(Moreover, that the technique will have many applications outside of Cairo)

You‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs about proving time. By utilizing the move to the frequency domain, you can do a lot of polynomial operations faster. This is useful in starks, Groth16 and many other pricing systems

The current methods people use require that the prime has high 2-adicity - p-1 has a large power of 2 as a factor (tbh doesn‚Äôt have to be 2, just many small factors)

I imagine that there needs to be a statement like: a block producer should have CPU/GPU/RAM specs W. Then a statement blocks should be checkpointed at cadence X. Then sent to mainnet at cadence Y. Then testing with computer W allows you to determine roughly Z the number of proofs possible in period X.

Then a transaction can be partly priced based on components that contribute to A time to process, and B time time to prove. E.g. an ECDSA operation built-in time C and a Pedersen hash time D.  Those costs C and D can be estimated by filling a block with only that operation and dividing the number of the single operations performed achieved within cadence X.

And partly the cost is pinned to the mainnet gas price and period Y. Which is based on the size of CALLDATA it generates with a Storage operation, which is ?polylogarithmic, but practically can be seen as linear at scale.

I'm not sure I understand fully the terminology you're using. I assume that by CALLDATA you mean the L1 on-chain data footprint, and by state growth you mean the size of the L2 state.
so to try and answer your questions - 
1. Yes, since the contract code is part of the state. A non formal description of the state is just a mapping between `address` to `(contract_code, storage)`
2. Transaction are not part of the CALLDATA, but only state changes, so I think the answer to your question is right. I'm not surre I understand what you mean by ""cause the minimum CALLDATA use possible in StarkNet"".
3. Yes, messages to and from L1 are sent as CALLDATA.

```

This piece of code fails to compile with the following error:

Error: code:39:5: Cannot convert the implicit arguments of bar to the implicit arguments of foo.

Why can't implicit arguments be converted? Why is there even a need to convert implicit arguments of `bar` to implicit arguments of `foo`? It's `foo` that calls `bar`.

Then, you can't use existing compilers without writing a new backend for the instruction set. Writing such a backend can be done but it won't allow you to write extremely efficient code when needed. Other disadvantage has to do with it StarkNet: most programming languages don't natively support the concept of a contract (defining storage variables, external functions and so on).
Now, assuming you decided to write your own compiler because of the above, you can choose the syntax for the language. I agree that choosing a syntax very close to existing programming languages is preferred. Cairo was inspired by python (minus the indention-matters aspect) + the pointer notation from c. Rust is another good option, and eventually it's becomes a question of taste.
I do hope to see more and more languages that compile to the Cairo instruction set in the future (solidity is getting there soon with the warp project).","","üôå (2)"

What do you mean by ""real execution bandwidth""?
Eventually, like has been seen for most public network, as usage ticks up, the cost for execution will tick up. So even if in the beginning it is cost efficient to run your transpiled code; eventually, costs will creep up, and systems that were built from the ground up in Cairo will be 30x more efficient than yours.
I'll add that these Cairo native programs may be 30x cheaper... Or 30x more powerful. They may implement functionnalities you can't dream of in the EVM because it's too expensive","","üëå (2)"

My understanding is that the system would require two changes:

- Some aspect of the proving system is modified to gain full zero-knowledge privacy. At present, a proof leaks some information that prevents full privacy of a program lifecycle. To extract that information would be difficult, but theoretically possible, with the current proving system. This aspect is not currently implemented because the focus is scaling not privacy.
- You have a proving node locally (rather than using a network Operator), and you generate a proof that is then passed to the network for aggregation.

A Cairo program is eventually translated to constraints on the execution trace. Builtins are a way to have custom-made constraints implementing specific functions that interact with your native Cairo code. Consider the hash builtin for example, from the perspective of a Cairo developer, he's just placing x,y in the memory segment pointed to by hash_ptr, and to him this is equivalent to calling hash(x,y). Behind the scenes what you get are some special contraints on memory cells around x,y that make sure that some other third cell z is in fact the result of hash(x,y). The same goes for range checks, rather than calling a function which checks that a<=b (whicj is hard in finite fields), you simply place the values of a,b in a designated memory segment on which specific range check constraints will be applied. To be able to use this trick more than once in the same program you're going to need to keep the builtin points updated, otherwise you're overriding cells.","","ü§Ø (1),üíØ (2)"

An analogy might be to imaging the trace as excel spreadsheet:

The program is broken down into small steps, and each step goes into the spreadsheet in a new row.
The proof is constructed by performing checks on these rows (not necessarily starting at the top and working to the bottom). 

Sometimes a new row has something that is a bit different (such as calculating a hash). 

The way that the row-checks are performed, it makes more sense to put all the hashes in a dedicated hash-only column. Then, they can be handled in a special way, separate from the other columns in the trace. Each builtin might have its own column. 

So when you call a function that does a hash operation you say 'I am going to need the hash column' and you pass the pointer in the curly brackets. The program then knows to use the appropriate special column in constructing the trace. If you say you are going to pass the value - but don't, or if you have an IF-ELSE section where you could end up either passing or not-passing the builtin, then the compiler lets you know

Now I see that it forms the basis for the `is_nn` check. 

So looking at that, I am thinking that: Because field elements are taken modulo P, how do you know if something is negative or positive? You take the modulo. But in the range [-P, P] you can take the modulo and find a positive value in the range. That is, -1 has a valid positive field element equivalent after the modulo. So is -1 one negative or not? I think yes: with the reason that the field range redefined as [-P/2, P/2] gives some negative and some positive numbers. So not we can set a rule: it is negative if when you find the positive field equivalent in the range [0, P], and the value is in the range [P/2, P] 

Or that, when split into `high` and `low` parts, a field element is negative if high is greater than P/2, or ~RC_BOUND as defined in the math library.

I have a contract with
(1) a storage variable (mapping x,y => z);
(2) view function to retrieve the stored z given x & y;
(3) an internal compute-intensive function that contains ~800 `is_not_zero` operations stored to local variables & ~200 of sum-of-product operations;
(4) an external function that takes input values, calls the compute-intensive function (3) to do work, do some more work and returns the results.

Now, a test that carries out 1 invoke of the external function (4) takes ~97 seconds to complete, while a test that carries out 1 invoke of the external function (4) followed by 9 calls to the view function (2) takes ~648 seconds to complete. Intuitively I would estimate the second test to take only a little more than 97 seconds to complete based on the assumption that the calls are cheap compute-wise and thus time-wise. Yet (648-97)/9 ~ 61 seconds, meaning each call function roughly takes a whopping 61 seconds to complete. What am I missing? Does this mean in order to keep the ""cheap"" functions in a contract fast (in proving time), it is better to move the compute-intensive functions to a separate contract? <= I haven't experimented with this yet.","",""

See the finalization code in https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-examples/blob/master/keccak/keccak.cairo, which uses the keccak_ptr array and creates sets of 3-instance chunks.
My suggestion is not to rewrite this part, but simply use it - so that whenever you want to compute the keccak permutation you register in the keccak_ptr array (you'll need a hint to compute the result, as done in the original keccak function) and at the end the programmer calls finalize which actually does the keccak verification.","",""

I know I can always use `y = bool_condition * y_value_1 + (1-bool_condition) * y_value_2` where the two bools are mutually exclusive, but then both of the y values will get computed. If using if-else I assume one of the two can be skipped leading to better performance.","","üíØ (1)"

so far, so good.

Now, I'm trying to identify where in the language the nondeterminism ""leaks out"" but couldn't yet put my finger on it (This could be partially because I'm working on StarkNet which is stateful, and therefore has a different flavor)

At the beginning I thought the lack of try/catch was a good example, but then I noticed that if Cairo is turing complete, nothing really should prevent me from doing A if a signature is valid or doing B otherwise. Currently this is not possible because the building blocks (Cairo + builtins) work as asserts, e.g. `verify_ecdsa_signature`, which will only fail. I get the circuit analogy and that you either ""pass the circuit"" or not. And I know the answer goes in the line with the idea that this programs have to be *proved*, not executed. Nevertheless, I'm having a hard time trying to convey this idea to people.","",""

"866704318060560404","FeedTheFed | StarkWare#8826","26/10/2021 12:37 am","My suggestion: forget about circuits. Have a Von Neumann architecture in mind and think of Cairo as the language to express programs in this architecture. So far things are pretty normal, except that Cairo was designed with the purpose of being able to succinctly prove execution. It is easy to say what does it mean for a program to execute correctly when every memory cell is fixed (e.g. the statement jmp x if [y] = 10 should change pc to x only if the value of the memory in address y is 10). However, if I just give you the program code, and I say that the output is 7, what does this mean? With one initial memory assignment, the output might be 7, and it can be different in a different assignment. This is where nondeterminism appears in Cairo, if my program acts based on an unassigned value of the memory, it remains up to the prover what to put in that cell before he starts proving the correct execution. This concept does not arise when you're just running programs on your favorite Von Neumann architecture because the memory is deterministic, you're not proving anything but merely acting based on the current values.

As for your example, the ECDSA builtin knows how to do the following: take three values in memory r,s,m, and verify that (r,s) is a valid signature for m. You could also implement ""(r,s) is not a valid signature for m"", which simply runs the same algorithm but asserts inequality in the end. Technically you could have the builtin return 0/1.","","üíØ (4)"

I think I've asked this before but being relatively new to zkSNARKs I'm still trying to get my head around AIRS. 
If I were to do a ""proof of physics"" using zkSNARKs and something like Circom...  I'd break the problem down into quadratics, generate a circuit (etc) for a certain number X cycles and from that a user (eg in a browser) could then generate and submit a proof to the smart contract. Example here might be the public inputs are a starting position and the user submits a proof they know the final position after X cycles.

Is Cairo/Airs analogous to this? Is that what the tweet is trying to show? And indeed a client (e.g. a browser) generate complex proofs at runtime and submit them to a smart contract?

Builtins are predefined optimized low-level execution units which are added to the Cairo CPU board to perform predefined computations which are expensive to perform in vanilla Cairo (e.g., range-checks, Pedersen hash, ECDSA, ‚Ä¶).

The communication between the CPU and the builtins is done through memory: each builtin is assigned a continuous area in the memory and applies some constraints (depending on the builtin definition) on the memory cells in that area...

Cairo code may read/write from those memory cells to ‚Äúinvoke‚Äù the builtin. The following code verifies that hash(x, y) == z:

It is not trivial to express ""cell x is in the range [0,M]"" with polynomial equalities. Common and heavier operations such as range checks are not actually written in native Cairo, but with tailored constraints (analogous to pre-compiles).  The way that it's implemented is roughly by having a dedicated memory segment where the range check constraints are applied, hence from the developer's perspective, to apply range checks he just needs to place the value at a specific place in memory.","","üëç (1)"

Now, account addresses are not accounts. An account has an address, a balance, and an authentication mechanism. What you're referring to is only a private/public key pair, a building block of accounts. The fact that the lastest StarkNet release supports sending signatures in a privileged way (instead of calldata as it used to be) is not enough to make an Account model in the system.

Put differently: just by deriving a public key from a private key, doesn't get you an address onchain, nor a balance, etc (note than in Ethereum, the public key is not your address either, but a hash of the public key). You still need an authentication mechanism, which is not implemented at the StarkNet level but at the smart contract level. Enter then the Account contract:

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Account.cairo

One bad way of achieving this is ""just sending"" the value, and have the verifier examine it himself (it would increase the proof size by transmitting intermediate values you don't really care about). I'm writing ""just sending"" because it's more complicated than it looks. The verifier sees a proof that the prover holds a valid execution trace of a program P. Among other things, he sees a commitment to that trace. If, as part of the computation, I apply a range check to cell (i,j), then what good would it do the verifier if I send him some value which is < BOUND, the naive approach would require me to open the commitment at this location. Luckily, we don't really have to transmit/reveal those values, we can apply some tricks and add a few constraints that would ensure this. You can read about the actual constraints in 9.7 here https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1063.pdf (this section talks about how to prove that certain cells contain some given data, but the constraints involved are very simillar to what's required for range checks, see 9.9).","",""

However, there is a conclict about which value to return, should it be the binded value from the x == 0 branch (which is [ap-1], since output_ptr is implicitly returned by serialize word) or the binding from the x == 1 case (the local variable). To solve this you need the bindings to agree across all branches, one common way to solve this:
```
    if x == 0:
        serialize_word(x + y) 
        tempvar output_ptr = output_ptr               
    else:
        tempvar output_ptr = output_ptr
    end
```
In the above, regardless of the value of x, output_ptr is bound to [ap-1] (tempvar is syntactic sugar for placing a value in ap and then defining a reference to it)

Also, since 0.5.2, you don't need ``local output_ptr : felt* = output_ptr``, as the compiler now handles rebindings due to function calls when you use the alloc_locals instruction.","",""

The naive way I would implement it:

1.  parse main.cairo and look for inheritance flag

3. parse any .cairo file being inherited and copy any block beginning with a decorator or func keyword and ending with end

But it records the input and output in the given `keccak_ptr` argument. Later `finalize_keccak` should be called to verify that output was indeed the keccak hash of the input. When used this way, they are sound. The reason it's written like this is to allow some parallelization - keccak is a bitwise function that works on 64-bit words. But Cairo works with 251-bit words, so we can compute keccak on 3 instances in parallel (like SIMD).

Currently the plan is to change the account model to address (among other things) this exact problem. We are working closely with the ERC-4337 team, but the idea is to separate the transaction handling into two parts - validation and execution, and to add nonce to the contract state. The problem you are describing will be solved since the transaction will fail at the validation step and won't ""burn"" the hash as it is doing today. Once the transaction will pass the validation step, the nonce will be consumed regardless if the execution has succeeded or not (which is quite similar to Ethereum in that sense).

We are at the final stage of finalising the proposal and we will post it once it's ready.","","üëç (6)"

A little bit of context: I have been running some examples on the playground and I realised that right after the memory addresses containing the compiled bytecode for the program, there will be a few (2 or 3) cells containing what I think are addresses to ""output"" locations or the first address that is empty. Thus, when the return in the main updates the program counter, it gets to read those positions. The questions are:
- How are these positions computed? Meaning, how does the runner know where it will store outputs /ending position before running the program. It looks a bit like the snake that bites its tail. Is this related to the nondeterministic computation model?
- What is the halting condition? If the ""final"" next_pc indeed points to unallocated positions, perhaps the halting condition is: execute until current allocation pointer <= next_pc ...

But making the memory continuous when you don't know the size of each segment is difficult.
Our solution is to allow the runner to use (segment number, segment_offset) pairs rather than the field elements for addresses.
Once the run is complete we know the sizes of the segments, we assign an absolution address (a field element) to each segment and replace every (segment number, segment_offset) pair with a field element to create a provable run.

For example: https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/blob/master/src/starkware/starknet/core/os/transactions.cairo#L345
`global_state_changes` is a dict of `StateEntry` structs, which in turn contain a pointer to another dict (it would have worked the same if instead of `StateEntry` you'd have a pointer directly).
It works as follows: you ""guess"" (using a hint) the value of the main dict, compute from it the new value of the pointer, and finally call `dict_update` which verifies the guess and performs the update.
Note that due to the use of a hint you won't be able to use it as-is in StarkNet contracts (but I believe that it can be fixed by using `dict_read`, `dict_write`  and a default dict).","",""

dict_write(key=0, value=17)

For this message, suppose the function should create a list of n felts in memory, populated (in the hint) with values of some function `complicated_function`.  Here it is in code:

```
func create_list(n : felt):
   alloc_locals
   local my_list_ptr = alloc()
   %{ hint_to_populate_my_list %}
end
```

By my understanding, `my_list_ptr` points to a new memory segment allocated by `alloc()`.  So from within the Python hint I should compute 

`my_list = complicated_function(n) : List[int]` 

and then (from within the hint) set the segment pointed to by `ids.my_list` to the list value `my_list`.  I can then exit the hint and verify the value which has nondeterministically appeared at `my_list_ptr`.

Unfortunately I can't figure out how to set a segment to a list value from within a Python hint.  I would be very grateful for guidance on the correct way to do this please.  Thanks in advance.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

I am trying to understand the ecdsa signature verification...and I am still puzzled how this function actually checks that the message and public key is actually verified here?
I see the hint being used, so is there something going on with that behind the scenes and if so where could I find add_signature for ecdsa_builtin? (i looked in builtin folder and found an add_signature function but it wasn't for ecdsa_builtin...unless I just missed it in my search)","",""

"283325240841338881","pajkecrypto","07/03/2022 6:59 pm","Hello everyone. I'm currently doing Ex2 of @Henri-l | StarkWare's ERC721 guide, and I'm a bit stuck. 

I have gotten the random values assigned:
```
legs: 1
sex: 2
wings: 3
```

My current code is:

```
Interface Contract:

  func get_animal_characteristics(token_id : Uint256) -> (sex : felt, legs : felt, wings : felt):

        let legs = ERC721_legsOf(token_id)
        let sex = ERC721_sexOf(token_id)
        let wings = ERC721_wingsOf(token_id)

        return (sex, legs, wings)
    end

ERC721_base.cairo Contract:

func mint_animal{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(to: felt) -> (tokenId: Uint256):
    
    let token_id : Uint256 = Uint256(2, 0)
    
    # Ensures the token_id is unique
    let (exists) = _exists(token_id)
    assert exists = 0

    let to = to
    let animal : Animal = Animal(legs=1, sex=2, wings=3)
    ERC721_animals.write(token_id, animal)
    ERC721_owners.write(token_id, to)

    Transfer.emit(_from=0, to=to, tokenId=token_id)
    return(token_id)
end
```

I've also got some getters set up, and a storage variable to store Animals.

I've also created a couple of view functions to get the values of a specific token ID to query traits here: https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x07351fc00da0e904a31233ef123e745f79868461760d5f0f2549bfd1199498fd#readContract

And indeed, when I call legsOf, sexOf, wingsOf with the specific tokenID, it returns the right values after minting.

I mint tokenID 2 to the Evaluator contract, and I submit my deployed contract as a solution to the Evaluator. When I then call `ex2b_test_declare_animal` my transaction gets rejected.

I've been hacking at the excersize for almost 24 hours, and I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong

Any help is appreciated!","",""

Hello everyone, I am on ex4 for the ERC721 tutorial by Henri. My current burn function is

```
func ERC721_declare_dead_animal(token_id):

    let exists = _exists(token_id)
    assert_not_zero(exists)
    
    let animal : Animal = Animal(legs=0,sex=0,wings=0)

    ERC721_burn(token_id)

    return()
end
```

Feels like this should work, but I'm stuck at the function that the evaluator calls beforehand. 

```
# Getting an animal id of Evaluator. tokenOfOwnerByIndex should return the list of NFTs owned by and address
    let (token_id) = IExerciceSolution.token_of_owner_by_index(contract_address = submited_exercise_address, account=evaluator_address, index=0)

For the life of me, I cannot figure out the implementation of token_owner_by_index()

I'm thinking we need a new storage variable:

```
@storage_var
func ERC721_balances(account: felt) -> (balance: Uint256):
end

But this would have me implementing that in all the different methods, which has me thinking that there must be a simpler solution and that I am overthinking this by a lot

Confused re `assert`. Would appreciate some clarification.

The docs (https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/cairo_intro.html#memory-model) suggest writing to memory and verifying its contents are synonymous.

Taking the program quoted here:
https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/builtins.html#the-builtins-directive

Removing the `assert` directive in line 12 seems to have no effect. If that is true, why is it used?

Generally, what are use-cases for `assert`, and respectively, when is an assignment appropriate?

From my best guess, it was due to the fact that the compiler cannot determine value during compiling time(issues to do with revoked reference, implicit arguments); 
Or I got it wrong, the reaason is none of the above?

The code is here:

func IsEven{bitwise_ptr : BitwiseBuiltin*}(num) -> (IsEven):
    let (IsEven) = bitwise_and(num, 0x00)
    return (IsEven)
end

#A practice to recursively product even elements inside the array. 
#Code is wrong currently, please check the bitwise part only.
func array_product{bitwise_ptr : BitwiseBuiltin*}(arr : felt*, size) -> (product):
    if size == 0:
        return (product=1)

        return (product=product_of_rest)

> In practice the exact location of the allocated memory will be determined only when the program terminates, which allows us to avoid specifying the size of the allocation

im only starting a very high level intro into cairo, but is it possible to call an equivalent of `calloc` or something similar that lets us preallocate an array if we know its size before hand?

im not familiar with the innerworkings of how contract execution is paid for yet, but i imagine it would be more efficient to preallocate the array to 3 which depending on the underlying implementation of the memory allocation would avoid at least 2 allocations if its smart, 3 if its very dumb

in practice with smart contracts this kind of thing can lead to fairly significant savings in computational units/gas/whatever","",""

I have a contract function that wants to return an array of structs, which seems to be currently possible. But the twist is that I want to have pointers inside the struct type and that is not supported yet.

The use case example is return a bunch of metadata regarding a group of tokens in an ERC721.

Will it be supported soon ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ?

```
struct TokenInfo:
    member tokenId: Uint256

A namespace is logically the identifier.  Just import the namespace -- you get all the identifiers within it.  A Python class import is conceptually similar (and this may be what the Cairo namespace behaviour is based on).

(It's not quite like a Python class though because the Cairo garbage-collector will eliminate any identifiers from a namespace that are not called from outside that namespace but from within the file in which the namespace appears ... but that can be worked around with a dummy call.)","",""

Reason:
1. The standard serialize_word method is not doing well on my side, no idea why.
2. According to 
https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/debugging_tricks.html#debugging-tricks
> In addition to these flags, you can always add a hint with a print statement to output the value of a certain identifier or a memory cell.

It seems that this is the suggested way currently, cause cairo doesn't have log utilities as of yet.
```
I already checked many existing cairo libs using hints, but I don't have a clue - maybe I'm just dumb. 

===

Considering a simple program, size=5:

```
func random(size):
    alloc_locals
    local result
    %{
        from os import urandom
        result = urandom(ids.size)
        print(ids.size)
        print(result)
    %}
    return ()
end

```
This works, with results printed correctly:

```
5
b'\xd6\x99\xdb}\xe1'
```
I guess that the *result* var being used here belongs to inside the scope of hint(python) var. Because even after removing *alloc_locals* and *local result*, the code still worked fine.","",""

The `let x = foo(y)` and `let (x) = foo(y)` syntax just automatically create references to the locations ( `[ap - 1]`, `[ap - 2]`, etc.) of the return values. 

It doesn't really make sense to use tempvar here because tempvar assigns a value to a new memory cell and then creates a reference to that cell. In this case the function has already assigned the return values to memory cells, so we just need an easy way to reference them.","","ü§ù (2)"

let a = 0

call_my_fn(a)

The way I'm doing it rn is by having ANOTHER function, like so:
```
func get_a(foo: felt) -> (a: res):

So instead of:
```
@storage_var
func my_var() -> (array_len : felt, array : felt*):
end

you can define two variables:
```
@storage_var
func my_var_array_len() -> (len : felt):

@storage_var
func my_var_array(i : felt) -> (res : felt):

```
let (local keccak_ptr_start) = alloc()
let keccak_ptr = keccak_ptr_start

# run as many keccaks as you want (or verify_eth_signature), pass keccak_ptr implicitly 
let (hash : Uint256) = keccak_uint256s_bigend{keccak_ptr=keccak_ptr}(n_elements=2, elements=elements)

# call finalize once at the end
finalize_keccak(keccak_ptr_start=keccak_ptr_start, keccak_ptr_end=keccak_ptr)
```
You can also call keccak, keccak_bigend and keccak_as_words exactly the same, but for these you have to prepare the input as 64-bits little endian words, or use the helper functions for that, for example:
```
let (inputs) = alloc()
let inputs_start = inputs

# add many words, uints, and felts to inputs, can use the helper functions
keccak_add_uint256s{inputs=inputs}(n_elements=n_elements, elements=elements, bigend=0)

# call keccak with inputs
keccak{keccak_ptr=keccak_ptr}(inputs=inputs_start, n_bytes=n_elements * 32)
```
To get the best optimization we can offer right now, you should call keccak as many times as you need in your code and call finalize_keccak once at the end.

So the thing is, every deployer have their own Starknet state, so we have to store all of the deployer in the same state, or else, they will end up in different states, which will lead to the error saying that specific contract is not deployed

for instance, lets say we have two contracts, `Account` and `ERC20`
the first way is to make 2 different fixtures functions to deploy them

```async def alice():```
```async def ust():```

but since they're deployed to two different states, we can't sign `ust` using `alice`, because in `alice` perspective, `ust` haven't been deployed

to fix this, we need to deploy them in the same state

```async def alice_and_ust()```

Cairo is a language for writing provable programs: running a Cairo program produces a trace that can then be sent to a trustless prover, which generates a STARK proof for the validity of the statement or computation represented by the Cairo program. The proof can then be verified using a verifier (which may or may not be on-chain).

I have some questions, maybe you can offer some insight!

The docs say that running a Cairo program generates a trace, which is kind of agnostic; we can feed this trace to a prover (implementation not specified), which can later be verified by a verifier. References to this prover/verifier pair seem to point to SHARP and StarkNet, and verification in L1. I was interested in a more general use of Cairo.

I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm misunderstanding the process. The example setup I have in my mind is kinda like this. Me and a friend agree upon a Cairo program in some way. I‚Äôll run this Cairo program on my machine with private inputs and generate the trace. Then, I‚Äôll feed this trace to my prover on my computer and generate a STARK proof. Then I‚Äôll send this proof to the friend, perhaps with a few extra data, I don‚Äôt know. Then the friend will run the verifier and know the outputs of this program without needing to trust me or knowing secret inputs.

Does this story make sense, or am I misunderstanding something?

If it does make sense, could someone point me to this prover/verifier implementations? Like a library or something that I can compile and run locally.

I think `cast(data_content_label, felt*)` only converted it into one felt, not array of felt (each character is one felt)

for example I can read a string ""<svg></svg>"" in my contract

```
let (data_content_label)=get_label_location(dw_content)

dw_content:
    dw '<svg></svg>'
```
In python I can use `list(map(lambda str: str_to_felt(

or is that something I have to specify in the function input parameter (calculate using python or js)? I guess in Cairo it is just unassigned integer so it doesn't know it represents the string `name` hence unable to calculate the length or array?

This is not a problem when you want to return a single struct (you can just return the struct content instead), but it's a problem if you want to return a struct containing an array within another struct or array. The only way to do it I can think of is to return a big array (arr_len, arr) which is in fact the concatenated [arr_len :: array_values] of all the arrays you want to send, and use their index in your structs, but this is a really complex way to do it.

We implemented a custom `ERC721Time` contract used in Lens Protocol Social Graph. 

Usual ERC721 contract stores only an owner of token. Mint timestamp is now stored in a TokenData struct alongside the owner address. It has 2 members: owner and mint_timestamp.

In order to port Lens contracts we rewrote the following functions: mint, transfer, burn. And created new get, set and view functions for TokenData struct. For example token_data_of, mint_timestamp_of, owner_of.

"507709077967601667","grillo.eth","04/08/2022 11:22 am","Hello everyone. I‚Äôm starting to look into building a game on StarkNet, where I would need 2+ users to take turns in calling a function. The input of one user would change depending on the input of the previous one. At some point, one of them would win the game. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs tic-tac-toe. The game is not real-time, but I‚Äôm looking for it to run as fast as possible from turn to turn.
I have some very basic questions about StarkNet, that someone might help me figure out:
1) The simplest design choice would seem to be to make every function call a state-changing transaction. Currently, on StarkNet Alpha, transactions take quite some time. I‚Äôm sure this will improve in the future, but I would like to know if there‚Äôs an estimate on how long a transaction might take to confirm in the future, and if this would be a viable path for a game like the one described above. A full match could easily take 500+ turns to complete.
2) A second design alternative could be to use a view function to receive signed user interactions and produce an output that would allow the next user to sign its next move, while saving all the steps off-chain. Once the game is finished, I could call a state-changing function that calls the view function recursively, once for every turn, until the winner is confirmed and stored. For this scenario: is there something like a ‚Äúgas limit‚Äù for StarkNet functions that I should take into account? Does this sound like a plausible solution?
3) I‚Äôve also read about SHARP, but if I understand correctly, SHARPs are independent from StarkNet, right? 
4) Is there any other more obvious design choice I could be missing?
Any info is welcome. Thank you!","",""

1) Create a match registry on-chain with an initial timestamp and calculate a max_finish timestamp X minutes from then.
2) Have players call a view function on each turn, including the previous state (positions of all players and so on), turn number, and their signed move as inputs. The view function has the game logic. If it doesn't find a winner, it returns a new state, which would allow the next player to call the view function again, until a winner is found.
3) Each player stores the whole chain of actions. When a player wins, he can submit the whole list of actions to an external function, which verifies each step and finishes the game if the user really won. The first player to submit a whole chain of turns that finds him as the winner before max_finish would win.
4) A fraudulent move would be avoided because the user would not be able to provide a chain of valid movements that lead to him being the winner: the resulting state of the previous turn would not match up with input of the next turn. And he wouldn't be able to create new signed moves from other players to create additional moves that make him the winner.
5) If a player simply stops playing, I could make the last user who moved the winner, by a 'longest chain' rule after max_finish.
Basically, I use HTCL but instead of using a hash to unlock, I use a valid chain of signed turns. Do you find any error on this logic?","",""

If the next player doesn't answer within x minutes with a longer chain, that player is out. If he does provide a longer chain, the game resumes.
It's a little more complex than I would've liked, but it could work.","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

- Is all the data stored in memory? How do you manage to run programs with a lot of data ""updates""? Do you send old data to disk to free up RAM?
- Which would be a way of using cairo for scientific calculations? These types of algorithms need floats but the felt integer divisions prevents us from using them. Is the standard to use a struct to represent a number with scientific notation?
- How sophisticated is the assert instruction? Does it assign a value to a previously unassigned value if we use a polynomial of degree greater than 1 (and the value is not set by a hint)? Which result would it use? We can take x squared - 1 = 0 as an example
- How do you manage memory allocation? All the used memory has to be continuous, so if you have to make a memory allocation then, taking into account that new variables will use memory that comes after the memory allocated, you either have to allocate a large amount of memory, have the memory fragmented (the end of a fragment is a pointer to another fragment of, for example, a list, i don't know how this would affect cache optimizations), or have redundant previous instances of the initialized memory after just resising like a normal memory chunk would be resized
- How expensive is actually runing something in Cairo? It surprises me that we are using python as an example of a fast language. Is the execution of code generating a proof so slow that the Amdahls Law determines that the lack of speed of python is worth it's ease of usage?
- Is all memory initialized with 0?
- Are all variables a version of a mapping? I don't see in ex3 a place in which user_counters_storage is initialized as one. Is the felt treated as a mapping with a unique undefined key?

So, for example, if ap was 1, then [ap - 1] = [1 - 1] = [0], you are assigning a value to the cell in address 0, after that the instruction ap++ is executed, which is equivalent to ap = ap + 1, so ap changes it's value to 2. Then on the next line you assign a value to the memory address ap - 1, which is 2 - 1 = 1, you can see that, while before you were assigning a value to the address 0, now you are assigning to the address 1 even though you are still using ap - 1, so what you are implying is not happening.

In a nutshell:
The verifier is currently used (and usable) only by us, for two reasons 
1. there are no other prover software around, and ours is not public yet
2. verifying has a cost, and agregating programs to prove them makes much more sense economically

so SHARP is our Shared Prover, and it can receive and prove any cairo program

these proofs are then sent to the sharp verifier on L1

and the outputs of the cairo programs can be used on L1

But, Starknet currently also uses Sharp. 
So any programyou send to sharp will end up being verified on L1 probable around the same time StarkNet blocs get verified on L1","","üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (3),StarkNet (2)"

From docs, what I understood is cairo‚Äôs actual need of addition to the blockchain paradigm  is that , it helps to execute complex business logic on the inputs offchain instead of today‚Äôs case, where whole business logic is in the smart contract on chain itself thus making it unscalable and storage inefficient. So, this implies that, if we are to implement a AAVE equivalent in starknet, then states will be handled in the onchain contract( in L1) and we will mimic the similar execution logic like that of aave solidity contract in cairo(off-chain). So, if a user now wants to  call a deposit function through cairo contract , along with the inputs which the function needs, he(or the dapp ui ) needs to pass in the current state of the AAVE contract which is in mainnet?  Because that is state what we will be applying our business logic on. And during the construction of the proof, we will have initial state  and the final state after the execution of business logic on user inputs and that will be registered on the Fact Registry contract and finally the AAVE on the L1 can call isValid on the Fact registry and include that state transition in its state.  If we maintain the state in the cairo contract as well, what is the guarantee that it is always synchronized with the one on the L1 chain? If we only allow the users to  make the transactions through the cairo path, then it is possible I think. But if it done to support current implementation as well, then how this whole architecture can be formed?","",""

I'm working through the sample `ERC721_Metadata.cairo` and `ERC721_Metadata_Base` contract shown here https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc721/tree/main/contracts/token/ERC721

It looks like from what I can tell the `tokenUri` is set for each domain, and even though calling the `@view` function does take in a tokenId, calling to set the tokenUri does not and it's not clear to me how that mapping could exist otherwise. So I wanted to modify the contract to have a `token_id -> token_uri` mapping. Because of the way those mappings exist though, you need to provide both the `token_uri_len: felt` and `token_uri: felt*`  when writing them. This means it can only be done once, otherwise you'd need a specific `@storage_var` for every token that's minted, just to hold it's tokenuri. I was hoping to do something like 

```cairo
// Represents a tokenUri
struct TokenUri {
    // The length of the token bytes
    token_uri_len: felt,
    // The pointer to the beginning of the token uri bytes
    token_uri: felt*,
}

@storage_var
func token_uris(token_id: felt) -> (token_uri: TokenUri) {
}
```

But because of the `token_url: felt*`  pointer in that struct, it can't be used as a storage variable return type. It gives an error when I try to compile showing

```
starknet_contracts/ERC721_Metadata.cairo:29:36: The return type of storage variables must be a felts-only type (cannot contain pointers).

For every URI, because of the above, we need to have a way to store the length, and then a way to store the value **at each index of the byte array**, if we stop early then we don't have a complete picture.

The map is n*m in size, the algorithm we chose to solve this problem is called jump point search, which is characterized by the pruning of non-relevant cases.
The implementation is still in progress and while testing a method on testnet we encountered the following problem:
For instances where n=50 and m=50 (values that should be easily solved) we get the following error.
StarknetErrorCode.OUT_OF_RESOURCES.
The question related to this would be: what is the limit of steps and the memory capacity that is given in a transaction (we read that in testnet the limit of steps is 500k, is it correct?)
We are worried about having a stack overflow because of the amount of recursive calls that are executed inside the algorithm.

In Cairo, everything is a felt.
So depending on how you represent the string, you‚Äôll probably have to convert each digit of his tokenId to the relevant ascii represenation of that digit.
EG ‚Äú0‚Äù in Ascii is ‚Äú38"" in decimal.
So for token ‚Äú10‚Äù you will have to convert it to a felt array with [48, 38] with a recursive function and divisions
And you can look at the Open Zeppelin implementation to check how it is coded

"895328389299318866","eni7912","16/01/2023 4:26 pm","hey hey, 
I'm looking for how to create modular programs using Cairo.

I want to do something like this :
- Define an interface as a struct which takes functions pointers as members
```rust
struct MyInstance {
  function1:felt*,
  function2:felt*
}
```
- Define abstract functions for the interface, taking the interface implementation as an argument and calling the implementation function

```rust
func function1(instance:MyInstance, parameter:MyInput){
  // call instance.function1 with parameter as input 
}
```
- Import the arguments from their respective files
```rust
# file_1
struct MyInput{
  member_a:felt,
  member_b:felt,
}
==========
# file_2
struct MyInput{
  member_a:felt,
  member_b:felt,
  member_c:felt,
}
```

The problem is that if `function1` expects type `file_1.MyInput` it's not going to work with `file_2.MyInput`. I only want to use it as a redirection to the implementation function though...

In Solidity (L1), you can create a payload to send a message on L2 with strings by using the `abi.encodePacked` function. This function takes a list of parameters and encodes them into a byte array.

"307424769861615617","epizeuxius","07/02/2023 4:50 pm","How does the call_contract() handle caller address?

Elaboration: 
We have a modular smart contract which receives all calls and it calls specific libraries through library_call. One of these modules can interact with a separate modular smart contract which is used for integrations. Integration smart contract then again uses library calls to call its modules. We want some functions of integration smart contract to only be called by the owner of the 1st smart contract so we use assert_only_owner() but the value it is returning in get_caller_address() in assert_only_owner() is that of the user so this check is failing.

The logic is designed on the basis of msg.sender handling in solidity, need to confirm if call_contract() works the same way like call in solidity and not like delegatecall.","",""

I have successfully tested several configuration playing with `set_contract_address`, `set_caller_address` etc... But there is a last case I can't solve.

How can I get/set, in an integration test, the address of a specific contract?

For instance:
```
Contract1::construct();
// after this construct, is there a way I set an address for this contract specifically?
// I have tried to implement a test Contract1::get_my_address() where I set the address manually, but it always return 0.

// Why? To use this address in the call/ctor of other contract. And makes them interact. That'll open mocking implementation which can be so cool.
Contract2::construct(contract1_addr);
Contract2::my_call(); // << which under the hood calls Contract1.
```

I don't know if my question is well written, but the idea is that I see several testing functions which are very useful, but I can't find a way to achieve this.

Any guidance very welcomed!","",""

But seeing the amazing tooling in cairo-test, something like this should be possible even before thinking about using a devnet. If someone knows where I can search about this, please let me know I'll be super happy to contribute.

Or perhaps no choice, and the devnet is the one solving this. Which makes sense too.","",""
