ü•á In first place we had Glue, introducing abstraction contracts on target chains. Inheriting from AxelarGateway, these contracts allow developers to extend the reach of their own contracts across multiple blockchains:

ü•à In second place we had Intergalactic PioNEARing with Axelar, which combines  Near XCC (cross- contract calls from within Aurora EVM) with the power of Axelar's GMP to allow users in any EVM or Cosmos chain to make a cross-chain call to NEAR smart contracts:

ü•â In third place we had BeSafe, a secure and trustless cross-chain estate planning service for any EVM compatible chain on the Axelar network:

:rainbowcat: And, last but not least the Grand Prize winner of the main Olympihacks track was also build using Axelar! :Axelarstrong: 

InterPal won big, using Axelar to send interchain messages, tokens, and mint NFTs across 13 chains through chat! InterPal simplifies everything blockchain with an intuitive chatbot with cross-chain interoperability:
