It's not a big issue because I can put it in some wrapper and render the entire React app inside Angular.
However, it could be really nice if we could use just an iframe where we could pass our signer (web3 provider) and provider (or rpc url) to this iframe.
I'm really ignorant about possible issues with passing messages between an iframe and parent context, but it could be nice to avoid having React dependencies inside Angular application. Moreover, it's would be nice to lazy load the iframe whenever needed.

EDIT:
Yes, it's not possible to share the signer/provider from the parent due to cross-origin limitation. We can only pass messages between our boundaries. Something like this could solve the issue: https://github.com/ethvault/iframe-provider (but it also concerns from security perspective).","",""

The bug also doesn't seem to be related to the props because the app crashes before I can see the console.log statement in the console. The only thing that fixes the problem is not including the SwapWidget component.

Also, I'm not using Gnosis. I'm using Wagmi.
I know the previous version of the uniswap widget (1.x.x) had some trouble with the Provider returned by Wagmi, which prompted us to disable the widget temporarily until a fix was on the horizon (it was a different bug than the one I am reporting currently). 

That being said, relating to this particular bug, I doubt it has anything to do with Wagmi or the wallet provider, because just having the widget with no props produces the bug, so that should exclude the wallet provider as a potential source of bug. ü§î","",""

The prop is not really usable in practice because it gets triggered regardless of the transaction. It would be more useful to have a callback function on successful swap, rather than ALL transctions.
For example, I want to close a modal when a swap is successful.
The problem is that if I use the `onTxSuccess` prop, the callback is triggered even for the `Approve` transaction that precedes a swap, thus closing the modal prematurely.

I want to use uniswap widget but getting this error in the chrome dev console:
```
Uncaught Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.

1. My project works with package from npm (when I build it with parcel, not vite). I use react 18 by the way.
2. I've removed all of my changes and tried to build last version on main branch (52960be)
3. Project builds only with yarn.lock (if I delete it, I got a lot of errors from ts. Like implicit any usages and so on. I don't genuinely understand how it ignores that errors.). If I update react to 18, types or smth else build fails.
4. So in case I use code as-is and build with `yarn && yarn build`. I got a dist, but if I add it to my project using link (pnpm link, exactly), I facing `invalid hooks usage error` (in TestableWidget component, but I think it doesn't matter)

I deployed the widget using react and the github demo and edited some of the code in App.js. Everything works fine when I am trying to swap with a common token. I am building the widget for a custom token, so I created a token list that is only the custom token and made it the default output token.
Everything works fine when swapping eth to dai, but when I try to swap eth to TETH, I get a gas estimation error in the javascript console of the browser and a very vague error in react.

I am working on a Vue application, with wallet integration (using web3-onboard and Ethers.js).
Now I need to embed the Uniswap Widget, which I'm struggling with. I've never done React in my life, but I am using the `veaury` package that helps me wrap it into Vue, and it does work, but now I'm struggling with more things.

Without giving any `provider` prop, it seems to detect it (right MATIC balance, right address, etc), though when I want to pass it manually, to ensure it uses the same as the rest of the app does, it triggers many errors, such as:
```Failed to get contract Error: invalid signer or provider (argument=""signerOrProvider"", value=""[object Object]"", code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=contracts/5.7.0)```
 An idea why my provider isn't recognized? My provider is of type `EIP1193`, and when I log it, it looks something like:
```Proxy(Object)¬†{_events: {‚Ä¶}, _eventsCount: 2, _maxListeners: 100, _log: l, _state: {‚Ä¶},¬†‚Ä¶}``` 

Of course all of that would be much easier if there were a Vue component for Uniswap, but the one I found was last updated 2 years ago and I couldn't get it to work üòÖ 
So far the React embedding is working but I'm unsure if my errors when passing props are due to my non knowledge of how React works, or other things that I might have missed, or due to me being some sort of noob in general.","",""

```js
import { SwapWidget } from '@uniswap/widgets'

// my variables here... etc

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className=""Uniswap"">
      <SwapWidget
        theme={myTheme}
        tokenList={MY_TOKEN_LIST}

        defaultChainId={chainID}
        // provider={provider}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
Then I import this React component into my Vue app, where I transform it using the `veaury` library:
```js
<script setup lang=""ts"">
import App from '@/react_app/uniswap-react.jsx' // This is the React component
import { applyPureReactInVue } from 'veaury'
import { defineComponent } from 'vue'

const Swap = defineComponent(applyPureReactInVue(App))
</script>

<template>
  <Swap />
</template>
```
So far it displays properly, even got my selected tokens to work (only when I hardcode my list though, i still have to figure it out), but my provider errors. If I remove the `provider` prop it seems to work alright, I just wanted to make sure I pass the right data. Maybe it is not necessary though. I didn't test the swapping yet, as I have no tokens to swap, but i'll do later. Still having no success in production though, it breaks the entire app because `TypeError: n.BigInt is not a function`, but I have no idea where it stems from, since it doesn't do that when I run my project locally!","",""
