In theory, you can develop front-end in any language including SwiftUI. The back-end logic however runs inside the Cartesi Machine, our VM based on RISC-V architecture. Hence, it is important to know that the language in question can be cross-compiled to RISC-V. It seems that it can be pulled off with Swift but not going to be an easy path!","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

"615539144638070784","carlofragni","26/10/2022 7:24 pm","From your logs, seems like you had an issue when building your server manager container. Checking the logs of it there is an error ""finish_error_yield_none"" from the start. 

Since your logs don't have a hardhat container, I'm assuming you are trying to deploy on testnet. When deploying on testnet the 1st thing you should do is build the Cartesi Machine (as its hash is needed for deploying the DApp smart contract). You do this using the `docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl -f docker-bake.override.hcl machine --load` command. Once the machine is built it's time to have the DApp Smart contract created. This is done by defining some environment variables with the parameters to connect to the blockchain, for example:
```
export NETWORK=goerli
export MNEMONIC=<user sequence of twelve words>
export RPC_URL=https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/<USER_KEY>
```
and then using the command to deploy the contract, for example: `DAPP_NAME=pipo docker compose -f ./deploy-testnet.yml up`

At this point the next step is initializing your server manager container. When you initialize the server manager container, it boots the Cartesi Machine and provides a special input as the 1st input ever. This input contains the address of the own DApp, you should handle this in a way that makes sense to your application (store on a database, file, hashmap, etc) as you'll need it to validate inputs coming from the portal, for instance. After handling it, it's expected for your application to yield (by calling the /finish HTTP endpoint). The error you are getting suggests me that during this initialization process, your application did not successfully yield, probably because it crashed. Do take a look at the server manager initialization output as it prints the output of the Cartesi Machine booting and also the outcome (cartesi machine yield).","",""

I have gone through the README.md step by step, but at no point does it talk about building the server manager container. At least not separately. Is it not built when I run the validator node with the command 
`DAPP_NAME=<example> docker compose -f ../docker-compose-testnet.yml -f ./docker-compose.override.yml up`? At least on the docker desktop, there is a container called server_manager-1. This is the container with the `concurrent call in session` error, apparently because of some RPC lock related issue. Another thing I realized is that the dispatcher container continuously restarts.

But then, what I did notice were some alerts/warnings in docker when running the validator with the AMD64 caption. I was investigating, and although there was nothing too suspicious, I finally decided to start all over again with a Linux laptop (Lenovo E495 Ubuntu 20.04LTS). It turned out that everything worked as expected and I was able to deploy, run the validator node and interact with the dapp from the frontend-cli.

"886909209629835264","riseandshaheen","21/04/2023 8:22 pm","Okay so, Cartesi is a rollup solution that means you can port assets(like erc20) from base layer ethereum to your rollup dApp. You can create a mintable erc20 contract on Ethereum and use the same contract coupled with your application logic inside Cartesi rollup. You can retrieve the coins of a dApp wallet by an `inspect` api call to the cartesi machine, it can generate a `report` stating the balance of the wallet in question. This will be a part of your application logic and you'll have to define it.
Let me see if I can find an example to your specific case but for starters here's a basic erc20 example that you can refer https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/erc20","",""
"268571938799091714","lyorrei","21/04/2023 8:33 pm","Thank you for your answer Shaheen!
So that means that I still have to write a solidity contract and deploy it on the mainnet, but I can refer to it inside the Cartesi Machine and execute more complex algorithms right? For example, I can run an AI that returns how many coins should be minted based on an input that is coming from a frontend. Can you confirm me that?
Other question, how can I execute the mint function of an ERC20 contract deployed in the mainnet from the cartesi machine?","",""
"886909209629835264","riseandshaheen","23/04/2023 9:34 pm","Yeah, you refer to the contract on chain and execute more complex algorithms inside the cartesi machine. I'm not aware of the whole application that you're building, but what you mentioned can be possibly achieved.
For the mint functionality, on-chain part, I believe the erc20 contract in question should be ""mintable"" type and you'll have to give minting rights to the rollup dapp address. Inside the Cartesi rollup backend of your dApp, you'll process the input with the AI/ML logic and then you'll have to make a `voucher` api call that will target our erc20 contract with payload as per your requirement.

Cartesi rollups is an infrastructure layer that allows you to run complex dApps without compromising the security of a base layer like Ethereum. This infrastructure has multiple components, for instance handling inputs, outputs, managing assets, dispute resolution etc. At the heart of it lies the Cartesi machine, which is where the core logic(backend) of your dapp runs. You may refer to it as the ""execution environment"" or the ""virtual machine"" of the Cartesi rollups. Say you build a game on Cartesi, your on-chain component will fetch the input from the user and the game logic/rules would run inside the Cartesi machine. 
Hope that adds some clarity. I'd suggest to get your hands dirty, build something and each component will unfold in front of you.","","üöÄ (1)"

You can use portal smart contract function `depositEther` to send ether from front-end to the Cartesi DApp. Depending on your back-end logic and conditions to withdraw, you can create a `voucher`.
Please refer to this frontend example dapp, it has multiple features including deposit and withdrawals, will help you to build front-end part. https://github.com/prototyp3-dev/frontend-web-cartesi/blob/54cc41ac3592078197e5d56c528ae4d7db4a7a44/src/Input.tsx#L68

For back-end you may refer to this https://github.com/prototyp3-dev/echo-plus/blob/main/dapp/echo-plus.py There are no special conditions to voucher creation, it simply transfers the assets back to the depositor hence the name ""echo"". You can modify it. Note: This backend is built on rollups-0.8, so I'd suggest using the correct method names for rollups-0.9.
