Together with **StarkNet Alpha mainnet release** next week we will be delivering enhanced version of **StarkNet Block Explorer - Voyager**!
Here is what you can expect from this release:

**Features**
* Contact verification
* Cross layer messages
* Supporting multiple networks: MainNet and Goerli
* Supporting both hex and decimal formats for contract interactions
* Improved search capabilities
* UI layout improvements

**Fixes**
* Properly handling contract addresses coming from StarkNet CLI (without leading 0's)
* Properly handling non-existent blocks, transactions, messages and contracts by displaying dedicated 'Not found' page

We appreciate any feedback on your experience with Voyager. Stay tuned.
Voyager Team.","","👏 (9)"

When using a `read` command, and the result contains a mixed combination of felts and arrays, I am seeing the explorer only return single values, rather than arrays:

https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x033668cdcf20672e4ce91652162888953474dee21c13ca9bdbea658f4b8f9059#readContract","","☑️ (1),🚀 (1),✅ (1)"

```
1, 2, 3 
3
1, 2, 3 
3
```
The result should have some arrays: e.g., the third return value should be an array. In the CLI the results are returned appropriately, so I imagine it is a parsing issue in Voyager. Perhaps it is to do with long arrays (e.g., 96).","",""

"743395542196944977","perama","30/11/2021 6:53 pm","I don't have a preference for how the arrays are returned (e.g., comma separated, space separated). 

This particular function returns variable length arrays, so the return values have the standard naming scheme: `array_name_len` preceding the `array_name`. I imagine that the most user friendly approach would be to have Voyager backend digest the length of the array, but not display it to the user.

For example, the CLI might return an array with length 5: `5 20 21 22 23 24`. The user probably only wants to see `20 21 22 23 24`

Here is the specific function for the contract I linked previously:

"869857057401081868","bartleg","13/12/2021 11:01 pm","Hello Voyagers!

We have some news to share. Following recent v.0.6.2 (https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/793094838509764621/919892930234286150) announcement we can share that a **new version of Voyager is available on Goerli**
🔗  https://goerli.voyager.online/
It will be also soon available on Mainnet.

**Improvements**

✅ **Pending block**: Mainnet blocks are closed at a 2h rate, this means that once a new pending block is seen on Voyager, it will take at least 2h until something new can be displayed again. With this advancement, Voyager can present also transactions from a block being built.
✅ **Hexadecimal values supported in the read and write contract calls**: The user can now provide input data to the read and write contract functions in two forms: decimal and hexadecimal (0x prefix). It is available for simple numeric fields. Implementation in array arguments will follow.
✅ **Minor UI improvements**

**Issues fixed**

✅ Redirection to prod even for the transaction madeon Goerli (contract function)
✅ Double contract source code displayed
✅ Wrong message hash calculating

Looking forward to your feedback!

New Voyager Block Explorer (v0.6.2) is already on **Mainnet**!

**Fixed bugs**
    
🐦Redirection to prod even the ttransacgtion was on Goerli (contract function)
🐦Double contract source code displayed
🐞Wrong message hash calculating
🐞Duplicate transaction/message bug 
🐞Invalid redirection in tabs after right click
 
**Improvements**
    
⭐ **Last pending block**: Mainnet blocks are closed at a 2h rate, this means that once a new pending block is seen on Voyager, it will take at least 2h until something new can be displayed again. With this advancement, Voyager can present also transactions from a block being built.
    
 🚀 **Hexadecimal values supported in the read and write contract calls**: The user can now provide input data to the read and write contract functions in two forms: decimal and hexadecimal (0x prefix). It is available for simple numeric fields. Implementation in array arguments will follow. 
    
⭐ **Enable searching in Verify Contract address field**: implemented a contract searching capability in the ""Contract"" address field on the ""Verify contract"" page.
    
⭐ **Add search by Message Hash to the search bar:** The user can now search by message hash from Voyager's search bar.
    
⭐ **Messages in Block details:** ""Block details"" page has new tab showing all messages correlated with this block
    
🚀  **Presenting arrays returned from write contract function calls**
    
🚀  **When presenting search results the first result is highlighted:** This allows for selecting with a single enter press when there is an exact match (i.e. when pasting a complete hash) 

We are looking forward to your feedback.

After inspecting the network requests made, **__it turns out when using hex format, there's an error converting the hex format into decimal__**: all digits after the first 16 are zero, as shown in the attached screenshot.

Steps to reproduce:
1. go to https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x07394cbe418daa16e42b87ba67372d4ab4a5df0b05c6e554d158458ce245bc10#readContract

New Voyager Block Explorer (v0.7) is already on **Goerli**!

**Improvements**

⭐ **ArgentX** wallet integration
⭐ **Hex/decimal switch**: integrated a switch button that allows the users to choose if the response in contract function should be in hexadecimal or decimal format.
⭐ **L1 L2 Messages Tab**: improved and unified the view inside Messages tab (in transaction details), both L2 L1 and L1 L2.
⭐ **Support for struct arrays:** implemented an external function that receives/returns a struct array and allows the contract to be compiled. What it means from Voyager is to support the ability to input/output struct arrays in the read/write pages.
⭐ **UI:** minor improvements

**Fixed bugs**

🐞 Duplicated messages with wrong internal information
🐞 UI bug with long contract address: fixed a UI bug that was displaying too many zeros for deployed contracts.
🐞 Error 400 when validating contract: fixed a bug that was giving “400 error - The code does not match"" when trying to verify contract on Goerli.
🐞 Fixed parsing of hexadecimal numbers in contract functions

We are looking forward to your feedback.

"213155311073230848","jerryho","25/02/2022 8:14 pm","Reason of asking this question: was thinking about setting up a starknet full node for goerli testnet, in order to sync ledger and observe/follow/trace their behavior. It's boring and not efficient by only reading specs..

(also don't feel comfortable interacting with argentx/starknet cli only - it's like we're fully relying on infura 100%, if it's boom like the previous eth parity bug, then it's doomed, not a fan of it.)

But I guess it's just that it's not been released as of yet (I saw the r&d progress is ongoing, very understandable), so in the meantime I can only rely on voyager anyway.

===
Question:
Is the design of ""block explorer Voyager only showing originating transactions from that contract, but not showing transactions targeting that contract"" intended? Or it's just that it's undergoing development, so with lower priority?

Last Friday we had a release of a new version of Voyager which included the following features:

✅ Read functions with ArgentX - so far it was only possible to use write functions with ArgentX. Now we have extended this functionality and made it possible to use the read functions in the same way.
✅  When parsing transaction data according to the ArgentX convention:
    - Function name visible.
    - Possibility to convert each parameter separately.
✅  Supporting contract verification with multiple source files - now it is possible to verify the contract by importing multiple source files.
✅  Added redirection from not verified contracts to verification page.
✅  Added an information on read/write functions when the contract is not verified.
✅  Added error reason on rejected transactions.

The changes are available on both goerli and mainnet.
We appreciate any feedback on your experience with Voyager!

2. possible transaction statuses are: 
- `NOT_RECEIVED` - The transaction has not been received yet.
- `RECEIVED` - The transaction was received by the operator.
- `PENDING` - The transaction passed the validation and is waiting to be sent on-chain.
- `REJECTED` - The transaction failed validation and thus was skipped.

When I am building URL for transactions hash via `…/tx/{tx_hash}` it works just fine but in case of pasting the contract address directly to the `.../contract/{address}` sometime it works, and sometimes it does not.
If I paste the uppercase address, it shows the contract is in <pending> state and nothing more, even though those two are the same exact addresses. Isn’t it supposed to work just fine for both cases? Is the letter casing here the issue? Thanks in advance

I looked at the contract and the function that you mentioned above and everything is fine. Let me elaborate:
`get_tokens` function is:
`{
     ""inputs"": [
          {
               ""name"": ""certificate_id"",
               ""type"": ""Uint256""
          }
     ],
     ""name"": ""get_tokens"",
     ""outputs"": [
          {
               ""name"": ""tokens_len"",
               ""type"": ""felt""
          },
          {
               ""name"": ""tokens"",
               ""type"": ""Token *""
          }
     ],
     ""stateMutability"": ""view"",
     ""type"": ""function""
},`
as the output of this function is `tokens_len` of `felt` type and `tokens` of `Token*` type
where the `Token` structure looks like this:
`{
     ""members"": [
          {
               ""name"": ""token_standard"",
               ""offset"": 0,
               ""type"": ""felt""
          },
          {
               ""name"": ""token"",
               ""offset"": 1,
               ""type"": ""felt""
          },
          {
               ""name"": ""token_id"",
               ""offset"": 2,
               ""type"": ""Uint256""
          },
          {
               ""name"": ""amount"",
               ""offset"": 4,
               ""type"": ""Uint256""
          }
     ],
     ""name"": ""Token"",
     ""size"": 6,
     ""type"": ""struct""
}`

so finally as the output we have: `tokens_len` and structure `Token` (token_standard (felt), token (felt), token_id (Uint256), amount (Uint256))
The output data is:
0: ""0x1""
1: ""0x1""
2: ""0x7ecb8571cdcfa12d5f3869eb154e093abfd8ef97c93b97fb5c9ed33806831d5""
3: ""0x8""
4: ""0x0""
5: ""0x0""
6: ""0x0""

So finally we have:
0: ""0x1"" `tokens_len`
1: ""0x1"" `token_standard`
2: ""0x7ecb8571cdcfa12d5f3869eb154e093abfd8ef97c93b97fb5c9ed33806831d5"" `token`

"609470900445642789","kasiagankiewicz#8410","12/08/2022 3:14 pm","Hi @BRRoy, coming with the answers 🙏 :
*I can’t find the link for checking my Token balances.*
Token balance is a feature that will be introduced in Voyager soon.

*I can’t see my incoming transactions. I funded my wallet with Layerswap but I don’t see the tx in my transaction history.*
At the moment, Voyager offers only deploy and invoke (interactions with the contract) transactions. We also have captured to add other (deposits) transactions in the future.

*Accounts deployed with Braavos or ArgentX (Verified and Live wallet providers) are tagged as “Not Verified”. (Not a big issue)*
Could you provide some examples of addresses? We will investigate this.

*I see the tx fee but not the amount transacted.*
Also we have a plan to display more information in transaction details.

*Transaction Types are mainly “INVOKE”. More tags will be helpful (deposit, approve, withdraw…)*
As above, at the moment in Voyager, we have developed two types of transactions:
- deploy - transaction related to deploying the contract
- invoke - a transaction related to the interaction of the contract,
we are planning deposit transactions soon. 
As for the names (deploy, invoke), they are the original names of the transaction types that come from StarkNet.

🔎 You can now explore L1 transactions related to state update or bridge transactions within Voyager! 

🌉 Use your L1 transaction hash to follow your bridge transaction straight into your account. The “bridge txns” tab in your account contract lists all bridge transactions made through StarkGate

🔢 Voyager now supports event decoding. No more cryptic events - know exactly what event information is being emitted by a contract.

🔗 a separate tab on contract page
🔗 account call details 

Take a deeper dive into the core of user activity on Starknet👇 
https://voyager.online/account-calls

Why Account Calls? 🧐
On ETH L1, with an EOA (Externally Owned Accounts), transactions directly call contracts, there’s no intermediaries.

On Starknet, you’re not sending a transaction directly to the contract that you want to call. Instead, you call the execute function of your Account Contract, meaning you’re sending the transaction to your own Account Contract, so it doesn’t show up in the TX page of the contract called. 

More info https://twitter.com/0xvoyageronline/status/1671131635339739136?s=20

The Account Calls table shows these interactions between Account Contract and the contract called.

You can now check your reverted transactions on Goerli on https://goerli.voyager.online/ 🔥

With the upcoming Starknet v0.12.1 upgrade, failed txs will be included in blocks
✅ Devs, no more constant monitoring of txs statuses before starting new ones
✅ Sequencer booost as it won't waste resources on failed tx

"1138759348147990529","th0rgal.","03/09/2023 3:00 pm","Hello there,

I am trying to call a cairo 2 contract from voyager but I keep getting:
``Execution was reverted; failure reason: 0x4661696c656420746f20646573657269616c697a6520706172616d202331.
``

Where the failure reason translates to ""Failed to deserialize param #1"".

The function interface I am trying to call is:
```rs
fn standard_multicall(self: @TContractState, calls: Array<Call>) -> Array<Span<felt252>>;
```
And the Call interface is the following:
```rs
#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
struct Call {
    to: ContractAddress,
    selector: felt252,
    calldata: Array<felt252>
}
```

The only value it seems to work with is an empty array (calldata 0). When I try to get the result of an actual call like ``totalSupply()`` of the ``ether`` erc20 contract, it doesn't work.

Here is what I tried:
```1, 0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7, 0x80aa9fdbfaf9615e4afc7f5f722e265daca5ccc655360fa5ccacf9c267936d, 0
```
Which means:
```

Here are my findings from your inputs, 
The contract works as expected, and when I checked with a raw call via the RPC, it works as expected.
Here's Curl:
```curl --location --request POST 'https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/call_contract?blockNumber=pending' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{

On the Voyager side, Found a bug when sending it as a raw, it was appending the length also which was causing weird issue, We understand that with the new cairo version the inputs can be complex, and we are working on making it simple for struct to input within voyager.
This issue mentioned above will be patch fixed soon, and you will hear us on a form abi tooling for simpler ui for contract inputs from us soon. Thanks for reporting, keep voyaging 🔥","",""

We understand it's not a proper fix, and we are working on a proper fix for cairo 2 with complex structs to input with validation inbuilt for types.
