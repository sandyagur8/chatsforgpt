"368420164540170241","janek26","05/01/2022 3:08 pm","Hey guys! Had to catch some sleep

As there are no EOAs in StarkNet Signers are the only way to interact (write) with the blockchain, instances can sign data, verify those signatures and commit given transactions to a given address, which need to implement a wallet-contract interface as defined by openzeppelin. The 2 implementations for that are openzeppelins account contract and argents account contract afaik.

**Please note you wont be able to make transactions without going through a wallet contract in the future, as revealed yesterday in the community call**
While you can still write to the blockchain directly right now, this will change in the future, so it's better to be prepared today. (Contract deployment wont be effected by this change for now)

If you want the most basic signer (should work in node too) you need to generate a keypair, deploy a account contract, and initialize a Signer with that keypair and wallet contract address.","",""
"368420164540170241","janek26","05/01/2022 3:08 pm","```
// generate random key pair. You can also get a key pair from a private key using `getKeyPair(pk: BigNumberish)`
const keyPair = ec.genKeyPair();

const deployWalletTx = await defaultProvider.deployContract(
COMPILED_WALLET_CONTRACT_JSON,  // compiled JSON (should be imported as a string, as native JS parsing destroys its data)
                                // get it from ie checking out https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Account.cairo and building it. You need the compiled contract json
[ec.getStarkKey(keyPair)],      // arguments to the contract constructor, containing the stark public key here
0,                              // seed, defaults to a random value, so you never get a transaction hash collision
);

// wait for wallet to be deployed
await defaultProvider.waitForTx(deployWalletTx.transaction_hash);

// initialize the signer with the wallet address and key pair
const signer = new Signer(defaultProvider, deployWalletTx.address, keyPair);

// done, you can now:
// read (callContract, can also be done the same with just the default provider)
// and write (sendTransaction, will be passed through the account contract) with the signer now
``` 

Now you got a wallet and a signer to interact with it, I'll answer @petepetepete 's question how to authenticate to other contracts.
You cant pass a signature through the wallet contract yet, as it consumes the signature itself, but this may change in the future.

Until then (and I guess also after that) we can fallback to a more well known pattern, checking the senders address (just like in solidity).
You can do so using https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/calling_contracts.html#getting-the-caller-address
In you method was not called through a wallet contract (or any other contract) this method will return `0`","","üëè (3)"

please have a look at a proposal of mine regarding human readable interfaces for starknet.js v3
It would help a lot, as people implementing these interfaces (especially Signer), like Argent X, could show much more data to the end user while approving. This would also apply to Hardware Wallets, once they integrate starknet. With these changes they would be able to show more data on what you're currently signing etc.

Feedback very much appreciated

What's the difference between StarkEx and StarkNet?
StarkEx is a standalone system for exchanges that uses the STARK proof system in order to provide scalability for the exchanges using it. See above for a list of exchanges already using StarkEx in production on Ethereum mainnet.
See https://starkware.co/product/starkex/

StarkNet is a general-purpose system, where you can write and deploy your own contracts, interact with other contracts, and so on, just like Ethereum.
See https://starkware.co/product/starknet/

Have a good day

There are couple of ways you can invoke or call function.
The easiest is call it directly on the contract.

`const response = contract.balanceOf(wallet)`
or 
`cont response = contract.invoke('balanceOf', [wallet])`

also arguments can be numbers, array of numbers, objects or array of object. That's why we changed to `any`

We made Contract interface to be similar to ethers.js.

If I call the same contract using starknet-js using either of these methods:
```
const result = (await this._simpleContract.functions.get_pixels());
const result = (await this._simpleContract.call('get_pixels'))
```

I get the following (I'm using Webpack and Chrome)
```
[Array(100), pixels: Array(100)]
0: (100) [n, n, n, n, n, ...]

But in reality the `transaction` and `transaction_receipts` are arrays. So look at my code, it gives an error `Types of property 'transactions' are incompatible.`
```

        const transactions = await blockAnalyzer.organizeTransactions(_block); // ERROR Types of property 'transactions' are incompatible.

Because I have to work with an array, which I get back in reality. But the type inside starknetjs is an object. Dumb question maybe but how can I cast the block as a `GetBlockResponse` with arrays ?

1) I'm using ArgentX on the frontend to sign a message via signMessage() and obtain a signature.
2) I'm able to call hashMessage() to obtain the message hash, and later verify it via a contract call to is_valid_signature().
This works great!

My problem is that, I could either:
A. Send the message and the signature to the server. In this case, I would need to recalculate the hash and verify it via is_valid_signature(). But I don't know how to recalculate the hash server-side, and it seems like hashMessage() returns a different hash for every different signer.
B. Send the message, the hash and the signature to the server. In this case, I would be able to verify that the hash is valid, but I would still need a way to verify that the hash corresponds to the message.

Anyone has any tip to guide me to a solution? Thanks!","",""

I have successfully deployed an OZ account contract and with that account contract set up a provider to deploy an ERC20 contract and mint some initial tokens during the deployment. It's an ownable contract with the owner set to the address of the deploying account in this instance. (Ref: https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x06c1a9f74fb414bef45d1ca8867f30a94f8d1839c471aef878258c636d24abf4). I have also done this previously and set the owner during the deployment to an account in my Argent X wallet. I can interact with the contract through Voyager to mint and transfer tokens successfully.

I am now trying to use the execute method on the account to mint further tokens but, I keep striking this error `response: [Object: null prototype] { tx_status: 'NOT_RECEIVED' }`. I have tried a number of permutations on the execute method to see if I could crack it, without success. Currently the code looks like this, pared back from what I had:
```
const {transaction_hash: mintTxHash} = await account.execute(
  {

I'm trying to invoke a function of a contract using this code : 
```js
        const { transaction_hash: transferTxHash } = await account.execute(

                contractAddress: eykarCommunityContract.address,

            undefined,
            { maxFee: ""0"" }
        );
```
But I get this error: 

```js
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')
    at Account.<anonymous> (/home/nicolas/Desktop/Nico/eykar/API/node_modules/starknet/dist/account/default.js:125:92)
```

So I went to /home/nicolas/Desktop/Nico/eykar/API/node_modules/starknet/dist/account/default.js:125:92

the error is here:
```js
    Account.prototype.getNonce = function () {
        return __awaiter(this, void 0, void 0, function () {
            var result;
            return __generator(this, function (_a) {
                switch (_a.label) {
                    case 0: return [4 /*yield*/, this.callContract({
                            contractAddress: this.address,
                            entrypoint: 'get_nonce',
                        })];
                    case 1:
                        result = (_a.sent()).result;
                        // I Added a console.log
                        console.log(_a.sent())
                        return [2 /*return*/, (0, number_1.toHex)((0, number_1.toBN)(result[/* THIS IS THE ERROR */0]))];
                }
            });
        });
    };
```

So I printed the source of the ""result"" variable in the console (_a.sent()), and I get this: 

```js
[Object: null prototype] {
  code: 'StarkErrorCode.MALFORMED_REQUEST',
  message: ""can't use a string pattern on a bytes-like object""
}
```
So there's definitely something I missed (this is the first time I've done this). If you have an idea of the problem, don't hesitate.

a. attempt to silently connect with a wallet
b. if failed, show the ""connect a wallet"" button/UI to your users/

My understanding is that it would better have been called `4.0.0-alpha`. If your rule for starknet in your package.json is ^3.x with x<=18, you might get bite. The move to the `latest` tag to v4.4.2 should not have impacted your code.... except that it has.

If you run npm install from scratch, you get the 3.19 (19 > 18) and not 3.18... if you do that, your package will (likely) be broken. A quick fix is to block the version (if you are running starknet-js 3) to 3.18.2.

`invoke` like in `invokeFunction` on the Provider ? 
1- There is nothing wrong about using strings. You should use string as you can see from the type that is used in the `invokeFunction` here https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js/blob/b4785793ea912dc8562de4c69b0dcbda4358e144/src/types/lib.ts#L20
2- The correct way to proceed (assuming you want to write to the blockchain) would be (1) create an account and (2) `execute` a contract function from that account. But before that, did you connect to your wallet? How did you do that? The way it works is the transaction needs to be signed by the user and the easiest way is definitely to ask your wallet to sign it for you.
3- You also need to check the version of starknet-js. What version are you using?
4- If you are stuck, there are several things you could do: (1) find an example and make sure it works; (2) explain where you are stuck (3) provide the code extract and the exact error message you get in details","",""

I'm pretty sure that the signature it's right. I have only another doubt related to the public key: to get the public key, I used a snippet that @okuyiga shared (thanks a lot for doing this man!), the following one: 
`
  const pubKey = ec.ec.curve
    .pointFromX(number.toBN(opts.publicKey))
    .encode(true, 'hex');

I got a quick question. When you load the compiled contract to run a Deploy with Starknet-js on the sequencer, we have (at least with OZ 0.3.2) to use  `json`  that you provide, otherwise we are hit with https://community.starknet.io/t/while-deploying-code-i-get-the-error/1294/4 . 

My understanding is that is has to do with the way BN are stored in the JSON. Is it still relevant with cairo v0.10 compiler because I managed to deploy the OZ 0.4.0b without  `json`?

You are maybe aware that soon StarkNet will not allow free deployments of Accounts. 
That is why we modified and updated our workshop repo, which you can check out on how to adapt your flow: https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js-workshop
It uses the newest Account and ERC20 OpenZeppelin contacts. 
For an example that uses the Argent Account contract check out: https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js-account
For the theory check out this guide: https://starkware.notion.site/Deploy-a-contract-and-an-account-on-StarkNet-ed2fd13301d2414e8223bb72bb90e386

1. You can't pass numbers, objects and arrays together as parameters. You have to prepare them.
2. Take care that if the smart-contract recovers the address of your account, you have to use Account.execute.

With only the keyPair, you can't!
But if you know the Salt value used at the creation of the account, you can calculate the account address.
Generally, the Salt is equal to the pubKey.

```typescript
const OZaccountConstructorCallData = stark.compileCalldata({ publicKey: starkKeyPub });

People are using blockchain explorer, like etherscan, voyager or starkscan. They have the feeling that a blockchain is a SQL database that can be queried in all imaginable ways.
In reality, a blockchain is the worst architecture if you want to query its content (it has other advantages that explains its success).
You can't perform such query directly with Starknet.js. You can only have data from a particular block, not from the whole block-chain.
Blockchain explorers are in real time extracting  the new blocks, and copy them in their local SQL type database. Then you can consult and query this database ; you have just to trust that this database is really a perfect copy of the blockchain.","",""

This version is compatible with Cairo-lang 0.12.1 (so with Cairo 2.1.0).
Cairo has introduced new types of data, that are now correctly handled :
- Span : You can send and receive Spans with JS Array type.
- EthAddress : A BigNumberish with 160 bits maxi.
- ContractAddress : A BigNumberish with 251 bits maxi.
- ClassHash : A BigNumberish with 251 bits maxi.
But the most important new type introduced is Enum. 3 types of Enums are valid :
- Option
- Result
- Custom Enum
If a Cairo 2.1.0 function returns a` Result<u8,u16>` with `Result::Ok(200)`, the response in Starknet.js will be an instance of the new `CairoResult` class, for example :
```typescript
const contractResult = await myTestContract.test() as CairoResult<BigNumberish, BigNumberish>;
```
Then you can use this instance in your JS/TS code in a similar way to Cairo :
```typescript
const isSuccess: boolean = contractResult.isOk(); // true
const value: bigint = contractResult.unwrap(); // 200
```
A complete Enums guide has been written here : https://www.starknetjs.com/docs/next/guides/cairo_enum","","üôè (1)"

I checked this afternoon :
- Alchemy : not yet compatible.
- Infura : not yet compatible.
- Devnet 0.6.0a0 : not yet compatible.
The only compatible node is your own local Pathfinder 0.7.0 node, connected to ""http://127.0.0.1:9545/rpc/v0.4"".

Inside Starknet, a Cairo contract can invoke a Cairo function that returns a result.
The Starknet API defines the rules to invoke and call the Cairo functions from outside of Starknet. The API do not authorize to return a result of an invoke.
So, from outside of Starknet, you can solve this problem by :
- Your `create_post` function stores the result in the contract. Then a call function read the storage and returns the result.
- Your `create_post` function  emits the result in an events. Then you can read the event, using the txHash.","","üî• (1)"

@Phil26 
some stats on my side. about the fee error. one week ago failure rate maybe 1%, recent 3days failure rate 25%. maybe it's the result of volatile market. suggest we do some monitoring about this and optimize some network connection or prediction. 

say, when market turns volatile, we can improve the update frequency. I tend to we can do a little bit more margin on starknet.js to make it less likely to fail. as there is lillte downside of this, isn't it?","",""

It seems that you have some habits from Ethereum, right?
In opposition to Ethereum, Starknet do not have a hard coded token to pay fees, so there is no ""account getBalance"".
In Starknet, an ERC 20 contract is managing the fee token, called ETH. So balance of ETH has to be managed as all other ERC20 contracts.

A regenesis of the Starknet networks is planned at the end of the year. All Cairo 0 contracts will be deleted. Today, all popular account contracts are Cairo 0 (OpenZeppelin, ArgentX, Braavos).
For ArgentX and Braavos, they will ask you to approve an update of your accounts present in their wallet.
For all accounts not created in their wallets, it's your responsibility to have found a solution before the regenesis.

You can't query directly the block-chain for a such subject.
