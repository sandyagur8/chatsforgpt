"767746468542283827","fabijanspaceshard","30/11/2021 8:39 pm","Well the new changes which might require clarification are:
1) the ability to pass constructor input which is documented here: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin#starknet-deploy
it introduces the same `--inputs` option which is present in Starknet CLI command `deploy`, the only difference is that you have to quote the inputs, I think that's the only way of passing them all due to a strange limitation with how Hardhat works
That basically means if you want to pass two constructor arguments (e.g. 10 and 20) you would run this:
```
hh starknet-deploy <PATH_TO_CONTRACT> --starknet-network <NETWORK_NAME> --inputs ""10 20""
```","","💯 (1)"
"767746468542283827","fabijanspaceshard","30/11/2021 8:42 pm","2) the improved typing means that the `args` in e.g. `await contract.call(""foo"", args)` is no longer `any`, but an object whose keys are strings, representing the return values","","🤓 (1)"

- Have an Alpha Mainnet config entry the same way Alpha Testnet is present (i.e. `alpha` and `alphaMainnet` are available without defining in your hardhat config file; it was a bit late when it was realized that `alphaMainnet` is not the best choice, and future versions will have `alpha-mainnet` by default).
- Use cairo-lang v0.6.1 by default.
- When waiting for transactions to become `PENDING`, also check for their `block_hash` to become NOT `pending`.

Feature requests on hold, but hopefully one of them will be supported in the next version:
- usage of an existing venv instead of necessarily running a docker container
- verification task (voyager)","",""

I have a couple of q./suggestions re devnet:
1. devnet is much faster than testnet - no doubt, but still it is relatively slow to be used as a full fledged testing environment. I was wondering if there is an intrinsic reason for that (especially around reads), or is it just performance optimization you hadn't got around doing yet?
2. I noticed that devnet is using 100% CPU when processing txs, however only on a single core. Is it possible to separate the implementation, at least for reads, to be multithreaded? That way writes can queue up, but at lease reads will return almost instantly.","","💪 (3)"

https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/releases/tag/v0.1.17
- You can now save and load your Devnet instance to save setup time https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet#dumping.
- Supported `starknet get_full_contract` (`get_state_update` still pending).
- Improved L1-L2 communication (postman): https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/#postman-integration

Dump:
```
$ starknet-devnet --dump-path <PATH> --dump-on <WHEN>
```
Load:
```
$ starknet-devnet --load-path <PATH>

https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin/releases/tag/v0.4.2
- Introduce utility functions for handling L1-L2 communication (postman message exchange with Devnet): @maciejka 
  - `starknet.devnet.loadL1MessagingContract` - for loading an L1 contract that exchanges messages between L1 and L2
  - `starknet.devnet.flush` - for propagating messages to the other layer
  - Basic example: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin#test---l1-l2-communication-message-exchange-with-devnet
  - Complex example: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-example/blob/master/test/postman.test.ts#L91

- Introduce an `Account` class for invoking/calling contract functions through a Starknet account. Create `Account` using utility functions:
  - `starknet.deployAccountFromABI` - for new Account deployment
  - `starknet.getAccountFromAddress` - for loading a predeployed Account
  - Basic example: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin#test---accounts
  - Complex example: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-example/blob/master/test/account-test.ts

L1-L2 communication:
```typescript
await starknet.devnet.loadL1MessagingContract(...);
const l1contract = ...;
const l2contract = ...;

await l1contract.send(...); // depending on your L1 contract interaction library
await starknet.devnet.flush();

await l2contract.invoke(...);
await starknet.devnet.flush();
```

Account interaction:
```typescript
const contract = ...;
const account = await starknet.deployAccountFromABI(""Account"", ""OpenZeppelin"");
await account.invoke(contract, ""increase_balance"", { amount: 10 });
const { res } = account.call(contract, ""get_balance"");

    - `starknet-hardhat-plugin` should soon support these timestamps.

- Easier getting of account address (`account.address`)
- In CLI commands, `--signature` is fixed and now accepts multiple values
- `url` property made optional for hardhat network configs
- `dockerizedVersion` defaults to cairo-lang 0.8.2
- Integrated-devnet uses uses starknet-devnet v0.2.2 by default

https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/releases/tag/v0.2.3
- Supported starknet/cairo-lang v0.9.0 features:
  - `declare` - Contract class declaration
  - `get_class_hash_at`
  - `get_class_by_hash`
- Now predeploying a set of prefunded accounts:
  - [Docs](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/tree/v0.2.3#predeployed-accounts)
  - [New CLI options](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/tree/v0.2.3#run): `--accounts`, `--initial-balance`, `--gas-price`, `--seed`
- Transactions with max_fee set to 0 are **still allowed**.
- Using C++ implementation of pedersen hash for better performance.
- Fixed events property of transaction receipts (was missing when used through accounts).","","🔥 (3),👍🏻 (1)"

-   **On alpha-goerli**
    -   Deploy an account using `starknet.deployAccount`
    -   Give it finds through [the faucet](https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/)
    -   Later load the account using `starknet.getAccountFromAddress`
-   **On starknet-devnet**
    -   Since v0.2.3, Devnet comes with prefunded accounts which use the OpenZeppelin account implementation v0.1.0
    -   Use the data logged by Devnet on startup (address, key)
    -   Load one of the predeployed accounts using `starknet.getAccountFromAddress`
    -   [Read more](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet#predeployed-accounts)

Once your account has funds, you can specify a maximum fee greater than zero:
```typescript
await account.invoke(contract, ""foo"", { arg1: ... }, { maxFee: BigInt(...) });
```

`deployAccount` doesn't accept fees and currently works **without** them
`starknet-hardhat-plugin` not yet fully compatible with Starknet 0.9.0

- Introduced timestamp manipulation functions (Devnet only):
  - `starknet.devnet.setTime(1000)`
  - `starknet.devnet.increaseTime(500)`
- Added support for named tuples, nested tuples and type aliases as function arguments.
- Adapted to cairo-lang/starknet 0.9.0:
  - Introduced the `declare` method to the `StarknetFactory` class:
    - `const classHash = await contractFactory.declare()`
- Updated the Argent account version used (v0.2.2):
  - **BREAKING CHANGES**:
    - Guardian not used by default anymore (it's set to 0).
    - Initialization with a fundedAccount required after deployment:
      - `const acc = <ArgentAccount> await starknet.deployAccount(""Argent"")`
      - `await acc.initialize({ fundedAccount, maxFee })`
  - Useful scripts:
    - `deploy-argent.ts`: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-example/blob/9b3b43d6500386a116c9641dc473ad873cccd607/scripts/deploy-argent.ts
    - `transfer-funds.ts`: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-example/blob/9b3b43d6500386a116c9641dc473ad873cccd607/scripts/transfer-funds.ts
- Updated the OpenZeppelin account version used (OZ commit b27101eb8).
- Automatically fetching `-arm` docker images on arm64 computers.
- Fixed support for interaction with Devnet on WSL and mac when used with the dockerizedVersion of the plugin.
- Adapted to the new Voyager verification API.
- Added support for relative paths as arguments to `getContractFactory`.
- `integrated-devnet` - [docs](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin#runtime-network---integrated-devnet):
  - Not marked as experimental anymore.
  - Added `args` property to `integratedDevnet` hardhat config definition to allow passing Devnet CLI arguments (e.g. `--lite-mode`).","","🔥 (6)"

- integrated-devnet changes:
  - Fixed error and exit handling.
  - Using starknet-devnet v0.2.5 by default
- Updated used OpenZeppelin account artifacts to v0.2.0
- Supported event decoding ([example](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin/tree/v0.6.1#transaction-information-and-receipt-with-events)):
```typescript
    const txHash = await contract.invoke(""increase_balance"", { amount: 10 });

- Supported devnet-specific client utility functions:
  - `hardhat.starknet.devnet.load` - load a devnet instance via HTTP
  - `hardhat.starknet.devnet.dump` - dump a devnet instance via HTTP
  - `hardhat.starknet.devnet.getPredeployedAccounts` - get accounts predeployed on Devnet","","🙌 (3)"

1- ```

      dolvenVault,

Currently these txs are only accepted on `starknet-devnet` (latest Devnet version at the time of writing is 0.4.2), but Devnet will also soon deprecate them: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/issues/356
