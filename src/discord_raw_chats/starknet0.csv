`{""overall_fee"":16968000079184,""unit"":""wei"",""gas_price"":1500000007,""gas_usage"":1131}`
Namely, `amount` => `overall_fee` is a **breaking change.**

I created initial PR for it:
https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js/pull/248

Since `starknet-devnet` still doesn't support 0.9.1 I had to locally  patch it so tests will pass.","",""

You are maybe aware that soon StarkNet will not allow free deployments of Accounts. 
That is why we modified and updated our workshop repo, which you can check out on how to adapt your flow: https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js-workshop
It uses the newest Account and ERC20 OpenZeppelin contacts. 
For an example that uses the Argent Account contract check out: https://github.com/0xs34n/starknet.js-account
For the theory check out this guide: https://starkware.notion.site/Deploy-a-contract-and-an-account-on-StarkNet-ed2fd13301d2414e8223bb72bb90e386
NOTE: starknet.js guides are not yet up to date with these changes, but they will be very soon","",""
