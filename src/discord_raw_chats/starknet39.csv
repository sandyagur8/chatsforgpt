Then there is a Cairo language server and VS Code extension that I am developing https://github.com/ericglau/cairo-ls which mainly provides live diagnostic highlighting (and quick fixes) for compile errors, but more can be added (for example, hover-over for information and ctrl-click to go to definitions would be useful).

"743395542196944977","perama","21/10/2021 6:59 am","Hey everyone just want to flag an issue with stale cache with `pytest`. 

When using `pytest` to test contracts there is automatic generation of `__pycache__` dir, containing `.pyc` files that mean files don't have to be compiled for every unit test you run.

However, this can cause a problem where the test suite fails to recognise when a contract has been updated. In particular, one specific example I notice that when importing a local Cairo file (e.g, a custom module), the cache doesn't update if you you delete the module and bring the functions in to the calling contract. The pytest module still uses the compiled contract that uses the external module. 

One potential solution is to manually delete the `.pyc` files in this instance. Another might be to use something like:

https://pypi.org/project/pyclean/

- link: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin/releases/tag/v0.3.0","","🔥 (3)"
"767746468542283827","fabijanspaceshard","15/11/2021 5:40 pm","Changes:
- Enable passing constructor arguments (possible to pass them when calling `deploy` of a contract factory).
- Enable signing transactions.
- Rely on JS `BigInt` because Cairo's `felt` type might be too big for ordinary JS `Number`.
- Enforce typed/structured input and output (no more single-string function results; no more blindly passing sequences of numbers as function inputs).
- Fix Mac (OS X) support (when interacting with gateways listening on localhost, such as  `starknet-devnet`).

Examples:
Assume a contract with struct and function:
```text
struct Point:
    member x: felt
    member y: felt
end

func sum_points(p1: Point, p2: Point) -> (res: Point)
```
What used to look like:
```typescript
const resStr = await contract.call(""sum_points"", [1, 2, 3, 4]); // Point(1, 2) + Point(3, 4)
chai.expect(resStr).to.equal(""4 6""); // Point(4, 6)
```
now looks like:
```typescript
const { res } = await contract.call(""sum_points"", { p1: { x: 1, y: 2 } , p2: { x: 3, y: 4 } });
chai.expect(res).to.deep.equal({ x: 4n, y: 6n }); // syntactic sugar for BigInt(""4"") and BigInt(""6"")
```

A couple of feature requests:
1. In #readContract and #writeContract, would be great to be able to paste hex values into the input fields (0xabcd...) as well as decimal values. The cli tooling spits out hex values, so it would make for easier copy/pasting.
2. In #readContract, it would be lovely if struct return values were rendered properly

Not sure if I should be asking here or in the #👷｜hardhat-plugin channel, but can someone give me an overview of the differences between the hardhat-plugin and Nile from OpenZeppelin? 

I currently have a pretty simple starknet smart contract ~working~ locally with Nile and was wondering how this would all work long term as far as managing deployments, migrations, accounts/account contracts, application contracts, etc.

Is there a preferred tool to use? How do I pick the right one?

There is a related config class buried in the cairo-format code path with a `one_per_line` field already. However, it's not publicly exposed to the CLI

It's really great to have you on board. Cairo is not that hard to learn and a promising skill in your toolbox. This tutorial will show you how to write and implement a StarkNet contract: 

https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html 

and https://starknet.io/recorded-tutorials/ 

Henri's new tutorial has just started, it's pretty easy to follow and you can earn some juicy points: https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/853954510515208192/930835511734595595

Cairo was specifically designed to be efficient within STARK, which is the cryptography that Starknet uses to make computations cheap. You can read more about Cairo here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/ and https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/

then come to our discord to the channel community-jobs, write a short summary of your skills and we will hook you up.

I copied the `openzeppelin` directory from the repository root and put it as a sibling to my `contracts` folder. The import paths are resolving nicely (e.g. `openzeppelin.token.erc20.library`).

Unfortunately those files are no longer version controlled. Ideally we wouldn't need to remove the contracts from their parent repository folder, that way I could just *package manage* using git subtrees to inject the entire lib repo into my project folder.

Searching relative to the importing contract is one solution.

What are the technical reasons behind the fact that running tests with `pytest` is so much faster than writing hardhat JS tests pointing to `devnet`? Currently takes around 5 minutes to run a handful of basic tests.

1) through a Docker container with Starknet CLI
2) by specifying a virtual environment with Starknet CLI installed.
The second approach is only slightly faster.
However, the majority of time of a typicial transaction is spent on waiting for Devnet and not in interacting with the environment (be it Docker or venv).","",""
"272122339309649921","naps62","10/03/2022 3:28 pm","I was doing some digging with the devnet. My python skills are almost non-existant, though.

I have a simple Counter contract (keeps track of a single value, and accepts `increment(amount)` txs
with `pytest`, deploying the contract takes ~3 seconds:

```
❯ pytest --capture=no test/contracts/Counter_test.py
.....      
test/contracts/Counter_test.py deploy: 2.99 seconds
```

with starknet-devnet, I instrumented a few sections of the code, to see where time was being spent. This was the output of doing the same thing (just deploying the Counter contract):

```
❯ poetry run starknet-devnet
wrapper: __get_state: 0.0 seconds
wrapper: calculatehash: 0.67 seconds
wrapper: calculate_contract_address: 0.44 seconds
wrapper: get_starknet: 0.0 seconds
wrapper: starknet.deploy: 2.2 seconds
wrapper: self.__update_state: 0.12 seconds
deploy__end: 0.02 seconds
server: add_transaction: 3.58 seconds
server: add_transaction: 0.14 seconds
server: add_transaction: 0.03 seconds
```

the `starknet.deploy` step, which I guess is the equivalent of what pytest is doing, takes 2.2 seconds, which seems in line with pytest. The other stuff around it, particularly `calculatehash` and `calculate_contract_address` accumulate on top of that, by a significant amount

So I guess my questions (again, as a python n00b) would be:
- does the pytest setup skips calculating a txhash and contract address entirely?
- why are these two steps taking so long? I would have imagineded calculating a hash and an address would be pretty quick operations

PS: one thing I noticed during this which contributed to the extra slowness was that I didn't realize pytest fixtures had `scope=module` whereas hardhat was deploying a fresh contract per test. That skewed the difference quite a bit of course","","🛠️ (2),👍 (2)"

- to minimize the codebase therefore the attack/bug surface of the contract
- to avoid having a different function than `__execute__` that handles tx validation (\*) and nonce management. this would not only be duplicated logic (even if it's calling a function) but it also makes a more complex contract, and we need this contract to be super secure
- it's a design statement. if there's other account implementations with other user-facing functions, they should be routed through execute. this makes a much simpler mental model both for wallets and users.

Stark budliers have to build data indexing services when data indexing services don't come to StarkNet. 

Checkpoint is a library to index StarkNet events and make them accessible through a GraphQL API. Checkpoint is heavily inspired by The Graph and aims to provide the same solution on StarkNet.

Coming from a web 2.0 back-end software engineering background, I don't like the idea to test private, internal in case of Cairo, methods as these are, for me, implementation details and should be tested via public, here external, methods.
For me, unit testing should be focused on testing the outputs/inputs of a contract. Testing the actual implementation defeats this purpose as the tests know about the implementation and not the interface. If you test all your external methods with the right inputs and have full coverage, then you shouldn't need to test the internal ones imo. 
Maybe this way of thinking is not really transferrable to smart contracts and the way they are written. If anyone has a different take on this, I'd be happy to hear it ! 🙂","","👍 (2)"

+ tracking down a bug in a unit test is *a lot* easier than trying to figure out why the output of a smart contract call is not correct
And also I think that in smart contract development we should test as many things as possible, as long as it makes sense to test it. I read somewhere that a 30-35% dev - 65-70% test ratio was good and I tend to agree.","","👍 (3),👆 (1),👌 (1)"

Therefore, we would love to get an impression on your current test management approach. Where do you currently see the pain points for smart contract testing (especially for integration and system tests) on StarkNet? 

We would be very thankful if you could fill in our short questionnaire, but of course also for any kind of feedback! 🙏

A first release candidate for nile-rs is out.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile-rs/releases

The CLI is designed for easily interacting with either a devnet node or public networks, and also comes with a scripting system with a RuntimeEnvironment similar to what we had in python.

Check the Feature Parity and a Quick Start walkthrough for examples in the README.md, with examples on how to easily declare and deploy Cairo 1 contracts.
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile-rs/tree/v0.1.0-rc.1#feature-parity

The base project comes with an example script, run nile-rs run example in the project directory (after `init`) with a devnet node running to test it. The first time takes some time to build the scripting crate, but after that it should be fairly fast.

As always, issues and/or PRs are more than welcome.","","🔥 (5),StarkNet (2)"

Wanted to share a developer preview of our open source indexing stack: https://github.com/dipdup-io/starknet-indexer

-> It provides everything you might expect from an indexer and some additional cool features, e.g. pre-decoded event payloads / tx calldata
-> We use it as a middleware to power our TheGraph-like indexing framework (in Python 🐍, coming soon)
-> It can be used to build an archive node for L3 chains (we have also indexing modules for EVM)
-> But it's also just a generic GraphQL API to access a wide range of data, starting with raw chain data, ending with NFT metadata and aggregated market data (coming in the next versions)

There are public deployments for Mainnet and Goerli2 and a GraphQL playground with docs — check out the repo & wiki for more details.  
Would love any feedback and collaboration proposals, pls let me know if you have any questions/suggestions🙏🏻","","happy (1),pepeclap (2)"

I want to deploy the Cairo 1 voting contract (outlined in Cairo book: https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch99-01-04-01-voting-contract.html) on testnet.
The book has outlined the process to use local development using katana. 
However, I am interested to deploy the contract on testnet and interact with contract on testnet.
I tried to look around, but could not find example/material to deploy cairo 1 contract on testnet. 

I will be thankful to pointers/examples to deploy Cairo 1 contract on testnet. 🙏","","✅ (66)"
