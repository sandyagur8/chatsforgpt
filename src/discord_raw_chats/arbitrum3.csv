With AA, the way for a UserOp to pay for L1 fees is not through gasLimit, but through preVerificationGas.
preVerificationGas is a value the userOp will pay anyway if the transaction gets included - it is not a ""limit"". It is built specifically for paying things that can't be calculated on-chain.
On L1 networks, the calculations is roughly:
 overhead + sum([(4 if b==0 else 16) for b in callData)])
This ""overhead"" includes the 21000 stipend, handleOps over head and divided by bundle size)

On L2 like arbitrum, the calculation is:
(overhead + sum(16*brotli(callData).length))*l1GasPrice/l2GasPrice

From airdrop distribution sheets we can clearly see that Arbitrum team doesn't have any intentions to prevent sybil attacks (farmers with 500+ bots easily get 500k+ tokens from airdrop). Even tho all this farms are easily detectable, nothing was done by team to do it.

 There's a lot of people here who got hacked, and now the hackers are going to get the tokens and instadump them instead of the tokens being distributed to actual community members. Plus many projects already have a known way to deal with this by either delegating tokens of the hacked address to a new one, or batch claiming them, or some other technical solution.

I'm trying to understand how the sequencer transaction process takes place.
This scheme right here is part of the sequencing followed by a deterministic execution.

In the part circled in red, is this process only done when there is a proof and when an active validator is operating?

or is it the standard process after sequencing done by the sequencer?

Another question, doesn't this batch and compress process involve sequencing transactions? Because the sequencing image is later in the schematic of arrows that the soft process guarantees and batch and compress","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045177702170247248/1086258691319279617/image.png",""

Then, validator nodes obtain the sequenced transactions, executes them (state transition function) and post assertions of the state of the chain into L1.

So, to answer your questions:
- that circle in red is done by the validator nodes, who will post assertions of the state into L1 (that little ""settle to L1 arrow"" at the bottom)
- After sequencing, publishing in its feed, batching and posting, the Sequencer has finished its job.
- Yes, the sequencing is done before batch and compress.

If you got multiple points but have a lot less tokens then you think, you should‚Äôve gotten that‚Äôs probably because your wallet was considered a Sybil.

A lot of your eligible members are facing the same problem. I believe that it's not too late to consider the interest of your participants. We'll be losing a huge financial step upward and it's not fair, I've contacted a few moderators and they've made it clear that they have zero provisions for us, I understand, tbh I do. But it doesn't make it fair anyways.
I think if it's our drop nonetheless, you can easily provide an alternative where we can claim with a different wallet, I know this will cause extra work for the developers and even more money, this I believe the victims can bear the cost.
You have already made mention that those who qualify but were not eligible should Dm with proof, the same process can follow for us too. 
I have proof that I own the wallet and that it qualifies, and even more proof of the presence of the scavenger bot
I know this method can be easily taken advantage of, however, you'll be helping a huge amount of people. 
You can also limit members applying for this special case by discussing with the team and agreeing on the best proofs that will prove ownership and the presence of a scavenger or sweeper bot on the wallet. Then you can easily redirect our airdrop to a new provided wallet.I know you guys never planned for this to have happened, and it's beyond your control but the amount of scams out here is insane and it's been a really long time since we started interacting with Arbitrum, hence you guys ought to be concerned","",""

on the left side we have the simplified process that occurs when we have two validators betting, one that block 93 is the next correct one and another betting that 95 is the next correct one to 92 (in the text it was stated that both are validators, but here's mine question, is Alice really going to be a validator or a sequencer?) Isn't creating RBlocks only done by validators?
If you can explain this process better to me, it would help me a lot, I don't understand so well yet.
Alice who created Rblock 93?
The sequencer also has its capital staked, right? So where does he stand in this process to ensure his honesty?

You have to deploy on both networks and have a trusted party (yourself) do the bridge. Smart contracts (decentralized) will store the tokens. But you (trusted party) will initiate the outward transfer off the bridge. A decentralized party can be created by deploying another blockchain (bridge chain) that can access both arbitrum and ethereum (or whatever) and the outward transfer can be initiated only if tokens have been locked by the smart contract on the other side of the bridge. Maybe this is what multirouter uses not sure. Anyone has any idea?","",""

First problem to find a good validation/consensus mechanism so that validator of the bridge chain doesn't go rogue. One way would be verification by a group of verification nodes which happen as part of the block production. But would require the block producer to stake a balance greater than total amount validated in that block.
Second problem is if all verification nodes are also paid, the transaction fees for the bridge may become too high.
Third problem is to handle inconsistencies inside one of the networks. If one of the networks (eth, arbitrum, etc) is attacked or compromised, it should be cut off from the bridge chain and to do that, bridge chain would be essentially verifying those networks also.

Seems too much work for the nodes.","",""

All transactions on Arbitrum go first through a Sequencer, that orders them (FIFO) prior to being executed.
In the last stage of the transaction cycle, these ordered transactions are also run by validators (through a State Transition Function) who will submit assertions of the state root of the chain to L1. Those assertions can be challenged by other validator nodes, through a process called ""Fraud Proof""

I know there‚Äôs a lot of contentious debate on twitter lately as to what specifically defines a rollup, so forgive me if I am misstating certain properties, and please correct me where my intuition goes wrong

I want to focus on ‚Äúclassic‚Äù smart contract rollups that settle to Ethereum, a la Arbitrum and Optimism

From a high level this Arbitrum contract on L1 seems to perform 4 major functions: 
1)    Warehouses L2 TXs
2)    Archives L2 state roots
3)    Operates a bidirectional bridge that allows ETH L1 native assets to move in/out of the L2 environment
4)    Serves as the arbitration agent for fraud disputes

The major question I have is around the last component. From what I understand, ETH mainnet has no formal understanding or awareness of the L2 TXs (posted as calldata on L1)- it‚Äôs essentially pure gibberish of bytes. 

But we also have this notion of fraud disputes where Party 1 claims the state root of the recent rollup batch is X, and Party 2 claims the state root of the rollup batch is Y. And we are relying on the L1 to make the correct judgment call on what the valid, canonical state root is (the whole concept of the base chain underwriting security of the rollup). But we just mentioned earlier that the L1 has no semblance of any of these L2 TXs sitting in calldata‚Ä¶from the perspective of the L1, it doesn‚Äôt even know the rollup exists. So how does the L1 become ‚Äúaware‚Äù to thereby processes these L2 TXs and derive the ‚Äúvalid‚Äù state output?","",""
"755423697027727471","msv_mahsa#6693","09/06/2023 9:40 pm","Hey! in Arbitrum, individuals and contracts submit messages into the inbox (L1). The chain reads and processes these messages sequentially, resulting in updates to the chain's state and generating outputs. To have a transaction processed by an Arbitrum chain, you must put the transaction into the chain's inbox. Subsequently, the chain will detect and execute your transaction, generating outputs in the form of a transaction receipt.

This approach ensures that the L1 inbox maintains a comprehensive record of the chain's entire history. As a result, anyone can recreate the most recent state of the chain by executing its transactions in the precise order in which they were recorded.","",""

-The L2 doesn't warehouse them (ie the L2 isnt the DA layer), but is able to look at the TXs on the L1 and derive meaning from the content embedded, execute them against the L2 state, and compute a new L2 state root

During a fraud dispute however, and from what I understand (correct me if I am wrong) the L2 falls back on the L1 smart contract to re-execute the state transition functions (or in event of a interactive fraud dispute, a micro segment of the STFs). This implies that somewhere along the road, the L1 becomes ""conscious"" of the L2 TXs it is storing as calldata, and is able to re-execute those transactions to determine the correct L2 state.

My question is- where and how does this L1 ""consciousness"" occur in the protocol?","",""

And all the L1 does is to execute the chain from that point using the inbox contents. What sits on the inbox in plain word is (1) the inputs for each tx and (2) the intrsuctions to execute them.

"818557824878641212","macro_student","10/06/2023 7:52 pm","ok. So if i understand now:

- Sequencers update the state root of the rollup contract on the L1, and after the delay period elapses, a ""confirmed"" state is derived. Thus, the L1 is aware of the most recent canonical state of the rollup
- The L1 receives and warehouses L2 TXs, and its not that the L1 *can't* understand these TXs, but rather it chooses to passively ignore them (unless called upon to interpret)
- When a fraud dispute arises, this is when the L1 will flip into ""consiousness"" mode and actually extract and decipher the L2 TXs
- To mitigate the amount of cost/execution in the above step, we try and narrow the interactive fraud proof down as succinctly as possible, ie where the disagreement in STF occurs between the parties, so the L1 doesnt have to re-execute the whole batch

you can connect to the Sequencer's feed directly to read the data published by the Sequencer. In the short term, however, that feed will be compressed with a custom dictionary, so you'll have to run a feed relay => https://developer.arbitrum.io/node-running/how-tos/running-a-feed-relay

1. If a sequencer is honest, it batches transactions to an L1 smart contract inbox. Users can alternatively post messages to L1 smart contract directly.
2. Validators run the messages using Arbitrum VM and publish the state -- or some variation of the state -- of Arbitrum (called RBlocks) to the L1 smart contracts. 
3. If a transaction is invalid (e.g. user attempts to withdraw tokens they don't have), VM will reject the transaction. A validator (probably pseudo-randomly?) is chosen to propose an an RBlock. If it is invalid an honest validator is incentivized to challenge it to get part of the dishonest validator's staked ETH.
4. If a sequencer is dishonest, the worst it can do is reject or reshuffle transactions. Out of curiosity, if the current sequencer node gets hacked, what would be the course of action? I am guessing the DNS will be rerouted to a different server?
5. It is more scalable and has less gas fees than L1 because of compression and transaction batching.
6. Out of curiosity, has a similar solution been attempted for L1? Heavy contract calls get run off-chain and then the results of the calls get passed to L1 and a challenge period is also applied. This would directly improve the scalability of L1. I guess the concurrency edge cases are difficult to handle in this case?","",""

"1130587260388118719","nice_protein_bar#6635","17/08/2023 8:39 pm","Thanks a lot, that's really helpful! A few follow up questions:

1. I read on the docs that moving the sequencer to a set of nodes is in progress and being researched but am curious why can't a pre-existing consensus solution work here?
2. Come to think of it, what are the downsides to NOT using L1 to directly publish to the inbox. If there were no sequencer and users directly submitted to the L1, there would be consensus on the ordering. I guess the answer is gas fees but shouldn't **gas fees**[20 separate compressed transaction] ~= **gas fees**[1 compressed batch of 20 transactions]? Could you explain why not please. Docs also say because the nodes have to wait for a number of ethereum block confirmations which makes sense. 
3. In practice, how often does it happen that a RBlock is challenged? I imagine very rarely due to the incentives. 
4. For the L1 chain idea what I was thinking was:

- Let's say Uniswap v3 computations want to be done off-chain to save gas. 
- Users post transactions to some smart contract similar to what's done in Arbitrum.
- Then off-chain nodes run the Uniswap v3 code and produce the results via optimistic rollups.
- They post the results (balance changes) to the smart contract and, hence, avoid the need for all ethereum nodes to run the heavy computations. Instead, ethereum nodes only update the state of the chain.
- This way a separate chain won't be necessary. (Obviously a separate chain has its advantages but am curious if something similar directly for L1 exists). However, I suppose the concurrency edge cases are difficult/impossible to handle?","",""
"442478266616512513","hkalodner","17/08/2023 10:45 pm","1. A couple reasons here: A) Leader based consensus systems are possible, but would allow for the leader at any given block to maliciously extract MEV vs more sophisticated systems, B) Latency is very important for L2 UX so many consensus algorithms would degrate the user experience by being too slow
2. This is possible and was the original design of Arbitrum actually before a sequencer was introduced. A similar idea is described here more recently https://ethresear.ch/t/based-rollups-superpowers-from-l1-sequencing/15016. This sort of design is totally possible, but A) The latency would be much worse and B) There are fixed costs associated with batch posting which is why a single batch of 20 transactions is significantly cheaper C) Compression is also much more effective when there's more data being compressed
3. On arbitrum one and arbitrum nova this has never happened. Currently validation is permissioned with a bunch of different parties whitelisted, but nobody who's been actively malicious or buggy. Offchain Labs has been developing BOLD (https://medium.com/offchainlabs/bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum-chains-9934eb5328cc) as a way to drop that perimissioning. Challenges have occured though both on testnet for testing as well as on the arbitrum one fork on EthPOW
4. You can totally have an application specific rollup like you described. I'd say the main argument against would be I don't think you gain that much vs using a general purpose rollup chain since you need basically all the same components","",""

Seeing from Uniswap Labs research (can't share links in this server) that the TWAP is updated block-by-block, that it cannot be manipulated therefore by just a single atomic swap in/out.
