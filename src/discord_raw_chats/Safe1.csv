"502894289114628106","swnt","20/04/2023 1:57 am","I hope this is the correct channel to ask. Regarding the massive distributed hacks and wallet drains happening currently (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12s45c5/an_update_on_the_crypto_hack_currently_taking/). **Does anybody know, if Safe Smart Contract multi-sig wallets also have been drained?** I've only limited amounts of money there, so I've not been pwned currently. Or perhaps the hackers haven't implemented that.

On that regard, would it be possible to actually implement a variation of Gnosis Safes, where the owners are NOT publicly visible? (https://etherscan.io/address/0xE0a88c4E543a0e0d15d697403849A75Da40962B4#readProxyContract). Such a feature could provide interesting privacy guarantees and at the same time it could also shield the above attack, because the attacker would need to know which owners are used and cannot simply look them up on chain. Obviously this has drawbacks in case one forgets some of the owners, but nevertheless, it's interesting.","",""
"666138778368212993","bing2","20/04/2023 2:13 am","No. Also, Safes are smart contract wallets, unlike those described in the article. Depending on the policy you set, having one owner wallet compromised will not immediately give access to the scammer/hacker.","",""
"502894289114628106","swnt","20/04/2023 2:19 am","Indeed. Enough signers need to be compromised to hack the gnosis safe. I am asking whether perhaps the hacker didn't brother implementing this for gnosis safes, since going for EOAs was already lucrative.

It's funny that months ago I decided for a gnosis safe instead of a hardware wallet - because I didn't like the *existence* of a single point of failure - the seed phrase. Maybe that's what has protected me until now with this current hack ^^'","","🙌 (2)"
