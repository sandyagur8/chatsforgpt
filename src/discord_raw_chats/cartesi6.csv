"466343326023680000","edubart","14/09/2023 4:07 pm","I gave both Next.js and Vue a try. I could achieve more in less time in the frontend with Vue, what I felt:
- Next.js/React I had to learn how to use their own HTML components like `Link` instead of `a`, and I do not feel coding HTML code,  I had to re-learn some basic HTML components again, this slowed me, while in Vue I can still use raw HTML5 code
- Next.js is meant to also have server side code, I had to use `typeof window !== ""undefined""` is places to trigger client side code only, this felt hacky, my frontend is single page only, while Vue is meant for single page apps only, no server side stuff
- Next.js I must use TypeScript, there were places I need to use external JS libraries with untyped code, I spent valuable hours trying to please the type checker, eventually I gave up and I had to end up using `// @ts-ignore:next-line` everywhere, whereas in Vue without typescript I could go faster

Overall I feel that TypeScript is valuable for large complex dapps when working with large teams, due type checking and safety. But for quickly hacking a prototype seems like to slow me down, might work better for people with experience on it. TypeScript+React+Next.js feels like you need to relearn both HTML and JS, while Vue+JS feels like bare old HTML5 and JS, requiring less to learn and faster to prototype. I only did web dev in a time before TS existed, so this is my biased opinion.","",""

"517899425369030696","dtuler","14/09/2023 5:19 pm","- you can use plain html with next.js. `Link` does other goodies like pre-fetching.
- just add `""use client;""` in the top of the file and the component will render on the client. By default it renders on the server for performance reasons

the JS APIs I made on top of Emscripten WASM APIs 😆 , I was doing stuff like JS <-> WASM calls, such as:
```js
        // @ts-ignore:next-line
        let buf = Module._malloc(cartridge_data.length);
        // @ts-ignore:next-line
        Module.HEAPU8.set(cartridge_data, buf);
        // @ts-ignore:next-line
        Module.ccall('rivemu_start', null, [ 'number', 'number' ], [ buf, cartridge_data.length ]);
        // @ts-ignore:next-line
        Module._free(buf);

`ts-ignore:next-line` everywhere 🙂","",""

The frontend using some framework stack like (vite + wagmi + wagmi-cli + react + bootstrap v5 + rainbowkit) and a reference backend using any language (not that important, the developer could swap the backend to his language of choice), this would save me a lot of time and effort","","👍 (1)"

"517899425369030696","dtuler","18/09/2023 9:39 pm","I agree that writing a good web3 frontend is quite a task. And most of the job is not related to Cartesi at all. Wallets interaction and GraphQL interaction are the bulk of it, and tools like wagmi (1) and graphql-codegen (2) help a lot. There is a lot of asynchronicity, even more with Cartesi, where inputs are transactions that can take a long time, and then there is machine execution that adds to that. It's hard IMO to provide a good template because I feel the frontend depends a lot on the application.
