The channel you're in right now is about the descartes-rollups, which would - by this table's definition - be a true L2 solution. 

The Cartesi rollups would be similar to the Optimistic Rollups section, everything is secured by L1 and there is a finalization period for things to be withdrawable onchain. Our rollups, like the optimistic one, use fraud proofs instead of validity proofs.

We do have very different design decisions from Optimistic  - they use the OVM, limiting them to running things that can only be ran on the EVM. Further, their fraud proof is not interactive, limiting the intensity of computations to what can be proved on L1. The Cartesi RollUps uses a RISC-V VM that is capable of running linux, so it dramatically increases the kinds of things you can do and we use an interactive fraud proof - which doesnt impose a limit on the size of computation we can withstand (i.e creepts).

Having said that, we also have a Sidechain called Noether...which was designed to deal exactly with the problem highlighted on that table - the ""data hungryness"" of Rollups. I still haven't read the article, so I'll do that before criticizing it too much - it does seem, however, that it underestimates the importance and tradeoff possibilities of sidechains.","",""

- The game is based on Mental Poker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker), meaning that players can use cryptography to play against each other without a central server
- The game runs mostly in the browser, and whenever a player makes a move (e.g., places a bet), that information is registered/logged in the blockchain
- The core Mental Poker library is written in C++, and is compiled to WebAssembly for use within the browser (along with front-end logic written in Typescript)
- If anyone tries to cheat or if the players disagree (e.g., both players claim to have won), any player can ""appeal to the supreme court"", which amounts to calling the smart contracts on the blockchain to enforce the correct result. At this point, the game log stored in the blockchain can be used to trigger a Descartes computation. This will run the very same C++ code inside a Cartesi VM to execute the entire game and find out who actually won.","","👍 (3)"

You can stake directly by running your own node and the tutorial is here: https://medium.com/cartesi/running-a-node-and-staking-42523863970e

So the more you stake or the lower the globally staked CTSI is, your chances get higher and you are more likely to produce fast, while the opposite makes it more likely to take longer to produce. 

For current APY, please check: https://explorer.cartesi.io/

You can take a look at the calculator at the Cartesi Explorer ( https://explorer.cartesi.io/calculator ) to simulate some scenarios on a simplified model of the PoS and have a grasp on what to expect (the calculator outputs AVERAGES for nodes in the given condition, since, as I explained, the system is probabilistic). 

The other option available right now is staking through a 3rd party custodian service. They work like centralized pools and have their own set of rules and policies for rewards and conditions on staking. You can check CoinOne and MyContainer as options in that model. 
I strongly suggest you read this FAQ about considerations between staking by yourself or through a 3rd party custodian service: https://github.com/cartesi/noether/wiki/FAQ#is-it-better-to-run-my-own-node-or-to-use-a-3rd-party-custodial-service-to-stake

`app.logger.info(""Adding notice"") response = requests.post(dispatcher_url + ""/notice"", json={""payload"": body[""payload""]})`

Since I've done many other inputs, i believe the new notices aren't being added properly. Moreover, i've acessed the new inputs with

`query{ current_epoch{inputs{ inputs{ } } } }`

I don't know if it is clear, i believe i've executed the query right.

I've followed the example from site (https://cartesi.io/en/docs/machine/target/linux/) for doing an hello.cpp, and it went smooth. But i have some questions when generalizing it.

For instance, if instead of using an cpp file, what if i used directly an python file like hello.py? I would have to generate an ext2 file with 

`genext2fs -b 1024 -d hellopy hellopy.ext2 (Content of hellopy directory is the hello.py file)`
and then use the following

`cartesi-machine \`
    `--flash-drive=label:hellopy,filename:hellopy.ext2 \`
   `-- /mnt/hellopy/hello.py`

Those are the right steps for it? When i did it, i've got an

`/bin/sh: /mnt/hellopy/hello.py: Permission denied`. 

I even try instead of using the ""hello.py"" using an .sh script to call hello.py but the result were the same.

Hi guys, I have some questions and really hope that you can explain that to me.

As I read one of the post in medium, system will interact with backend through API ( link : https://medium.com/cartesi/cartesi-dapps-are-here-e07f358207d6). However, in some examples such as ""hello world"", ""calculator"" in the Docs of Cartesi, backend run all script data on file where we set up cartesi machine, not through API. 

So my question is , how does the cartesi machine interact with backend in the production enviroment, ? 

The pic attached below demonstrates how the components interact with each other in ""hello world"" and ""echo"" examples ( the flow of system). Did I have any misunderstandings?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813381014104571904/941240929128415282/Cartesi_draft.drawio.png",""

We have 2 products: Descartes v1 (our first product) and Cartesi Rollups (the new one).

The examples you mentioned are related to the Descartes v1 that is very different from Cartesi Rollups. 😉 

These 2 products have one thing in common: both have a Cartesi Machine as their heart.

So here comes a simplified diagram that shows how your input when running the rollups-examples/echo reach your backend code.

Let me know any other question you have, ok?","","👍 (1)"

this project is awesome.

I had no problem running the tutorial at https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/tree/main/echo, but I have some issues.

1 - When I run docker-compose-host, all containers run in host mode. Then, I start the echo server gunicorn in vsCode. I send the first interaction ""...echo:addInput.."", and I get the operation's confirmation ""Added input.."". That's all right. But when I stop the gunicorn, and send the same ""...echo:addInput.."", I receive the same confirmation ""Added input.."", but no input was added to the echo, I supose. No containers from the other docker-compose was running, nor the echo gunicorn. I was not sure if gunicorn were running somewere, so I changed the name of ""echo.py"" to be sure no file was listening in 0.0.0.0:5003 since gunicorn looks for that file. This is the default ""Added input.."" confirmation's behavior or I'm missing something?

2 - I have started developing a django(python) app to listen on port 5003. Now it only listens. When I do ""...echo:addInput.."", django just receives the request. When I do it again, django doesn't receive anymore. Then, I restart the containers and I do the ""...echo:addInput.."" again as the first time, without restarting django. It receives. Only the first time. The containers stop communicating with the Dapp when the Dapp doesn't respond the first time? (Anyway, the ""Added input.."" message still occurs.)

A friend told me to check all process listening on 5003. I used ""sudo lsof -i :5003"" and ""ss"" similar commands, but only the django app was listening, and doesn't send any response yet. When I stop django server, no process is listening on 5003.","","👍 (1)"

Do you guys ever seen this happen? Maybe this message appeared because i've used an local rootfs and theres some sync process with the default archive or did i forgot something in the configuration of buildroot? The machine seems to work well even with this warning message but i want to know what is really happening here. If you guys have some clues, i would be glad to know.

*Considering all requiriments for running Buildroot installed.

1 - Download in https://buildroot.org/download.html
2 - Unpack the tar.gz file

### Including py_expression_eval in the build root options###

3 - in the /package folder created a folder called py-exp-eval. inside it included 3 files: Config.in, py-exp-eval.hash and py-exp-eval.mk

Contents of Config.in :

config BR2_PACKAGE_PY_EXP_EVAL
    bool ""py_expression_eval""

After this, we can use the package inside build root.

4 - Inside buildroot folder, opened the terminal and executed make xconfig.
Target architeture : RISCV
Target Binary Format: ELF
Target Architecture Variant: General purpose
Target Architecture Size: 64-bit
Target ABI: lp64d


Interpreter languages and scripting: 
python3
.py sources and pyc compiled

External python modules:
Flask
py_expression_eval

FileSystem images
ext2/3/4 root filesystem > ext2 (rev1), no compression.

5 - After save configuration, i've run the command make and it generated an rootfs.ext2 with almost the same size of the default rootfs we get in the default run of echo example.

6 - replaced the rootfs inside the server folder. Excluded the rootfs from the dependecies file, which now has this content
https://github.com/cartesi/image-kernel/releases/download/v0.9.0/linux-5.5.19-ctsi-3.bin
https://github.com/cartesi/machine-emulator-rom/releases/download/v0.8.0/rom.bin

7 - run the make machine command. The machine is built normally, but with the warning showed above.

8 - The program also works fine. No problems found yet.

Hello @Albert Nguyen !
The SQLite is already installed in our default rootfs (version 0.9.0).

To check that, please run the following commands:
1. Run Cartesi machine in interactive mode:
make console 

2. Inside the cartesi machine, run:
find . -type f -name ""*sql*""

3. It expected to have the following result:
./usr/bin/sqlite3
./usr/lib/libsqlite3.so.0.8.6
./usr/lib/lua/5.3/lsqlite3.so

Hi @Albert Nguyen !
If you created your SQLite project from our Simple Echo example, you must take a look at your build-dapp-fs.sh file (https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/blob/main/echo/server/build-dapp-fs.sh).

There you will find the following:
``genext2fs -f -i 512 -b 16 -d $DAPP_FS $DAPP_FS_BIN``

The ``-b 16`` option is creating a 16 Bytes drive. Which is off course not enough space for a DApp with a database. 🙂 

Try a more appropriate value for your DApp, for example: ``-b 1024``

Please let us know about any other problem!","",""

Hi @Albert Nguyen !

First of all, I checked the `Shapely` repo and I noticed that it depends on a C++ library called `GEOS`. When you install `Shapely` locally you are using a x86 binary for `GEOS` but you need a RISC-V binary to run inside the Cartesi machine. That said, just copying `Shapely` installation for the Cartesi machine drive will not work.

If you really want to use `Shapely` you will need to cross-complie `GEOS` for the Cartesi machine. Another solution is to find a another pure Python library that does the same. Ok?","",""

Cartesi Rollups is not tied up to Python. You can develop your DApps using:

@Aleksander , you can develop your React frontend and have a Python/C++/Javascript backend.

After the launch of Cartesi Rollups 0.2 you don't need a http server (provided by NodeJS for example) to run you Javascript backend code anymore. It became simpler to run JavaScript code in the backend.

Take a look at QuickJS (https://bellard.org/quickjs/) which is the JavaScript runtime environment that is provided inside the Cartesi Machine.

This script runs the HTTP API, waits until it is ready, and only then runs your application.

I am developing an DApp using the Cartesi Rollups and it everything was working fine until I decided to make an update to Cartesi Rollups version 0.2.
The problem is that after the update the back-end receives an empty payload, even though I am sending data. I managed to talk with a Cartesi member in private (Thanks for your time Carlo!), and as suggested, I am now using the localhost.json file that is generated when the Hardhat container is started, this should prevent any problem related to address and ABI of the contracts. But, even after this change the error persists.

So, I decided to do an test, I made an simple program that uses the Web3.js to send an input to the Cartesi Rollups and because I was afraid that the problem could be my application I tested it with the echo example too. The result was that I got the same error/behaviour in both applications. While running this test I could observe some things:","",""

Hello @wch-karol-p | webchefs !
The root file-system (rootfs) contains all data files and programs that make up an embedded Linux distro. We focus on keep it as light weight as possible.

Specific needs about other programs can be solved by creating a custom rootfs or an extra file-system for your DApp's needs. We used the second option on our examples. Taking the Simple Echo example as reference, you can check its script for creating a file system for this DApp: https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/blob/main/echo/server/build-dapp-fs.sh

Creating a custom rootfs or a DApp file system, you will need to cross-compile `curl` for the RISC-V architecture to run inside the Cartesi Machine.

I am during my onboarding period and have some questions regarding this https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kxNqqHTCkRgv8ouRxWp-e8Bxih8gOHqpKcXdSasK5EQ/edit# instructions:

1. Simple Echo Rollups Example / a. / ii.  - I was wondering about correct localhost/notice call to test shape (data, headers, etc). I did something like you can see in *1 attachment*. I could confirm from console feedback that the endpoint gets some request. *Was there something else I should do at this point?* (mostly wondering about mimicking adding input or whatever was placed in echo example instructions)

2. As much as instructions before were pretty clear for me to follow I got lost on Cartesi Machine's checkpoint. For now I just search for keywords from docs like 'site: www.cartesi.io interactive mode' through Google. I am following this https://cartesi.io/en/docs/machine/host/overview/ for this 2nd point. Though this makes it a lot more confusing as I do guess-working. From instruction point I was wondering if I should get my own Linux OS on some VM software or do it some other way (since running preperation script on anything other than Linux shouldn't work if I understand Cartesi Machine correctly). So question here is: *is what I am following from the link above is what doc author had in mind? *

Also general question for checkpoints 3,4,5 - *should I follow the same logic as in point 2. to get through this checklist?*

1) So the test should be performed in host mode (that is, the ""backend"" code is not running inside the Cartesi Machine, but locally on your host. When you do that, you'll have the application service exposed to your host and you can use insomnia, postman or any other HTTP client to test it directly. About the shape of the request, the rollups framework puts some headers that are useful for the application since it doesn't have access to the external world when running inside the Cartesi Machine, you can inspect those by making a call to add an input through the blockchain. When running locally with hardhat as the blockchain, you can use one the helper scripts included in echo like described on the README-https://github.com/cartesi-corp/rollups-examples/tree/feature/chess/echo#interacting-with-the-application: ```$ npx hardhat --network localhost echo:addInput --input ""0x63617274657369""```","",""

"615539144638070784","carlofragni","28/05/2022 12:10 am","About the payload, the rollups framework treats all data as ""binary"" and the only requirement is that it's hex encoded, which is the common format used in Ethereum transactions. Once again you can take a look at the Echo example on how to decode/encode data from that format. Inside this ""binary"" payload you can set your own conventions about what the data represents: you can encode your data in JSON or whatever custom format you'd like that makes sense for your application. The calculator example, for instance, uses JSON, so you might want to take a look at it.","",""

Those tasks are meant for you to get acquainted with the Cartesi Machine. You don't have to install Linux on your computer, create a VM or anything, but you do need Docker. The Cartesi Machine is a VM itself and runs Linux inside of it. Following our documentation, the way you'll run the Cartesi Machine in interactive mode is inside a Docker container, so that you don't need to worry about installing the correct environment with all the dependencies and getting the compilation of the Cartesi Machine right.","",""
"615539144638070784","carlofragni","28/05/2022 12:19 am","When your DApp code runs inside the Cartesi Machine it's pretty much isolated, a bit like when you run code inside an embedded device, so it's hard to figure out what's going on, if you are missing a file needed for your program to run correctly, you are missing some dependency or something else.

Also as the Cartesi Machine is the runtime environment for the trusted computing part of your DApp, the onboarding process has a lot of focus on getting familiar with it and how to port things to it (cross-compiling code, porting dependencies, etc) and also on how to figure out what's going on inside of it and debugging your code.","",""

Now it's just a client: when you call /finish it does 2 things: accepts/rejects the last processed input and yields until a new request was made to your DApp, returning in the response the new input/inspect details for your DApp to process.","",""

- Enable certain DApp features according the volume of assets the user have deposited into the Portal. Imagine a game where certain doors only open if you have certain amount of assets or a voting DApp that considers the volume deposited by users to give weigh for their vote;
- and much more... 😍 

The dev's creativity will be the limit.

I've got another thing to ask if you don't mind. Considering that i already have a custom rootfs.ext2, what are the procedures to change the main rootfs.ext2 for my version of it?

I was trying to go to the docker folder, removing the rootfs.ext2 file from dependencies and put my file there (in the older versions i was doing something like that), but it seems it don't download the file in that folder (in this case my file being already there it wasn't necessary to be downloaded, so that is why I've removed from the dependencies file).

In the building process, it fails like the image below (i removed it from the dependencies file so the build-machine.sh script fails). If i don't change it, it will build the machine but probably my dapp won't work considering the default rootfs doesn't have all my dependencies. What can i do in this scenario?

To access the input contract you should refer to the InputFacet abi, but you should use the main Diamond contract address. In this rollups examples version, when the rollups contracts are deployed in the local hardhat, the contracts' abis are copied to deployments/localhost/ and the main contract address is copied to deployments/localhost/dapp.address.
As an example, to access the input contract deployed in the local hardhat in python you could do:

```
import json
from web3 import Web3

web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(""http://localhost:8545""))

adress_file = open(""deployments/localhost/dapp.address"",'r')
rollups_address = adress_file.read()
    
input_abi_file = open(""deployments/localhost/InputFacet.json"",'r')
input_abi_json = json.load(input_abi_file)

2 - The input processing incurred into some error, so, once again no notice 
3 - There is a know issue with hardhat network getting stuck and only returning to process things as expected with a new transaction being issued

To determine which one is the case, you should look at the server manager logs and see it the inputs were processed or not. If they were and there are notices being produced, you'll see on the query indexer logs when it collects those and writes to the database. If you don't see activity on the server manager logs, might be the issue described on (3).

Currently, to work with the inspect_state you need to expose the 5002 port in docker-compose-host.yml.
Then, you can send HTTP requests to http://localhosts:5002/inspect/<hex payload> to use it.
As the inspect_state was initially developed to be used as a debug tool, it is only available in host mode. The inspect_state in production mode will soon be available.","","👍 (2)"

I'm having a separate Rust folder and a dapp folder(see the attached files) that contains all the building config and scripts for building machine.

In v0.6.0 version, I can first cross-build the Rust binary in my Rust folder, and then copy the binary to the dapp folder to build up the machine.

I tried the same way in v0.7.1, and running the dapp in host mode, the dapp can receive the input and write the new notice normally, but the strange thing is that I can't query out the written notice from graphQL.

Besides, I've seen the error logs below:

```

1. When we call `http://localhosts:5002/inspect/<hex payload>`, does that means we are directly interacting with the dapp or the Cartesi node?
2. Does the hex payload finally handled by `handle_inspect` function in dapp?
3. Is there any structure limit for the hex payload?","",""
"884645630130135055","Albert Nguyen#4219","11/08/2022 11:03 am","2. That's right.
3. I faced one issue with inspect is that if the hex payload is too long, the URL will be automatically cut.

Another thing when you call inspect api, is that the body passed to your code will be like this:
`{'request_type': 'inspect_state', 'data': {'payload': '0x7b20226d65746164617461223a207b20226d73675f73656e646572223a2022'}}`

Above structure is a litte bit different when you call by command line, and it will throw a Key error when you tried to get `metadata` from rollup_request (this line in while function will throw the error: `metadata = rollup_request[""data""][""metadata""]`). So, you need to change the code in `while function` a little (I assume you use the example code from rollups-example).","","👍 (2)"

The key difference is when the DApp rejects an input, the notices and vouchers are discarded and the state of the Cartesi Machine is rolled back to the previous state. 

On the the other hand, reports are not discarded and you can query them in the graphql server. Querying reports is very similar as querying notices. 
From the frontend-console you can query them with:
```
yarn start report list
yarn start report list --epoch 0 --input 1

The vouchers payload include the 4-byte function signature at the beginning of the byte string. So, to decode the erc20 voucher you should drop the first 4 bytes and decode with [""address"", ""uint256""]. An example:
```
import { ethers } from ""ethers"";

payload = ethers.utils.hexDataSlice(payload,4);  
const decode = new ethers.utils.AbiCoder().decode([""address"", ""uint256""], payload)
```

From the ERC20 example:
```
        # Encode a transfer function call that returns the amount back to the depositor
        transfer_payload = TRANSFER_FUNCTION_SELECTOR + encode_abi(['address','uint256'], [depositor, amount])
        # Post voucher executing the transfer on the ERC-20 contract: ""I don't want your money""!
        voucher = {""address"": erc20, ""payload"": ""0x"" + transfer_payload.hex()}

Also, I wouldn't advise changing the template folder, as this will affect any dapp that you build. Instead, you could copy the files after you create the custom dapp.
To summarize, the 'update' procedure should be:
- Create the custom dapp `./create-dapp.sh voting`
- Copy the source files from the old version to the new `voting` version (as you are using python, include all .py files and requirements.txt).
- Copy (or edit accordingly) the aux files dapp.json, Dockerfile, docker-bake.override.hcl, and entrypoint.sh to the new `voting` version.","",""

When you have multiple validator nodes involved, one should be mindful of giving enough time for inputs+challenge phase.

For a voucher to be finalized, its input has to go through the entire accumulation phase. After that, the epoch that contains the input that contains that voucher will be sealed. Then it depends on disputes, either the validators react promptly (beginning of the challenge period) and it gets finalized quickly Or, the validators wait till the end of the challenge period and then that gets added to the estimation.

These frameworks generally test transactions per second (TPS) and in our case it makes sense to benchmark the speed of the processing of your DApp. In order to do that the best approach is including some script that performs the task you wish to benchmark inside your DApp build. Once you did it, you can use the docker image generated during the DApp build (called cartesi/dapp:<YOUR_DAPP_NAME_HERE>-devel-console) which has this script as default command - https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples/blob/main/docker/run-machine-console.sh :
```
cartesi-machine \
    --ram-length=128Mi \
    --rollup \
    --flash-drive=label:dapp,filename:dapp.ext2 \
    --flash-drive=label:root,filename:rootfs.ext2 \
    --ram-image=linux-5.5.19-ctsi-5.bin \
    --rom-image=rom.bin \
    -i \
    -- ""/bin/sh""
```and overwrite the command to bash:
```
docker run -it --rm cartesi/dapp:<YOUR_DAPP_NAME_HERE>-devel-console bash
```
Once inside this docker container, you can use a similar command to the entrypoint script, but replacing it with your benchmark script and using the `time` tool to measure how long it takes (as the time should be measured from outside of the Cartesi Machine, time inside the Cartesi Machine passes at an arbitrary pace, depending on the overhead to emulate each instruction executed):

```
time cartesi-machine \
    --ram-length=128Mi \
    --rollup \
    --flash-drive=label:dapp,filename:dapp.ext2 \

I was able to reproduce the issue. 
Cryptodomex uses compiled libs, so you should avoid using pre-compiled during pip installation (--no-binary option), and you should also define the compiler variables to compile for riscv.

"886909209629835264","riseandshaheen","10/02/2023 2:16 pm","The general concept of rollups applies to Cartesi with some key design decisions. From a user’s pov, it does feel similar to how you’d interact with L1 smart contracts. The transaction still happens on-chain but the execution is off-chain. With Cartesi Rollups, you compute off-chain inside the Cartesi Machine, a RISC-V based deterministic VM. The execution environment is a key difference to other rollups as you get Linux with a sophisticated developer tooling. You can run good old languages and libraries in a decentralized manner. There are no gas associated computations inside the Cartesi machine but you do incentivize the validator nodes for submitting proofs of computation on-chain. Just like any other rollups solution, you are required to move data and assets to Cartesi DApps. We have a similar mechanism of teleporting assets such that they have representation inside a specific DApp Rollup. In case of any disputes, you fall back to the base layer for resolution. High computational scalability with app-specific rollups design and a better developer tooling(Linux runtime) while still keeping the security guarantees of the underlying chain sets Cartesi apart. Hope it gives more clarity! 🙂","","👍 (1),🚀 (1)"

"886909209629835264","riseandshaheen","13/02/2023 12:21 pm","Sure I’ll try to explain this part! So we know the architecture of a Rollups DApp has both on-chain and off-chain components. The on-chain components include smart contracts for functions like submitting inputs, receiving outputs, depositing assets etc. The off-chain components read data emitted by the blockchain and process it.
Coming to teleporting the assets, for a user, it depends on the DApp developer how they want to show deposits and withdrawals on the front-end. You could think of it as a DApp specific user wallet. To dig in the details, let’s take the example of the Voting DApp, when you deposit some CTSI(or any other erc20 token), you essentially interact with a smart contract function → `erc20Deposit`. We call this on-chain component, the *Portal*. Your tokens gets transferred to this portal contract, it encodes the data and emits it as input msg to the off-chain component. The encoded msg structure represents your assets off-chain. Refer structure here https://github.com/cartesi/rollups/blob/main/onchain/rollups/contracts/facets/ERC20PortalFacet.sol#L45
Once the deposit msg is emitted, it is now upto the DApp’s backend how it validates it and adds logic around it. Here’s how Voting DApp is processing this deposit call https://github.com/Sotatek-ManhNguyen3/cartesi_voting_system/blob/feature/profiles/voting.py#L257

Again, on moving outputs of a DApp back to the blockchain, a similar kind of msg calling happens but this time with proofs of validity attached. 
There are other internal components that talk to each other in moving data to and from the blockchain. If you wanna dig deeper, the diagrams and references in docs explain this very well. Here https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/components/","","Cartesi01 (1)"

We currently do not have a sequencer, so these are my personal thoughts and how I'd go about it (maybe other team members would have different opinions):

We're app-specific rollups, so the ""validity"" of inputs varies from dapp to dapp. On the other hand, the input comes through an L1 contract, so there are some guarantees around that! I think a sequencer should guarantee some basic stuff about transactions—conformity to the agreed-upon format, the validity of the signatures, etc.

I also think the sequencer should be responsible for guaranteeing to order every once in a while. Otherwise, you don't get any gains in usability from the dapp perspective (faster transactions, for instance) apart from reduced costs (batching the transactions). And yeah, I see the possibility for both trusted and untrusted sequencers, which can also be defined on the application level! Trusted sequencers (or dapp approved sequencers) would have some advantages ordering-wise to improve the application's usability. Untrusted sequencers, I guess, would only serve the cost purpose.

What do you think?","",""
"473928575922470932","min6415","16/02/2023 10:38 pm","Thanks @felipeargento That make sense. Also, for app specific rollup, if I understand it correctly, the transaction ordering is going to be specific to dApp and the rollup would be ok with handling ordering constraints ( not guarantee by the sequencer)","",""
"221745360337502208","felipeargento","16/02/2023 11:34 pm","I think a sequencer that guarantees ordering is much more powerful. If someone interacts with an application through a sequencers that guarantees ordering (at least of the transactions that it received), they know the effects of their actions before the whole batch is posted on the base layer. Therefore, their interaction with the application is much faster than if they had to wait until the batch was posted on L1 and the block got sufficiently deep to be stable.

For applications in which the order of inputs is not very impactful for big windows of time (say a game with commit a reveal scheme) or an application which reorders transactions based on other arbitrary system, then the definition of order given by the sequencer is less important.

However, I'd bet that the big majority of applications would go for sequencers that could handle and guarantee ordering every x seconds, that'd be a key feature imo","","cartesiIdea (1)"

About MEV, yeah...I was thinking about that the other day! I don't think it is solved because the mev agent can run/simulate all the pieces of the stack, no?

Currently there are 2 possible build options in the rollups examples and I think this is the problem you are facing https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-examples#build-strategies
The toolchain option, which uses a toolchain image so you could cross compile stuff to the Cartesi machine
And the emulated riscv option, which you can apt install files, compile, and all binaries will already be for riscv

So in your case I imagine you want apt install the dependencies, so you should use a riscv image such as cartesi/python:3.10-slim-jammy, cartesi/node:19-jammy-slim, or riscv64/ubuntu:22.04
Besides, the file docker-bake.hcl should be removed and you should create a link for  riscv bake file ` ln -sr ../build/docker-riscv/base.hcl docker-bake.hcl`
I did some tests here and the docker image creation succeeded with this Dockerfile:
```

However, I'm using the `riscv64-cartesi-linux-gnu-g++` compiler provided in `cartesi/toolchain:0.12.0` to compile the shared library and using the same toolchain to build the cartesi-machine.

I expect that the shared library should be compatible with the cartesi-machine since they are generated by the same version of the toolchain.

Here is the command for compiling the shared library:

Let's use the echo-python example as our reference. 

How can I install dependencies when building a Docker image? I tried adding them to requirements.txt, but when trying to build using `docker buildx bake --load` , it says the dependencies are missing. Also tried adding them using RUN command in the Dockerfile but failed 

Hoping you could help out here=]","",""

So, the echo-python is not a good example to increment into because it uses the old build. In the old build, to install libraries, you would need to cross-compile them to RISC-V.
It would be best if you started from a project that uses the new build, such as the `calculator` or the `sqlite`.","",""
"408395884804571136","arthurvianna","21/09/2023 8:12 pm","I managed to build a project with the libraries you want (web3 and eth_account). So, you can follow the steps below to reproduce.
1) Add the libraries to `the requirements.txt`.
```txt
requests == 2.23.0
web3
eth_account
```

2)  Change the Dockerfile. (I think it is a good approach to separate the build and the actual runtime images)
```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker.io/docker/dockerfile:1.4
FROM --platform=linux/riscv64 cartesi/python:3.10-slim-jammy as build-stage

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential=12.9ubuntu3 \
    && apt install -y --no-install-recommends curl \
    && rm -rf /var/apt/lists/*

# install rust compiler
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
# Add .cargo/bin to PATH
ENV PATH=""/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}""

RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH=""/opt/venv/bin:$PATH""

COPY ./requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache \
    && find /usr/local/lib -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -r {} +

# runtime stage: produces final image that will be executed
FROM --platform=linux/riscv64 cartesi/python:3.10-slim-jammy

COPY --from=build-stage /opt/venv /opt/venv

WORKDIR /opt/cartesi/dapp
COPY ./entrypoint.sh .
COPY ./your_dapp.py .
```
3) Change the `entrypoint.sh` (You you need to add the venv copied to the PATH).
```shell
set -e
export PATH=""/opt/venv/bin:$PATH""
rollup-init python3 your_dapp.py
