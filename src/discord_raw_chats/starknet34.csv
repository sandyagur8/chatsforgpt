- Implementing proper incentives for shareholders. Cold start problem tends to be more persistent than it seems.
- Giving shareholders  tools to design proper governance, and helping them understand, measure and adjust platform risk 
- (In case of federated learning)  Implement server-side security. Models shared across the network must be resistant to ""brain-drain"" and implement differential-privacy.
That being said I don't see anything wrong with this paper. It's just that building infrastructure is just a top of the iceberg - in order to ""scale for industry needs"" we need to address much broader issues.","","👍 (5)"

In 2017 that we first came up with the idea for Game of Blocks. We launched the first version in 2018: we were inspired by well-known board games such as Risk, Catan and Monopoly. Game of Blocks was a multi-player strategy game (browser based) which enables you earn ETH rewards for each game you win! In a way, it was one of the first play to earn game...

As I have been digging deeper into L2 and Stark I have been getting convinced it might be the solution we will go with on the launch of our NFT marketplace.

We are launching our virtual company NFTs -> https://www.Blue.ceo/home

and the staging version is here if you're curious.
https://blueapp.us/1

The main thing we wanted to use Stark for is when we launch our in-game Points/coins that will allow users to trade these virtual companies as a play to earn game

Looking forward to getting your thoughts and possibly joining our team as we build out the full marketplace, swap and L2 protocol","","blue (5),👍 (2)"

Today we release our open source StarkNet wallet browser extension as a developers preview! 🎉 🔥 

https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x

Chrome Web Store review is still pending, and we'll add an easy way to install the extension as soon as it gets approved, but you can start buidl today! It uses the known Provider and Signer API which was first introduced by starknet.js. There's also an example DApp deployed where you can put the wallet to the test, as soon as you got it running!

Project is called `Jibe` Learn 2 Earn:
- donations are made to ""Subject"" treasuries 
- a ""Subject DAO"" then votes on the curation of the curriculum/exams
- as curriculum/exams are rolled out users can complete to earn
- users sign passed exams and DAO votes can then be gated by users that have demonstrated competency on-chain
- DAO votes can be gated by other on-chain factors as well(i.e. lifespan of address, # of interactions with various contracts, etc)

Example:
- The Constitution DAO raised $40Million and stumbled into a FDV of $400Million
- Constitution DAO donates 10,000,000 $PEOPLE to a Jibe treasury
- CDAO votes on the content curation team and to distribute 100,000 $PEOPLE/week until curriculum covering the history and pertinence of the US Constitution is complete
- CDAO votes to approve curriculum
- CDAO votes to pay anyone who completes curriculum and passes exam 20,000 $PEOPLE
- Certain CDAO votes are now gated not by # of $PEOPLE, but by DAO members that have demonstrated competency in whatever values the DAO has decided are pertinent

Non-DAO votes(pie in the sky):
- binary questions that are gated by people demonstrating competency on various subjects
- addresses that have demonstrated competency on-chain in ""Climatology"" can answer the question: ""Are humans catalyzing climate change?""
- results are demonstrated with the percentage of respondents for each to give people a basic heuristic of what subject matter experts think","","🤯 (1),🙂 (1)"

• Buying/selling of NFTs once ETH bridging is available
• MetaMask support (post ETH-SN adapter)
• Launching on StarkNet Mainnet (once approved by the StarkWare team)
• Ability to deploy your custom NFT collection for your users to trade

Walks through building a ""blackbox"" for cars, with a simple ownership + permissions system. Includes dev exercises and answers along the way. By the end, you will:
- write a unit tested Cairo contract
- utilize important building blocks like signature verification
- deploy the contract on testnet
- interact with it from a python application

A small group of us are looking at building a Fixed rate USD loan protocol. The existing money market protocols like Aave do not fully capture the term structure of rates i.e. what is the fixed rate for 3months / 6months / 12months etc. This term structure is effectively the yield/funding curve which is an important primitive in finance.

We have come up with a design which we think addresses the problem. You can find a link here to the litepaper (only 5 papers) which is hosted on google docs: 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rrYC32w63FzzV61rJWqqYomEMgfZ3cRR1jOlJmnnxeY/edit?usp=sharing

I'm also happy to send it to you directly as a pdf if you have concerns on the link. We are looking for 2 things:

1) Some criteria feedback on the design - are we missing anything / will this work / why wont it work
2) We looking for people that are passionate about finance / starknet who could help bring this to life

Just a quick update, CurveZero is a fixed rate loan protocol thats being built on Starknet. We have made great progress over the last 6 months, with the Cairo codebase being 60-70% complete. Like other lend borrow protocols, liquidity providers deposit USDC into the protocol and borrowers can access this money at fixed rates and at any term they choose. Whereas most lend borrow protocols set the rate of interest based on pool sizes and simple formula's, CurveZero instead relies on external pricing oracles to more accurately capture the correct interest rate at any term.

This more efficient pricing mechanism allows for higher utilization and fairer interest rates. The graph below shows the rates that the pricing oracles would provide at different terms, naturally these are constantly changing as the markets move. The pricing oracles use defi / cefi and tradfi data to create this curve. The important thing to note is there is no longer 1 fixed rate for all terms, that's a thing of the past. Borrowers get a fair / efficient market related rate which increases utilization.

If you passionate about defi and starknet, and want to work on some of the most difficult problems in the space, feel free to reach out. CurveZero's twitter and github links below:

Argent X v3.2.0  will enable you to view your Account history with friendly support from @voyager team !
We also switched from backup files to seed phrases to provide a more common backup method, which you can still use when you forget your password. As you all know we at Argent are no huge fans of Seed Phrases, and therefore we're already working on an smart contract wallet alternative, maybe you can already spot something 🙂 
Additionally you can now add/edit/remove custom networks as a last minute feature, which got requested by the StarkWare team in the context of the Hackaton!

Full release notes can be found here: https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x/releases/tag/v3.2.0

My goal is to implement an efficient post-quantum VRF using STARKS (if possible). My statement consists of many sparse multivariate quadratic (MQ) polynomials. The PRF evaluator essentially wants to prove that they know the zeros of this MQ system over the STARK prime field. Before I'd invest much time and energy in coding this up in Cairo, I'd like to understand the proof size that I might have. Could anyone give me some hints, and estimates? A toy example of the circuit the PRF evaluator uses can be found here in Figure 4. (https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/182.pdf). The current state-of-the-art PQ-secure VRF has a proof size of 3KB. My understanding of the original zkSTARK paper is that if one has a multiplicative complexity larger than 2^15, then the proof size will be larger than 100KB, see also Figure 3 here https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pd.

I'd like to introduce my project, **Stash**. 

Its a two-parter:  

- **Stash Protocol** - a collection of Starknet smart contracts written in cairo that allows users to securely lock digital assets and tie them to any location in the metaverse (arbitrary string like URL, GPS coordinates, etc). Any user with knowledge of the location and correct set of keys may unlock the stash and claim its contents.
https://github.com/Stash-Ex/stash-protocol

- **Stash Extension** - a browser extension that enables new interactions and engagement with the web. Built on the Stash Protocol, this web extension allows one to stash digital assets on any website as well as discover and claim stashes left by others, in an entirely permissionless manner.
https://github.com/Stash-Ex/stash-extension

Please have a look at the Github repositories for more information. Both the Stash protocol and extension have roadmaps full of features and enhancements supporting new use-cases. There are additional things that need to be built such as backends, dedicated UI, SDKs for game development (AR/VR), and premium features to support a diverse set of users. 
We are looking for anyone that is interested in the project and would like to 🛠️contribute🛠️. Please feel free to DM me or reach out via Github to discuss further.

Follow these instructions to install the Stash Extension and start creating and discovering stashes today! Both the protocol and extension are live on the goerli test net.
👉(https://github.com/Stash-Ex/stash-extension#installation)👈

Let me give introduction of Kooltek68 StarkNet Node:
```We are Infore Technology Corporation - The Biggest Social listening and Data Collection platform in Vietnam.
SMCC (short for Social Media Command Center) is a set of solutions that allow to ""listen"" and analyse public data, social behaviour, trending,... on social networks. 
From there, it helps individuals or businesses to take measures to handle and solve problems arising from information posted on social networks.
We are professional AI developer. We have been working on this industry for more than 11 years. 
Currently we are building an AI blockchain project that helps people to generate incomes just simply by (public) data mining. 
We call it ""Data to earn"". (aka DATALAC dot com)
Our project will be introduced for public next Q1 - 2023.
We see StarkNet as a promising layer-2 blockchain project that we can collaborate with our project and community in the future. 
So that is why we are running a full validator node. 
Hopefully, we can use Starknet to issue our own tokens. 
Thank you for reading.```","",""

Look forward to meeting the amazing community in Paris! DMs are open!

We are happy to present our StarkNet project - **__ZK Social Graph__**.

ZK Social Graph is a Web3, Lens Protocol compatible smart, contracts-based social graph for the StarkNet Ecosystem designed to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph. The protocol is built from the ground up with modularity in mind, allowing new features to be added while ensuring immutable user-owned content and social relationships.

Our goal is to build  StarkNet network based Social Graph and appropriate APIs enhanced with ZK security features, ZK badges, combining ZK-Rollup scalability and L2 transaction speed.

Next steps: Social Graph core features development, security and privacy R&D.

Happy to meet you in Starknet.cc 🥳 🇫🇷

I'm currently building a project called KAMEN 👀

KAMEN is a blockchain-based Party-to-Earn mobile app where festival-goers own a NFT mask 👺

We aims to reward festival-goers through a loyalty system represented by the evolution of NFT masks. Depending on the rarity and level of the NFT mask, its holder is eligible for two types of rewards:

  - Digital Rewards & Physical Rewards

Each NFT mask is equipped with an experience bar and attributes, which provides specific advantages during festival events. 

We want to develop the first web3 festival community, where owner of a NFT mask becomes a KAMEN loyal ambassador and is rewarded with unique advantages during festival events. So, you can see these NFT masks as social tokens 🔗

To provide the next gen NFT/IP infrastructure and utilities, Comoco are building:

> **1.Comoco Licensor **is built on StarkNet in form of a serial new Layer 2 protocols for NFT, which support NFT licensing and trading on both L1 and L2.

> **2. Comoco Sculptor **is transforming 2D profile pictures to 3D avatars which are minted as derived NFTs with Comoco Licensor protocol. It enables your 2D NFTs fully animatable and usable in video meetings and more!

> **3. Comoco Lens **is the utility application and showcase to use the 3D avatars for video calls, recording, AR/VR, games and metaverse.

> **4. Comoco Marketplace** is the first marketplace based on Comoco Licensor protocols and introducing ‘NFT Series’ format, which includes original NFT, derived NFT, leasing and sub-licensing trading in the same IP series.

> **5. Comoco Crew** is our first NFT collection of animated 3D avatars with full-body rigging and usable in online meetings & more!

Therefore, we would love to get an impression on your current test management approach. Where do you currently see the pain points for smart contract testing (especially for integration and system tests) on StarkNet?

I am from the Fjord Foundry team (We were previously known as Copper Launch). I'd love to chat with you about what we are building and to see how we can support you via Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs).

We’ve hosted 100’s of new projects on our platform, which have generated over $750m in liquidity while supporting over $1.5 billion in volume. Our platform has been built to ensure that liquidity generation events are fair, open and transparent meaning that launch events are not impacted by whales, sniper bots and bad actors. This ensures that your project is more sustainable and has true community members invested, allowing you to build an army of ambassadors to supercharge your growth. 

Please let us know if you're up to learning more via a deck or a call as the use cases for Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools don’t end at liquidity generation events which we’d love to explore further with you (e.g. Protocol Owned Liquidity). 

Shout out if you have any questions and thanks for taking the time to read this message.

We will also be present at the upcoming Sessions in Tel Aviv.
 
Our product is a wallet infrastructure that allows you (through API) to easily deploy bank-grade wallets seamlessly behind your own platform. We separate security and control of the private key as two different concepts, each private key is generated in 7 pieces spread across different regions of the world and never touched by anyone. The control part is then distributed to the client or end user, either through a JWT or biometrics - meaning users can literally be their own keys (fingerprint or face scan natively on their registered devices - natural 2FA without seed phrases or passwords). 

Some bullet points:
* Deploy your own wallets seamlessly, either full custody or non-custodial without any exposure to private keys, no need for users to remember seed phrases or passwords.
* Granular policy engine to decide who can do what with which assets, with whose approval, to protect yourself and your users from FTX-style internal fraud.
* Scalable to billions of wallets. 
* Works with practically speaking any blockchain and smart contract on the lower level of the API (if you can provide a hash) for advanced interactions
* We're well-funded, impressive team like ex-CISO from Bitgo, CEO, CTO with decades in banks, some of the most cited cryptographers in the world, just to mention a few (feel free to review the competence on Linkedin) 

If you have a project on Stark or in general and want to test out buidling with us, feel free to ping me here. I'm very keen to connect with you personally as I see Stark as a high priority for us.

Starksport is a sports inspired project built on the StarkNet network. The project is aimed at crypto users who are passionate and have a real love for football. By applying blockchain technology and building on Web 3.0 platform, Starksport aims to provide a user-friendly experience. 

1.    We create events on the world's top leagues and major events. We have now launched two collections of NFTs, the English Premier League logo and the Champions League jersey (Our First NFT Animated 3D Collection).
2.    Random NFT with your favorite team logo in the box. One of the key features of the Starksport Collect is the special NFT events that happen when the NFT owner's team wins the championship. In such a case, the NFT holders will receive 80% of the total minted NFT fees, divided equally among all holders. NFTs represent their favorite team, people can exchange and buy at a reasonable price that they can pay on the market to own their favorite NFTs.
4.    In addition to sports, we also develop financial applications such as:
- Swap
- More liquidity
- Create/Manage pairs + liquidity groups
- Bridge
- Staking
- Lending network
All these utilities will be completed according to the schedule that we have outlined.                                                                                                                                            Nice to meet you in StarkNet!","","🔥 (4)"

We are from Datalac.com, we are looking to apply for grants from Starkware foundation and develope our project in the Starknet ecosystem. Could we ask how to apply and what are the requirements?
Summary of our Datalac:
```
Data is the new oil for new software engines (Artificial Intelligence) in the era of digital transformation.
 
1. Datalac creates a platform of crowdsourcing network for everyone to 'suck oil' (data mining as a natural resource) from public internet. It is the data to earn game.
2. Then the oil can be poured into different silos (datalakes) with different refineries (dataverses). The first silo shall be Datalac Social datalake then users can have their own datalakes.
3. From there, the oil will be refined into 'petro fuel' and other valuable data-driven products, with the support of Datalac's AI search engine. 
4. These data products can be used in many cases, providing values for:
• Individuals (virtual assistant AI) ~ Opendatalac Personal.
• Businesses (decision making, strategy, marketing ans sales) ~ Opendatalac Enterprise.
• Societies (open knowledge repositories) ~ opensource Datalac.
5. AI software engines consume data to run and vice versa, AI engines help to refine raw data (oil) into valuable data-driven products | services (petro fuel...) in datalac.com
-----
All in one ~ a whole Datalac circular ecosystem called Datalac AI Economy.
In this economy, we have an intermediate exchange means called $DTVN blockchain token to balance the supply and demand. The $DTVN represents the faith of Datalac Community with the decentralized network (similar to Bitcoin), the data and the power of AI.

I’m Mabel, marketing from Desig, a blockchain-agnostic multisig solution, enhancing a Trustless ecosystem with multi-fa & social recovery. we’re interested in deploying on Starknet (expected this June) so I thought I should introduce ourselves and discuss potential support with everyone here. 

We are only at the start of 2023 now, and the Web3 market already lost over 180 million dollars over 155 hacks. This situation is why we decided to build **Desig Protocol - a blockchain-agnostic multisig solution.**

Desig divides the master key into shares and gives each signer a share to keep. When someone proposes a transaction, each signer will use their key shares to approve or reject. If Desig collects enough approvals, the key shares will be combined into a valid master key. This way, even if one signer’s key share is compromised, the attacker won't be able to recreate the whole master key. Signers can also be added or removed easily. **The key shares are automatically sent to all members added, so no time is wasted**

There are no differences between Desig’s combined signature and other single-key wallet’s master key signatures. Since all DApps are designed to be compatible with standard single-key wallets, naturally, **Desig is compatible with all DApps.
**
By applying TSS off-chain, Desig is smart contract-less, so there is no point in failure to exploit, and **no fee is charged** in the process. Due to its blockchain-agnostic nature, **Desig is naturally scalable**. It doesn’t rely on smart contracts, which means no devs are required to bridge Desig to any new chain.

To learn more about Desig and what services we may bring, follow our socials: https://link3.to/desiglabs

Let me know if you are interested so we can discuss it. Thank you","",""

An open source project I developed was online, website is: https://zk-ns.xyz
open code: https://github.com/zk-ns/zk-name-service--cairo1.0
This is a decentralized community domain name project. Here, users can purchase and use domain name services at extremely low prices. It only costs 0.001ETH to purchase a 6-digit domain name a year, which is about 1.8 USDT.
After the user purchases the domain name, he is immediately eligible to mint governance tokens (NGT Token). The total amount of governance tokens is 1.1 billion, of which 1 billion are minted after purchasing domain names, and 100 million are used for user pledge mining. The distribution of 1.1 billion is fair. Only users who purchase domain names are eligible to mint coins. The developer share is 0, which is completely decentralized.

About Minting Shares
The user minting actually gets 80% of the shares, the other 10% is given to the promoters, and 10% is given to the community leader.
For example:
Users spend 0.001ETH to purchase a domain name with 6 digits or above for 1 year, can mint 1,000 NGTs, actually get 800 NGTs, promoters get 100 NGTs, and community leaders get 100 NGTs;
Users spend 0.002ETH to purchase a domain name with 6 digits or above for 2 years, can mint 2,000 NGTs, actually get 1,600 NGTs, promoters get 200 NGTs, and community leaders get 200 NGTs;
Users spend 0.002ETH to purchase a 5-digit domain name for 1 year, can mint 2,000 NGTs, actually get 1,600 NGTs, promoters get 200 NGTs, and community leaders get 200 NGTs;
Users spend 0.004ETH to purchase a 5-digit domain name for 2 years, can mint 4,000 NGTs, actually get 3,200 NGTs, promoters get 400 NGTs, and community leaders get 400 NGTs;","",""

"569811676115763200","williamfu#9792","05/07/2023 7:06 am","Shares are written into smart contracts based on this algorithm. When all 1 billion pieces are minted, users can continue to purchase and use domain name services, but they cannot mint NGT.

About Promotion
Promoters get 10% of their promoters' minting shares, and community leaders get 10% of community members' minting shares.
Users must purchase a domain name in order to become a promoter, otherwise the corresponding address is invalid.

About The Community Leader
In order to facilitate project promotion, community attributes can also be used for subsequent social projects and game projects. For example, the community leader can broadcast messages to community members, and in games, members of the community need to compete for internal community rankings and cooperate. To compete with other communities and other scenarios, so the concept of community and community leader was established.
To become a community leader, the address must first be a valid address (that is, the address that has purchased the domain name), and second, you need to spend 0.01ETH to become the leader (10% to the promoter, 10% to the original community leader).
After becoming a community leader, all invited members belong to the community and enjoy the treatment of 10% of the minting shares of community members.

About The Future
As the community grows, social applications or gamefi will be developed based on the attributes of the community, and all routes will be determined by the community.","",""

We are reaching out to introduce you to an exciting development in our ecosystem. We are proud to announce the launch of the SPACE ID 3.0 toolkit, designed to empower projects and ecosystems to launch their own Top-Level Domains (TLDs).

Our toolkit is designed for ease of use, so all details can be tailored to your preferences. This includes domain length, pre-registration rules, domain registration prices, and more.
Furthermore, your domains will have the opportunity to be listed on the SPACE ID 3.0 domain marketplace. This provides your users with a one-stop platform to manage and trade your domains seamlessly.

If the prospect of a branded domain aligns with your roadmap and goals, we are excited to explore potential collaboration possibilities.
Are you interested in launching your own customized domain with SPACE ID? happy to connect you with official team.
