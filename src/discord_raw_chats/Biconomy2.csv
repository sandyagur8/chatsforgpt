1. In contract based approach, a smart contract wallet is created for each user (on login) and while you send the transaction (be it approve or transferFrom) the transaction flow on blockchain is 
[Biconomy Relay Hub Contract] => [User Smart Contract Wallet] => [Dapp smart contract]

So here msg.sender will be user's contract wallet address and not your client account address. 
In this case you need to store your tokens in user's contract wallet address.

2. In Native meta transactions, there's no contract wallet involved but you need to get rid of msg.sender and msg.value properties from your smart contract in order for it to work by enabling native meta transactions in your smart contract.","",""

But I am accesing remote approve method of DAI erc20 smart contract(`0x4f96fe3b7a6cf9725f59d353f723c1bdb64ca6aa`), at that time it approves with another address of biconomy  in msg.sender instead of my contract address","",""

"595680520625717248","sachintomar","11/04/2020 12:58 pm","ok and have you created some smart contract layer also? or just the User interface that directly communicates with these ERC20 tokens?","",""

"595680520625717248","sachintomar","11/04/2020 1:07 pm","Ok so the case of DAI is different from other ERC20 tokens... coz Dai has a permit function (alternate of approve) that has native meta transaction enabled..
Lets see how you can do DAI transfer using meta transactions:
1. You call permit function using native meta transaction way, and give approval to some other address.
2. Now if you want gasless transfer also, that some other address can't be an Externally owned account (say metamask address), coz if you call transfer function using native meta tx,msg.sender would be different.
3. So you give approval using permit function to a smart contract (which you'll make), which'll a transfer function that internally calls DAI transferFrom function, so flow would be 
[Biconomy Relayer] => [Your smart contract]=> [Dai Token]
so when it check msg.sender in transferFrom function, it'll be your smart contract address which has already got approval using permit function","",""
"595680520625717248","sachintomar","11/04/2020 1:11 pm","Now in case of other ERC20 tokens, which don't have the permit function like DAI, you have to take the Smart Contract Wallet approach, which all wallets are doing who are providing gasless transfers..
So each user first create a smart contract wallet (APIs are given in biconomy SDK for these) and transaction flow would be like
1. Transfer
[Biconomy Relay Contract] => [User smart contract wallet] => [ERC20 Token]
msg.sender in transfer function is user's smart contract wallet where tokens are stored.

No need to approve and transferFrom here, you can directly use transfer function using meta transactions","",""

*Biconomy Pros:*
- Dashboard for developers to more granular control on meta transaction usage.
- Quick 2 step integration with no extra smart contract deployments.
- No need to worry about protocol changes or new trends on blockchain. Biconomy makes sure the system is upto date with market trends.
- Less gas per transaction as no extra hops on-chain and payments are processed off-chain.
- Gas fee can be paid in stable tokens, ERC20 tokens or Fiat.

*Biconomy Cons:*
- Not decentralized, so need to trust biconomy servers for processing transaction.


*GSN Pros:*
- Decentralized system, so no need to trust any single relayer.
- GSN2 is simpler than GSN1, so comparatively easy to setup.
- Relayers can be paid in ERC20 tokens while paying back the fees.

*GSN Cons:*
- Extra setup is required.
- High relayers fees.
- Regular monitoring on DApp funds is required to repay the relayers.
- High transaction fee, as extra processing done on chain like multiple hops, checking dapp deposits, relayer payments.","",""

Transaction(relayer) nonce is being managed by biconomy so that's not the problem here..

Since you are using contract wallet approach, biconomy contract wallet actually supports multi dimensional nonce.. but mexa sdk by default uses batchId as 0

To solve your issues, changes needs to be done at SDK level where you send a different batchId..

The RelayHub contract approach was used to do meta transaction via a Contract Wallet IdentityProxy.sol

But still since you asked, here is the flow used by that approach..
1. Add relayer via function addRelayer in RelayHub.sol
2. Create a smart contract wallet for user by calling createIdentityProxy() method of RelayHub.sol
3. Call RelayHub.sol foward method using your relayer by passing required parameters, including encoded ""Hello"" function data..
And to create the signatures on client side you can checkout this part in the sdk https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa-sdk/blob/master/src/index.js#L681","",""

But to give you the idea..
1. First you have to make your contracts EIP2771 compatible and set the trustedForwarder address 
2. You can find the TrustedForwarder implementation here with support of EIP712 signature and personal signature https://github.com/bcnmy/mexa/blob/master/contracts/6/forwarder/BiconomyForwarder.sol
Note: This is not final commit.
3. Then your transaction flow would be like this..

End User sign transaction params -> Relayer -> TrustedForwarder( executeEIP712() or executePersonalSign()) -> Your Hello function call (via call() method)

You can find client side implementation without using Biconomy SDK here, https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/forwarder-metatx-api/example/react-ui/src/App.js

We are very close to completing our integration, everything is functional except for executing meta transactions with dynamic types, such as `string` -- we think this is specifically coming from the `abi.encodePacked`  in the metatx-standard contracts: https://github.com/bcnmy/metatx-standard/blob/mumbai-demo/src/contracts/EIP712MetaTransaction.sol#L38

When executing the transaction, the parameters aren't being passed/packed as expected. For example, here's a good tx (you can see the strings being passed in UTF-8): https://explorer-mumbai.maticvigil.com/tx/0xc37732fa397abc0bebaea66383524e626a31a6a7d0cdc71a70092a42e544ac56/internal-transactions

In your first transaction, you are calling your method directly, the first 4 bytes are your function selector 0xa411ef20

In second transaction, the function you are calling is executeMetaTransaction whose function selector will be different, hence first 4 bytes are different which are 0x0c53c51c

but if you see the data further, executeMetaTransaction takes the actual method signature as second parameter, so you can see your original function signature 0xa411ef20 somewhere in the middle of the data...

lets say on smart contract, chainId value is 137, while taking signature using metamask, it checks the selected network in metamask and value present in chainId fields in domainData and metamask reject the signature request if there's a mismatch... 

so to answer your question, if chainId on chain is 1, so yeah user wouldn't be able to use the app when connected to Matic network. However there is a solution for that.","",""

Smart Contract: In domain data on smart contracts, use ""uint256 salt"" field instead of ""uint256 chainId"", and keep the value of chainid only eg 137 on matic.
Client Changes: Use ""salt"" field in domainDataType and domainData object instead of chainId. and use the hardcoded value same as used on contract i.e. 137.

Now it doesn't matter on which network the user is on. And also metamask won't reject the signature request as there's no chainId field in domainData.","",""

*** let contract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESSES['mumbai'], testABI, biconomy.getSignerByAddress(userAddress))
 let { data } = await contract.populateTransaction.myFunction(tokenId)

 let txParams = {
    data: data,
    to: CONTRACT_ADDRESSES['mumbai'],
    from: userAddress,
    signatureType: ""EIP712_SIGN""
 }

let tx = await provider.send(""eth_sendTransaction"", [txParams])***

The data value ends up being something like this: **'1c19c2150bfb000500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'** which looks correct to me (signature + id)

However, I'm getting an error from my contract that this tokenID does not exist. I've double checked my GraphQL layer, the block explorer, and called other functions to see whether or not this exists and it definitely does. Upon looking deeper at the error, I see that the data that Biconomy is sending in the RPC call is this:

**'0x1c19c2150bfb000500000031fd452a72b07239ee1283a4c85d32b837c000000000000000'**

It seems to me that somewhere in the ***provider.send(""eth_sendTransaction"", [txParams])*** call, the data is being changed. 0xbfb000500000031fd452a72b07239ee1283a4c85d32b837c000000000000000 is no longer a token that exists. I'm not sure where the ***31fd452a72b07239ee1283a4c85d32b837c*** value in the middle is coming from... Any ideas?

SocialTokenFactory.sol -> Social.Token.sol

We only deploy SocialTokenFactory.sol, but we are inherting EIP2771 in the SocialToken.sol. These SocialToken.sol contracts are created dynamically by a calling a function on SocialTokenFactory.sol, so there is no way to know what their addresses will be ahead of time.

I'm now trying to perform a function contains `transferFrom` tx on Polygon and would like to call it on Eth using biconomy
I covered everything but to perform `transferFrom` tx, we should approve the amount first
The main issue I'm facing is there's no way to do `approve` tx using biconomy coz most of the erc20 tokens on Polygon not supporting.
Furthermore, to call `approve` method using biconomy I should register all tokens to my account

"532296397786185729","grall_","12/03/2022 8:19 pm","Hello! Hope all is well. We currently have a MVP centralized crypto exchange/trading application where users basically try to send their assets like USDC/USDT and they can trade within our system. This is all so far so good as we are creating wallets on our server and securing them on a KMS and the amounts are virtually traded within our system (sort of like Coinbase, Binance, etc.) but currently we are experiencing some issues for withdrawal of their USDT/USDC assets out of their designated wallets we created for them for which we have to have Ether in order to transfer the tokens. Our MVP currently estimates gas, transfers it to the wallet and goes ahead with the transaction but this model is incredibly flawed as we have to pay gas fees twice and wallets will have extra changes within them and managing them is a huge hassle.  

1. Now, gasless transactions seem to be what we need BUT based on the docs, we need to write smart contracts to handle transactions and they are revolving around having our own ERC-20 Tokens rather a third party ERC-20 like USDT/USDC (?), as such, I was wondering if this is possible to do it without writing smart contracts? If so, are there any guides/tutorials, etc for this specific approach? 

2. Also, if gasless is the way to go, can we divert the signatures to our own relayer to reduce costs of transfer within the network? 

Also any help/suggestion/criticism etc.. is truly appreciated. 

Many thanks in advance. 🍀","",""

https://gist.github.com/arcticfloyd1984/8e46ac89c1dd774a174c2406d1431586
Use complier version 0.8.9
A few things that are different and I updated:
1. You cant't use `setTrustedForwarder` as in `ERC2771Context.sol` it is a private immutable variable. Either you can inherit OpenGSN's `BaseRelayRecipient.sol` (https://github.com/opengsn/forwarder/blob/master/contracts/BaseRelayRecipient.sol) or locally flatten out ERC2771Context.sol and change it from `private immutable` to `internal`.
2. No need to override `versionRecipient` as that is required only if you use `BaseRelayRecipient.sol`.
3. Changed the ordering in which contracts are being inherited as that makes a difference in calling those contracts.","",""

let rawtx = Object({

I have been trading in crypto for ~12 months now. I was using BlockFolio to track my investments across exchanges. 

With the recent FTX debacle ( to which I lost a good portion of my portfolio) I am now looking for portfolio trackers that are convenient to use and can help me track all my assets accurately in real time. I have already tried most of the known ones and either they are paid, inaccurate or are loaded with too many unnecessary features. Looking for something that is low gimmick and have portfolio tracking as their main proposition.

It would be nice if they also offer taxation reports as per US standards (again most of the available once require hours of manual intervention)

Would be really helpful if you can drop in your recommendations. 
Thanks in advance.","",""

- forward flow - users paying gas fee in erc-20 can be done without any key
- gasless flow - Account abstraction flow, dapp developers will deposit in paymaster to make tx. While the new dashboard in [wip]. You can use they same key we have used for paymaster to try things out.","",""

One of our main contracts implements the trustedForwarder() standard and has set Biconomy as a trusted forwarder, but we haven't really gone too deep into the process of documenting it or directing our developer community toward using it yet.

I have registered factory contract (0x5DBC7B840baa9daBcBe9D2492E45D7244B54A2A0) and deployProxyByImplementation method for 2 networks (mumbai and goerli).

When I am using mumbai and passing mumbai apiId, apiKey it automatically trying to make transaction to (0x9399bb24dbb5c4b782c70c2969f58716ebbd6a3b - mumbai biconomy relayer address).

But when I am trying to use goerli and passing goerli apiId, apiKey, signing message with goerli network somehow it trying to call the same mumbai contract (0x9399bb24dbb5c4b782c70c2969f58716ebbd6a3b) withing goerli network.

the foremost being that the ""new Biconomy SDK"" provides a truly decentralized experience (non-custodial in nature)  due to it's smart contract wallet approach. 
In a nutshell, this smart contract wallet that get's deployed for each unique user provides for all sorts of customizations for developers that it offers. And hence becomes a one-stop solution for a seamless web2 like user experience.
These are the facilities you can leverage using the new sdk:
transaction bundling
gasless transactions
paying gas with ERC20 tokens
fiat onramps and offramps
social logins
on the other hand mexa only offers gasless and forward.

Paying gas with ERC20 tokens have the disadvantage  because we manage tokens to pay purchases that are not supported by Biconomy, so will have the same problem (before they have no gas and then they have no gas ERC20 tokens). Sometimes it will match and sometimes not our pay token and your supported ERC20 token to pay gas. (thinking in loud voice, may be when not matching let them choose a second token to pay gas supported by Biconomy). On the other side we have the gasless transactions. We were thinking that we can use this method with the particularity that before sending the transaction we get feeQuotes from you in order we can attach to the pay token the amount needed to refund us that gas so we can add in our contract function a swap and transfer to our gas tank in order to refund us the gas used. We can also make a mix of both methods regarding the circumstances. What do you think regarding your experience. Am I in the correct understanding?","",""

Then we send the transaction to our router on source chain which is in charge of swaps and cross. Cases in which input token or balance in another token matches Biconomy ERC20 token to pay for gas would be added to our transaction to be sent to your relayer. But in case there is no match we should quote how much of input token to add to the transaction to send to your relayer and use our gas tank to pay for the transaction.

If users pay gas with ERC20 supported tokens, there is no need for them to fund the smart account with ether. Instead, the smart account will use the ERC20 tokens as payment for the gas fees.When smartAccount.createRefundTransaction() is called, it estimates the gas required for the transaction, and then transfers that amount of ERC20 tokens from the user's wallet to the smart account. This is done before the actual transaction is sent to the network.","","👌 (1)"

You can make use of 2D nonces (send those with different batchId) and not worry about ordering or signature mismatch issue.
To sequence batchIds you can do an incremental order indefinitely. batchnonce will be queried from the contract for the user and batchId. Purpose here is for parallel transaction for same signer. 

BatchId should be different for same signer. If it was for different users or not parallel txns then batchId can always be 0 and 1D nonce will work.

Answering your question, the sdk has been developed to abstract all the blockchain complexities away from the users and provide them a more intuitive web2 like experience far from the worries of creating and maintaining a wallet and the heed to pay gas at every single transaction. This is being delivered through something known as Smart-Contract-Wallets (SCWs) which allows the developers to make custom transaction flow and also to do batching of transactions. Also users can perform batched transactions gaslessly too. 
Smart Accounts are nothing but an alias used for SCWs.
New Smart Accounts are created when a new user onboards your dApp without them even knowing it! 
I hope this clarifies stuff a little.

If they opt in, we will deploy the election contract which inherits from ERC2771Context. If they opt out, we will deploy the normal contract. The relevant function inside my contract can be modified as shown below:
```function getElection(Election.ElectionInfo memory _electionInfo, uint _ballotType, uint _resultCalculatorType, address _electionOrganizer, address _electionOrganizerContract) external onlyOrganizerContract returns(Election) {
        Election election;

                }
                return election;
    }

If the organizer chooses to opt-in for gasless transactions, I will redirect them to a new page with instructions on how to configure the smart contract for gasless transections on Biconomy dashboard, and from there they will have to manually configure their specific contract on Biconomy Dashboard,  Do you happen to know if there's a better alternative?","",""

a) I understand that with the SDK in my dApp, users can do transaction gasless. 
Can we do anykind of gas less transactions with any token, even if they don't have a PERMIT feature ? 

Example : I want users on my dApp to stake $CAKE on pancake swap smart contract. 
Normal smart contract integration requieres the user to APPROVE spending $CAKE and then the transaction for Staking his Cake.

How will that work with the SDK and Biconomy ?

    1. You have whitelisted the contracts

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to reach out and share with you an amazing investment platform that has been incredibly beneficial for me - HODLer Assets.

HODLer Assets (https://hodler-assets.com/) is an innovative platform that allows you to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with flexibility and transparency. The platform is designed to make trading easy and accessible to everyone, while also providing great returns on your investments.

One of the things I love most about HODLer Assets is its transparency. You can track your investments in real-time and have complete control over your trades. Plus, the platform offers a range of investment options to suit your needs, from short-term to long-term investments.

Another great feature of HODLer Assets is their referral program. When you refer your friends to the platform, you can earn a generous reward for each person who signs up and starts trading. This means that not only can you earn great returns on your own investments, but you can also earn even more by simply sharing the platform with your friends and family.

Since I started using HODLer Assets, I have made a whole lot of money, and the referral program has been a huge bonus. It's a win-win situation - I get to earn rewards for sharing the platform with my friends, and my friends get to benefit from the same flexible and transparent investment opportunities that I have been enjoying.

If you're looking for a flexible and transparent way to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while earning great returns, I highly recommend giving HODLer Assets a try. So why not visit (https://hodler-assets.com/) today and start enjoying the benefits that I have been enjoying?

Let me know if you have any questions, and I would be happy to help.

On Matic the smart contract account is being formed and it is also sponsored by the paymaster deployed successfully but when I am trying to do the transaction it is failing and giving me this error the eoa account has sufficient funds and the contract is also whitelisted on the paymaster . I have also tried sending funds to the contract account made but it is not accepting because it does not seem to have any fallback and receive function in it .

Hello , we wonder if we can have precise permission control for every txn that we will pay for ? or can we have any api or setting in dashboard ?

Currently we are testing the biconomy SDK , and we found out that it can only control for which contract we permit , and which function in the contract we allow .  But we can't control for which txn we allow , or which txn we will pay for . 

It's that possible to make such role permission control for gas control ? 😀

The contracts we have use the EIP 2771 standard.
https://docs-gasless.biconomy.io/products/enable-gasless-transactions/choose-an-approach-to-enable-gasless/eip-2771

One method of our contract sends a fee of a token ERC20 to an account and the rest to an end user.

We have a case where the user made a transfer to the Biconomy API and it was the other way around, without using the forwarder in the first instance. The two transactions that occurred are:

I wanted to send batch transactions to the relayer.

As a starting point there are two transactions.
1. Signed by a user wallet and interacting with the smart contract method 1
2. Signed by a owner wallet and interacting with the smart contract method 2

I wanted to have this executed in the same relayer transaction.
Is this directly possible or is there a workaround for this ?

const signer = provider.getSigner() `
to get the signer. and to be completely honest in my development process, i have been using a combination of sdks to get the results that i have desired including my own wallet implementation and havent gotten to the point where im even using a front end. The use of the AA is kinda hard to comprehend and is not how we normally interact with an EVM. so through my frustration i had to deconstruct everything down to the simplest form and build from there. like using the userop.js library so that you understand the what is really going on before moving into what biconomy has created.  that may help a bit. here is also something that really helped me grasp some of these concepts https://learnweb3.io/lessons/build-an-entire-aa-wallet-from-scratch/","",""

I am starting on the AA SDK and I read -

Smart accounts are counterfactual in nature. We know their address before they are even deployed. In this instance we won’t immediately deploy it, it will automatically be deployed on the first transaction it initiates and the gas needed for deployment will be added to that first transaction.

Is there a way to deploy these smart accounts like a method ?
