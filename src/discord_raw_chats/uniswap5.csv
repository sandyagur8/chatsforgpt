 TWAP cumulative prices from the pair contracts. Let me explain.

Suppose that I have a contract that simulates an option-like instrument for a given asset on Uniswap, say, `TKN/ETH`. Then, if the price/ratio is above `X` (strike price), a premium could be collected.

We could create a very simple oracle that update the price every time that it is consulted, and that always return the average price between one cunsultation and the previous. We could also set a minimum interval to make sure that the price is always strong enough and hard to manipulate.
The rationale behind having an official uniswap oracle is given by the implication that this kind of design would work really well when the price oracle is used a lot, that is when the price is consulted many times in a day. So why is it that every DeFi project that wanna use Uniswap's TWAP should design it's own version of an oracle? It would be much easier if all DeFi projects would converge and use the same oracle.

That's for sure an interesting way to build a price oracle around uniswap with the right incentives, however I think it has a few drawbacks.... if the incentives were to be not high enough in future then it wouldn't be updated anymore. Also the cost of keeping it updated will be pretty high, so this will limit a lot the number of pairs that can be added to it. And it require an active governance.
One thing that I like about UniswapV2 is its semplicity and ability to be fully operational without the need of an active governance or additional incentives. I think that an ""official uniswap oracle"" should be built with that same philosophy in mind.","",""

@michaelstone I also implemented the second version that we were discussing.
The second accept MIN_T as input. However there is a new constant, MIN_T_JUMP. The MIN_T passed as input must be less or equal that 4 * MIN_T_JUMP. Also, the price can be updated after at least MIN_T_JUMP from the previous update. 
For instance, if MIN_T_JUMP = 15 minutes than MIN_T could be anything less or equal than 1 hour.
Another advantage is that in the first version the price is updated at most every hour, instead in the second version at most every 15 minutes. This mean that the price will generally be fresher if a pair receives a lot of interaction.
The only disadvantage is that the second version costs more. An update on V1 costs 19677 and on V2 costs 32341.
13k gas is not a lot in absolute terms but that's still a 64% increase, so I don't know if it's really worth it....
The second version add more flexibility, but it doesn't guarantee that the price returned will be fresh.","",""

It wouldn't be very hard to add, mainly depends on your price selection method and trading off gas usage for more complex queries. E.g. you could pick the one with most active liquidity, harmonic mean between the three pools's active liquidity for a liquidity-weighted twap, etc.

But at the moment it doesn't seem very practical to spend the gas doing this, most assets don't have multiple fee pools and I suspect over time most liquidity will flow to only a single pool anyway.

Nope, it does because all pools have different liquidity in different ranges. The TWAP library developed by uniswap team, gets TWAP from a specific pool, not from a specific pair. 
This means that, let's say I hardcode my protocol to use 0.3% pool for a specific pair, I'll get the twap for that specific pool. Let's say all liquidity moves to the 0.05% pool of the same pair. And the 0.3% liquidity becomes out of range, or it's not getting consistent ticks. The TWAP of the 0.3% pool will not be accurate.

"829495717403295784","awbvious","08/06/2021 10:45 pm","FYI, it was KP3R--per the screenshot.  I wrote about the issue to the security uniswap email address, and got an answer on the problem from Hayden himself.  He said it was a problem of liquidity.  He said I had to make a small trade of ETH to KP3R of approximately $5 to make the price reflect correctly.  I tried, and I didn't see any ""insufficient liqudity, use v2"" error, so I assumed it would work via v3.   But my ""current price"" on my NFT didn't change.  I think it was because the current (true) price of KP3R was apparently too high for the range of my v3 token.  I figured it out because the amount of KP3R that I received for the ETH spent was indeed outside of my range.  In fact, I don't think there was any v3 0.3% liquidity with KP3R at that price, because there was no recent transactions in that info for that 0.3% pool.  However, there were recent transactions for the 1% v3 pool.  So I assume what happened was the trade went through, but used the 1% pool (which, by the way, on the info page showed the correct current price), as it had liquidity that was in the price range.  So, determined to get my ""current price"" to update, I created another v3 NFT that had a range that includes a higher price for KP3R.  Then I tried another v3 trade.   I got a warning about slippage or something, and that I'd have to do an Expert/custom trade.  It turned out to be a very expensive experiment, as now my $5 trade would cost $30 in fees.  But, after that trade, it finally used my other v3 NFT with the higher price range, and then the current price updated for both of them (I believe, both NFTs are showing more believable prices now).  I've spent probably over a hundred bucks in gas fees on these KP3R NFTS and I haven't made even a dollar in uniswap fees.  Good times.","",""

Will the getReserves() in uniswap v2 handle it? We have a ready solution using this so thats why we will probably use that. 

Looking at Uniswap whitepaper v2 it seems like they store the price for the last transaction In previous block or price before first transaction in current block. Doesn’t that mean that a flashloan that only work within one block shouldn’t be able to manipulate the price? 

The uniswap docs also seems to point into this direction and they write that the attacker needs to make a bad trade in the previous block. But that would be another issue I think and really not related to the flashloan.

We are familiar with V3's built-in moving average oracle. The problem we are facing rn is how to combine the MA prices from different pools.

We want to do a weighted average of the prices from these pools and use the pool's liquidity depth as the weight. But with V3's active liquidity design, we are a bit confused on how to determine the total (active) liquidity of a pool, or if there is any better parameter to represent a pool's depth","","🧠 (2),👍 (2)"

Hi devs, I'm working on using the UniswapV3 oracle and get a revert: `reverted with reason string 'OLD'`. I traced it back to here (I think): https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/05c10bf6d547d6121622ac51c457f93775e1df09/contracts/libraries/Oracle.sol#L226

Could someone help me understand what the cause of this reversion is? I'm having an issue understanding why this would revert. It was working all day for me testing against a target pool using mainnet forking on Polygon. It seems to be intermittent too because it started and then stopped working for a second time today.

Here's my getTWAP() function on my contract:
```
    function getTwap() public view returns (uint _price) {
        uint32 _twapDuration = 30; // TODO: Parameterize this
        uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
        secondsAgo[0] = _twapDuration;
        secondsAgo[1] = 0;

        (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = uniswapPool.observe(secondsAgo);
        uint sqrtRatioX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int(uint(_twapDuration))));
        _price = FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtRatioX96, sqrtRatioX96, FixedPoint96.Q96);

        // TODO: This section needs some work, I can't explain this math well enough
        // If the tickCumulatives are negative use alternative calculation:
        if(tickCumulatives[0] < 0 ) {
            _price = ((sqrtRatioX96 * 1e18 / (2 ** 96)) ** 2) / 1e18;
        } else {
            _price = 1e18 / (((sqrtRatioX96 * 1e18 / (2 ** 96)) ** 2) / 1e18);

"998858394297442309","0xandreistefan","14/06/2023 5:49 pm","Hi! At Solid World, we have recently deployed a pool on the Polygon mainnet with the contract address `0xc6832Ef0af793336aa44a936E54b992BfF47e7Cd`. Our users utilize the Gamma protocol to deploy liquidity to this pool, and benefit from tokenized LP positions.

I am reaching out to seek your assistance in understanding error code ""OLD we have encountered. After debugging, we have determined that the issue arises when the Gamma protocol performs certain checks, and calls `pool.observe(secondsAgos)`. The current value of secondsAgos is set as [120, 0]. Strangely, this function sometimes reverts with the ""OLD"" error, while at other times it executes successfully. Furthermore, we have noticed that if users retry the same operations after a few minutes, the ""OLD"" error no longer occurs.

Based on our analysis of the code, it seems that observations are added during swaps and liquidity deposits on the pool. However, it appears that the pool's number of observations is insufficient, leading to the occurrence of the ""OLD"" error. We have also reached out to the Gamma protocol team, and according to their experience, this error happens randomly for certain pools, irrespective of transaction volume.

In an attempt to reproduce the issue, I conducted a simulation by calling the problematic function (which, in turn, calls `pool.observe(secondsAgos)`) within a Polygon mainnet fork using Anvil. Interestingly, during my simulation, the ""OLD"" error did not occur on the first attempt. However, when I repeated the simulation after approximately 19 blocks, the error manifested.

Understanding the root cause of this issue has proven to be challenging due to its unpredictable nature. Therefore, we kindly request your assistance in comprehending the source cause of this error and guiding us in the right direction for its resolution.

We look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you!","",""

I am trying to get a TWAP price feed in the test I am running. One part of the includes calling observe where one of the values passed in is 0 (so current block)...when I pass in anywhere from 0-40 seconds, it seems to work fine...when I pass in 50 seconds I noticed a huge price change...so I looked at what was being passed back from slot0 index and tick…
both values were same (as should be expected) for both tests…
hence same observation array member and same tick should be used to create current accumulator, and since blocknumber are also the same, this should result in the same value for the accumulator at time 0 seconds ago… but they differ!
What am I missing here?

```
60 second interval, values when t=0 passed
tick:  202040
lastIndex:  206
tickCumulative: 11215147971019

40 second interval, values when t=0 passed
tick:  202040
lastIndex:  206
tickCumulative: 11215148173059
```

why are the tick cumulative values from observeSingle when secondsAgo =0 different when block timestamps, tick value and last index are the same?

Thanks!","",""

Thank you Austin for response!
But why would the value at 0 seconds ago change? In observeSingle function that is a special case and just linearly scales tick*timeElapsed + mostRecentTickCumulative…
It should never interpolate, right? (The other time value, yeah I agree that can vary and also with interpolation could have different observation values from the Observations array, but the ones at time = 0 seconds ago with same index, same tick and same blockNumber should always give same value across all the tests, right?)","",""

since i've not done, this is just a guess on the whole pool math, nothing to verify with afaik

R == rate of tokens per second
L == in range LQ
𝑠𝑝𝑙  = secondsPerLiquidityCumulative
t0 & t1   are likely the time period range of secondsPerLiquidityCumulative


for the positions you would likely need this from snapshot cumulative
`tickCumulativeInside int56, secondsPerLiquidityInsideX128 uint160, secondsInside uint32`

and this from the ticks
`liquidityNet int128, tickCumulativeOutside int56, secondsPerLiquidityOutsideX128 uint160, secondsOutside uint32`
I assume the math would be similar to the fee math.
