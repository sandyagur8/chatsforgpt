"261535993515999233","maciektr","11/04/2023 1:00 pm","Hi @eni! 

You need to add path of the directory containing your subcommand binary (named `scarb-{my_cli_tool}` on unix based systems and `scarb-{my_cli_tool}.exe` on windows) to the PATH environmental variable. 

You can read a quick introduction to PATH variable here: https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/cs348/www-S08/unix_path.html 

To manage the PATH variable on windows, please follow this tutorial: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm

Alternatively, you can put the binary file in `bin` folder inside scarb's local data directory, as pointed in the docs here: https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/docs/reference/global-directories#local-data-directory
(So it would be e.g.  `$HOME/.local/share/scarb/bin/scarb-{my_cli_tool}` on Linux)

Please make sure your binary is executable, i.e. has execution permissions set on unix based systems (`chmod +x scarb-{my_cli_tool}`) .

Let me know if this helps!","",""

i know scarb doesn't yet have a cairo test runner, but I was wondering if there's any workaround for running `cairo-test` in a project that contains scarb dependencies?
it seems `cairo-test` tries to recompile the project and fails to do so because it doesn't pull in the deps...

If I modify the ERC20 example by adding a line using the `upcast` function, and then place it in my project directory, I get the SIerra file by running `scarb build`. However, declaring the JSON file on starknet-devnet locally fails. The error message is the same as when I run `starknet-compile` on the ERC20 and there is no JSON output.

However, if I run `starknet-compile --allowed-libfuncs-list-name experimental_v0.1.0` on the ERC20, I can successfully declare the JSON file on starknet-devnet locally. 

Does that mean that `scarb build` does not set the` --allowed-libfuncs-list-name` flag? I am also confused why compilation via Scarb successfully generates a Sierra JSON file when it would otherwise fail via `starknet-compile`.","",""

Here is the native way doing it with built-ins from cairo compiler (running `scarb test`):

```rust
use core::traits::Into;
use core::result::ResultTrait;
use array::ArrayTrait;
use option::OptionTrait;
use traits::TryInto;

use super::IYourContractDispatcher;
use super::IYourContractDispatcherTrait;

        0,
        constructor_calldata.span(),
        false
    ).unwrap();

    let c = IYourContractDispatcher { contract_address: depoyed_address };

More specifically - I am currently able to unit test my `#[external]` functions easily doing something like this:
```
#[test]
#[available_gas(9999999)]
#[should_panic(expected: ('AuthorityMismatchError', ))]
fn bad_set_authority() {
    // Initialize the contract with an authority.
    MyContract::constructor(util::toContractAddress('Jack'));

    // Try to set a new authority (from a caller address who is not the authority).
    let bad_authority = util::toContractAddress('NotJack');
    testing::set_caller_address(bad_authority);
    MyContract::set_authority(bad_authority);
}
```

With the updated Cairo 2.0.x syntax - my `set_authority` function stub would look something like this:
```
fn set_authority(ref self: ContractState, authority: ContractAddress);
```
So my current test suite breaks because I cant pass in `ContractState`. I've read a couple resources referencing Protostar integration testing - but it sounds like support for Cairo 2.0.x wont be launched there
- https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/cairo-1/testing/integration-testing
- https://medium.com/starknet-edu/testing-a-cairo-1-smart-contract-with-protostar-c2ea095037fc

‚úèÔ∏è*Edit*: I haven't missed the announcements from the swmansion team about a new test runner launching in the near future. If you think that this new test runner will handle this case more easily, I am happy to continue with cairo 1.1.1 until then as well!","",""

First of all, thank you for providing such an amazing application to Cairo developers!

Now to my question / problem. I have a huge smart contract. It's file size is about 6.8 MB and contains +62k lines of code. It basically contains an image converted to a felt252 array.

When I try to compile it using `scarb build` the process runs for some minutes and uses about 1GB of RAM on my MacBook. However, at a certain point of time the scarb process starts to consume ridiculous amounts of RAM and swap. It seems to increase gradually until the process is being killed by the operation system. At that point it uses nearly 200GB of memory. I found the following log message in system logs:

```
low swap: killing largest compressed process with pid 2445 (scarb) and size 194568 MB
```

I guess it is happening as soon as compilation is done and the sierra code is written to the disk. Any idea why that is?

```
scarb 0.5.1 (798acce7f 2023-07-05)
cairo: 2.0.1 (https://crates.io/crates/cairo-lang-compiler/2.0.1)
```

I know this is an extreme edge case since cairo files are much smaller in general.

PS: Building the contract works when I decrease its size to about 50k Lines of code. With such a file scarb uses about 120GB of memory.","",""
