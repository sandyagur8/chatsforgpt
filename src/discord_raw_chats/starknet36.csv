We're focused on building better trading and minting primitives for NFTs on L2 (think everything from L2 ERC721 to a DEX, AMM and auction system). We're hiring engineers to use CAIRO to extend our platform - please send me a DM if you're keen to learn and build. We're open to engineers of all levels of seniority. You don't have to be an expert right now, just super motivated to become one 😉 

We're Australia-based, and we have a soft preference for local candidates, but anyone is welcome to apply and we have a global team already 🙂 

We're also hiring in product, sales, marketing and just about everything else - come and help us make sure the future of NFTs is on Ethereum, not on <insert terrible alternative L1>. DMs always open.","","🔥 (30),👍 (15),😎 (5),😱 (4),👀 (1)"

Fabien from Snapshot Labs here, we are building a voting framework and interface at https://snapshot.org to help DAOs take decisions, one of the most used tool for DAOs. We are looking for Cairo developers to join our team or contribute. Currently working on StarkVote in collaboration with StarkWare, StarkVote is a solution that leverage StarkNet to index votes cast on Snapshot and settle results on L1, this will bring crypto governance to some unprecedent level of efficiency and security and we believe will become the standard for voting. Here is a recent video intro to learn more about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOvKft5uOTc&t=7590s. We are a small team working remotely, Snapshot is well funded and made as a public good, free to use and fully open source with MIT license. Contact me in PM if you want to learn more 🙂","","🔥 (11)"

Towards the Launch of StarkNet, more exciting projects are popping up, and this time - with **Chainlink**!

StarkWare and Chainlink intend to bring Chainlink's oracle services to StarkNet, and we are establishing a competent team that would make this happen. The team members will be paid monthly as external consultants. 

**As a team member, you will:**
* Work closely and intimately with StarkWare and Chainlink developers and have the opportunity to learn firsthand about StarkNet and Chainlink systems.
* Think and design how Chainlink's oracles logic would look like in the StarkNet environment, without all these gas considerations/optimizations made on L1
* Get to influence first-hand on the roadmap of StarkNet (as we will prioritize core features required for this effort)
* Witness how a lot of exciting projects that depend on Oracles use the very code you write.

**The ideal team member has:**
* Experience with StarkNet and Cairo frameworks
* Enthusiastic about proof system and oracles
* Knowledge about the current Chainlink's L1 logic
* At least three years of development experience
* Excellent communication skills

My last role was COO at a consumer startup, and in the past I worked at hedge funds investing in tech. I am currently working with industry leaders on a DAO to shape crypto regulations through lobbying and community organizing.

Looking at your team, I noticed StarkWare don’t have anyone in an operations role. I excel at building operational processes that enable businesses to scale effectively, which frees up the bandwidth of senior leaders so they can focus on the highest value areas. In short, I can make headaches go away. I could also have a big impact in corporate development, strategy, policy & compliance, and in dealing with investors. 

I would love to have a conversation.","","👍🏽 (2)"

It's really great to have you on board. Cairo is not that hard to learn and a promising skill in your toolbox. This tutorial will show you how to write and implement a StarkNet contract: 

https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html 

and https://starknet.io/recorded-tutorials/ 

Henri's new tutorial has just started, it's pretty easy to follow and you can earn some juicy points: https://discord.com/channels/793094838509764618/853954510515208192/930835511734595595

Cairo was specifically designed to be efficient within STARK, which is the cryptography that Starknet uses to make computations cheap. You can read more about Cairo here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/ and https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/

We are a Georgia based fully staffed team that contributed to dozens of projects since early testnets and would be happy to provide more value for the StarkNet. We work with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Solana, The Graph, Cosmos, Polkadot, Akash, XXnetwork and many other layer 0, 1, 2 platforms.
We understand quite well the architecture of infrastructure based on various setups and different use cases. Extensive experience in web3 development including DEXes, marketplaces, messengers, dashboards and various types of integrations between products and services in CeFi and DeFi.

99% of the faucets are created in the simplest way and do not solve an important problem - the problems of spam and abuse to get a large number of tokens. Dozens of incentivized testnets fell into this trap and allowed multi-accounts to receive a huge number of rewards, which hurts the project's economy after the mainnet launch.

We developed a faucet that helps to prevent the problem of spam and helps of fair distribution.

MVP 
Advanced Testnet Faucet.

Our faucet authorizes the user through discord and according to the user's discord roles (validator, early tester, admin) we can specify some advanced rules for tokens distribution to each user, such as total limit of tokens, frequency of distribution and additional features, for example authorization through other social networks i.e. Telegram.

Faucet Benefits:
- Reducing the possibility of malicious activity through abusive and spam attacks
- More equitable distribution of tokens via the faucet
- Flexible system of rights, issuance and limits, setup and filtering of incoming requests

If you are interested I can send you link to the MVP as well as detailed doc.","",""

I am a creative, time punctual, dedicated, goal-oriented individual with decent moral Values and Ethicates along with a high-energy level, honed communication skills, strong organizational skills, and meticulous attention to detail.

I have strong experience in Full Stack and Blockchain Development focusing on developing functional, beautiful, dynamic Websites especially web3 dApps in crypto space.
My major strength in Frontend Development is React and Vue.js - deep understandings in functional component and class component, lifecycles and hooks and can combine them efficiently.
Regarding the Backend, I love Node.js.
I've developed many websites using MERN stack, Vue.js and Laravel, and created many bots and apis using Django REST framework and python language.
I also have decent experience with solidity smart contract development on EVM compatible networks.
I always keep clean, tidy, easily readable, and maintainable code for delivery and this always helped me to succeed in every job.

We already achieved quite a lot of work around the NFT collections (which are already designed), protocols for the future of ''Sponzi'', web and marketing strategies.

I am thrilled to apply for the position of Community Leader for the Portuguese members of your cryptocurrency project. As a native speaker of Portuguese, Spanish, and English, I am confident that I have the language skills to effectively communicate with and lead the Portuguese community.
