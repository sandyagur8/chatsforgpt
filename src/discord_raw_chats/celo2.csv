Avoid running into errors while launching Celo-composer
1. Navigate to `packages/hardhat` directory
2. Install _node_modules_  with `yarn install`
3. Visit `hardhat.config.js` file and do two things
i. Comment out `require(""@typechain/hardhat"");`
ii. Comment out `typechain` object provided in `module.exports` object

⚠️ Do this before doing anything else

Looks like the version of NPM I used was the problems. The recent npm version is a blast. I use nvm for installing the version of npm I need. Had to uninstall all of the versions of npm using `nvm uninstall <version>`. Uninstall nvm itself from the control panel. Then I install npm using the installer package from the official website, and viola, I have Celo composer running.","",""
