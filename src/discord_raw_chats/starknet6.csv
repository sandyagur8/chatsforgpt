Assuming you are using this already, and you are facing an issue at compilation time, this is probably because the test-runner crate from the compiler doesn't (currently) use scarb modules resolution, and if you are using external contracts leveraging scarb (nile compile does this), the test-runner is not able to compile those, because it can't find the external artifacts. If you are not using external modules you should be fine though. We plan to integrate the test-runner on nile through a test command, and then we will work on this, but keep in mind that is a compatibility issue between scarb compilation and test-runner compilation mechanisms.","","‚úÖ (4)"
