Today we release our open source StarkNet wallet browser extension as a developers preview! 🎉 🔥 

https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x

Chrome Web Store review is still pending, and we'll add an easy way to install the extension as soon as it gets approved, but you can start buidl today! It uses the known Provider and Signer API which was first introduced by starknet.js. There's also an example DApp deployed where you can put the wallet to the test, as soon as you got it running! 

Have fun creating awesome things during the weekend, and feel free to provide feedback!","","🔥 (15),🚀 (9),🥳 (5)"

According to my understanding, argent-x will deploy a contract on the user's behalf and all the requests will be going to that contract and it will redirect request to final contract address. In the case of `voting_contract`, there are functions like `init_poll`, which does not take `r` and `s` values, also there are functions like `register_voter`, which takes `r` and `s` values. From a front end perspective, how do we send requests to call these 2 functions? Do we need to pass `r` and `s` values from the js file (for 'register_voter' function) or will argent-x takes care of it?","",""
"394110674109988864","ironsoul#6439","01/12/2021 1:14 pm","Adding to this question, we saw that Argent X passes r, s signatures to `execute` function of the contract.

"570249468054732800","julien.argent.xyz","01/12/2021 2:07 pm","I'm not completely sure what you are trying to achieve. Do you have a link to a contract I could look at? 

But it is true that Argent X deploys an Account Contract for the user, and every ""write"" action (a transaction that modifies the state of a contract) must start from the `execute`. method of that account. To be valid, the transaction must include a signature (the `r` and `s` value) from the private key authorised on that Account Contract and Argent X can generate that signature because it manages the private key for the user. The call to  `execute`. also includes the parameters of the call that must e executed by the Account Contract (the target contract, the target method and the parameters). 

When the Account Contract calls another contract, the target contract can use `get_caller_address()` to get the address of the Account and has the guarantee that it was authorised by the owner of the Account since it went through the `execute` method that included signatures.

However, Argent X will soon be able to also generate signatures on an off-chain message (coming next week). For example maybe your contract needs a signature on the string ""hello world"". In that case your dapp will require Argent X to sign that string, then require Argent X to send a transaction to your contract including this extra signature in the parameters of your method. You contract can then verify the signature by getting the address of the Account with `get_caller_address()` then verifying the extra signature by calling `is_valid_signature`. on the account.

Hope that helps.","",""

As you can see there, some functions require `r` and `s` as arguments. Based on what you said, these values are not passed automatically by Argent X and the functionality to generate signatures for this function will come next week?

- Every user will  need an Account contract on StarkNet so this is not related to Argent specifically.
- The address of an account can be created counterfactually (without having to deploy the account), and the account can be deployed at that address later. Since you always need funds to do something on chain, you can imagine a pattern where the users installs Argent X and creates an account. The wallet shows the address but the account is not yet deployed (no cost). However, to the user it doesn't matter; he has an account with an address. He can use that address to get some fund.

Assuming the sequencer response / transaction effect is not instant (which will probably always be the case), I think that this is an issue. A single app can handle it by simply waiting for the first transaction to end (not nice, but doable). 
But, think of a scenario where the user is interacting with 2 applications - one right after the other.  The user is doing a transaction with App1 and right after (within a couple of minutes) goes and do a transaction with App2 ---> the App2 transaction will fail and App2 will have no way to prevent this...","",""

this channel is for Argent X issues/improvements **only**. 
Let us know if you have any issues using it or integrating it into the DApps you are building, or if you want to share any information around it (Argent X, DApp ecosystem or starknet.js related)

If you're looking to get test tokens, **you can mint them yourself** using the Argent X UI or our test DApp https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-x#-example-dapp
If you want to request tokens anyways, or sent some to somebody **(they are worthless, and always will be)** go to #📺｜community-calls 

Smalltalk and gm/gn can be done in #🕗｜gm-gn and the other Community channels, please keep the other channels clean for the builders, bugs and improvements, so they do not need to scroll through the whole channel to find the informations valuable to them and the product they're building

Thanks all!","",""

1) On the Select Backup screen, I can't drag & drop the json file (clicking on the file explorer makes the Argent X wallet hide itself) so I have to use the 'click to select' method
2) When I select the json file, instead of returning me to the Select Backup screen so that I can click the Restore from Backup button, the screen flashes and the Argent X wallet vanishes
3) Then when I click on the Argent X extension it opens at the Get Started screen.

Main issues right now:
1. **Deployment**: It seems like the deployment of wallets is stuck. This is due to how we refresh the data. A wallets deployment status only gets updated if that wallet is selected (you can see the token balances of that wallet) **and** after you waited for >60 seconds. We're currently working to put all transaction tracking into the background process making this much more reliable.
2. **Password issue**: It seems like a few of you get stuck when entering the correct password. While the concrete issue here is still unknown, it's most likely that it's some messed up internal state. For now you should try to reset your extension and try to create a new wallet with a new password (dont use the backup file)","","StarkNet (3)"

The pubkey for my account is listed as:  0x6f8b21c8354e8ba21ead656932eaa21e728f8c81f001488c186a336d7038cf1

However I manually called the signMessage the same way the wallet does with my backup json:
```
  const jason = JSON.stringify(dummy);
  const wal = await ethers.Wallet.fromEncryptedJson(jason, 'PWD');
  const starkPair = getKeyPair(wal.privateKey);
  const pubKey = `0x${starkPair.getPublic().getX().toString('hex')}`;
  const pubKeyY = `0x${starkPair.getPublic().getY().toString('hex')}`;

  const walPub = '0x6f8b21c8354e8ba21ead656932eaa21e728f8c81f001488c186a336d7038cf1';

  const hash = getMessageHash(typedDataExample, walPub);

  const [r, s] = sign(starkPair, hash);

  console.log('VERIFY: ', verify(starkPair, hash, [r, s]));
```

And the pubkey that is printed out from the KeyPair used to sign and verify is actually: 0x4e52f2f40700e9cdd0f386c31a1f160d0f310504fc508a1051b747a26070d10

than I'm running the starknet_devnet python server ('sudo python3 starknet-devnet/starknet_devnet/server.py') -> this listens on port 443

I am working on a starknet project where most user interaction happens through a chrome extension that injects content scripts onto a web page.

I'd like to leverage argent-x for the starknet.js instance and providers it injects and avoid replicating all of that to interact with starknet. However, this is not possible right now due to the browser sandboxing everything injected by chrome extensions so there is no direct communication with argent-x. 

I found that metamask had the same issue in the past and it seems to have a ?simple? solution. I was wondering if this can be done for argent-x?

If this is something that can't be prioritized I'd be happy to look into it myself!

Thanks!

"570249468054732800","julien.argent.xyz","07/02/2022 1:55 pm","That's a great question and the answer depends on how Starkware will implement fees in StarkNet. Fees are not yet implemented. Note also that your questions applies to all wallets since StarkNet implements account abstraction (i.e. all accounts are contracts), so it is not only related to Argent X. 

One possible solution is to use CREATE2 which means that you can know the address of a contract before deploying it. So you can imagine the user counterfactually creating an account (in practice only determining the future address). But from the UX point of view it is as if the account is created. Before doing an action with that account (e.g. minting an NFT) the user needs to fund it. Once the account is funded you can now deploy the contract and pay the fees which can be bundled with the first action.","",""

2. The default allowance is 0
3. In Cairo the max allowance is probably the maximum number that fits in a `felt` 
4. That's a great feature and it will definitely be in Argent X at some point, but it's not the case currently

This being said, infinite approvals is a terrible idea from a security point of view (you're basically allowing the spender to take all your tokens... and the spender may well be a proxy with a different implementation in the future). At Argent we've been pushing the ecosystem to move away from it for years.

The great news is that StarkNet supports multicalls by default, so in a single transaction you can `approve` and `call` . If your dapp needs to take `X` tokens, you can do a multicall that approves `X` then call your dapp in a single transaction.","","🔥 (1),🙌🏼 (1)"

Voyager (and Argent X v3) is using the latest version of `starknet.js`. while Argent X v2 is using an older version with a breaking change in the Provider. 

I think some people tried 2 approaches to transfer (non ERC20) assets from Argent X v2 to v3. One is to extract the signer of your accounts and transfer the assets with a script.

Additionally you can now add/edit/remove custom networks as a last minute feature, which got requested by the StarkWare team in the context of the Hackaton!

I feel like I'm really close to getting it working but I can't seem to get the keys that correspond to my first argent account. How do I do this? I've tried the following:

I extracted my private key from the keystore using ethers `pk = await Wallet.fromEncryptedJson(backupFileJSON, password)` and then generated the key pair using `ec.getKeyPair(pk)` from the starknet.js lib
unfortunately the public key doesn't match the one that I see if I call `get_signer()` on my account contract.

I then tried using the mnemonic and using ethers `Wallet.fromMnemonic` to get at the signer. This gives me the same key pair as above.

I thought that perhaps to get at my first set of Argent account keys I'd need to use the derivationPath specified in the argent backup file

`Wallet.fromMnemonic(selectedNetwork.l2.mnemonic, ""m/2645'/1195502025'/1148870696'/0'/0'/0"");`

This yields a different key pair but not the one that matches my first argent account.
Feels like I'm missing one tiny thing but I'm not sure what I need to do. I thought that maybe I was using an incorrect EC but I'm using `ec` from starknet.js so that should be the right curve?","",""

So I have figured out that, if you try to make a transaction on xbank for example and the gas fee is not fully calculated in the argent wallet, it is still possible to sign the transaction, but it will not be sent. But if you repeat the process and wait for the gas fee price accordingly, then the transaction is sent.

It would be good if it could be considered that that signing is only possible when the gas fee is finally calculated. As it is with MetaMask, there it is only possible to confirm a transaction if the gas fee is calculated.  Please let me know your thoughts.","",""

No bid deal for me. I can simply wipe out the wallet. I'm yet curious to know if there is a way to resync the nonce.

Remember that on StarkNet we have account abstraction so a private key is not directly linked to an account (which is a contract). So importing a key alone will not do much; you would need to import a key and the account associated.

But we are working on a standard to make these kind of things easier on StarkNet https://community.starknet.io/t/account-keys-and-addresses-derivation-standard/1230","","👍 (1)"

StarkNet released v0.9 with braking changes on testnet. So you only need to create new accounts and migrate your assets on testnet.

2) Also, in the `voyager` isn't it possible to see the incoming transactions? (e.g.: If I send ETH from addressA to addressB. This transaction doesn't show up in addressB, so addressB doesn't know where the funds come from).

Thanks in advance.","",""

"819494548349648906","tuya#9656","14/06/2022 8:53 pm","**Q1: What is the difference between Argent X and Argent mobile APP?**
Argent X is a wallet deployed on StarkNet
Argent mobile APP is a wallet deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and zkSync.

**Q2: Can the mnemonic of MetaMask be used to create an Argent X wallet?**
While possible, we discourage it. 
You should try to keep different wallets separate and secure. So we recommend you to create a new Argent X wallet

**Q3: Can the addresses of Argent X and MetaMask be transferred to each other?**
No they can't. Accounts on StarkNet are smart-contracts so their address is computed differently then on Ethereum. If you send funds to a MetaMask address on StarkNet your funds will be lost.

**Q4: Where to get eth faucet?**
L1 goerli for Ethereum
https://goerlifaucet.com/
https://faucets.chain.link/goerli
L2 goerli for StarkNet
https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/#
if L2 cant work, you can also use starkgate to transfer L1 eth to L2.
https://goerli.starkgate.starknet.io/

**Q5,: where can I find the installation package of the previous version of Argent X?**

---------------------------------
**Q1. Wallet is not deployed: **
it will be fixed in 4.1.2 in several hours.

**Q2. Can't migrate funds: **
Also will be resolved in 4.1.2

**Q3. Will I lose my starknet mainnet funds? **
No.

**Q4. Will I lose my transaction history?**
Yes, as you will need to use a new wallet

**Q5. Why is it happening?**
StarkNet mainnet has gotten an update that will make old contracts (and therefore wallets) obsolete, it is a good thing as it means StarkNet is developing.

**Q6. Is there a deadline for the migration?**
Migration will be available for a couple weeks at least, please stay tuned for more accurate deadline.

**Q7. I have no ETH, only other assets in mainnet wallet: **
You will need to deposit some ETH through Starkgate or from another starknet wallet to your old address to send assets.","",""

@here

We're super excited for our latest release. It includes 2 huge improvements in UX: Fiat values and Transaction review with risk assessment.

Fiat values: Now on Argent X, when on Mainnet, you can see the equivalent value in dollars.

Transaction review and Risk assessment: Right before signing a transaction, you'll get comprehensive details about what it's actually doing. 
For certain transactions, Argent X will display a message with a risk assessment message, letting the user know about potential scams and also verified transactions trusted by Argent. 


Learn more about it and our future announcements on twitter:
https://twitter.com/argentHQ/status/1549380860524302339?s=20&t=b5KKAzBYFqiqnhEbQ58ByQ

https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/develop/Blocks/transaction-life-cycle/
Methods you can try when it comes to Rejected:
1. Check if your StarkNet wallet(Argent x or Braavos) is upgraded to the latest version.
2. Restart your browser and keep trying. If it's a withdrawal or transfer on StarkNet, pls check if your wallet has sufficient balance, or pls try a small withdraw first, and you can increase (edit) gas fee on the review page (Currently seems only available on Braavos wallet). 
3. If you have VPN enabled, try switching to another node; If you are using VPS, pls try on other computers 
Finally, it'd be so helpful if you can share the Rejected tx for us to investigate, thank you very much!

1. Created a Seed Phrase in Argent X
2. Imported that Seed Phrase into Braavos
3. Added new wallet to the seed phrase in Braavos (and put money into it and used it)
4. Initiated a withdrawal from Starknet to ETH mainnet
5. Resetted the wallet in Braavos
6. Then imported the same Seed again but the wallet from the step 3 didnt appear. Neither in Braavos nor in Agrent X.


The issue is: I can't access the given wallet and finish the withdrwal from Starknet. How can I access it again?

Today we’re releasing a big update for Argent X: the only audited, verified and open source wallet on StarkNet

In this update, we’re introducing major changes:

    ●   **For new accounts there will be a one time activation fee only on the first transaction. Argent doesn’t receive any of these fees,** as they’re used to pay for deployment in the network. To learn more visit StarkNet’s updates channel: https://discord.gg/qypnmzkhbc
    ●  **Support for the latest StarkNet accounts.** Your accounts need to be upgraded to support StarkNet 0.10 and beyond.
    ●  **Nice UI updates. ** We’re introducing changes in the UI regarding settings, accounts and basic navigation
    ●  Many bug fixes and improvements 🐞  🔫

Learn more about it and our future announcements on twitter:

> Testnet and mainnet addresses in your wallets are different. It is normal to have different addresses on testnet and mainnet, it would mean you have created them at different times - with different contracts and different implementation. You need to contact the dapp that requires similar addresses and ask them to make it possible otherwise.

Also here are two solutions from the argent x community about this issue, pls check it:
On issues during the upgrade. 
Issue 1.
If you are seeing an error Error message: implementation invalid - you are trying to upgrade a deprecated wallet. You will need to create a new one. 
You can use our CLI tool to send the assets from the old wallet to the new one. If you are using mac, there is a video with the steps from our developers: https://www.loom.com/share/668e72c4729d4da5b46841383cf569c6
and here you can find a guide for Windows: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fs-X7xjHsb7yD2jZB8qkHCeteClufjHd/view?usp=sharing
You can't keep the old address as it was never upgraded and is now deprecated, but using the instruction above you can move the assets you have in the wallet.
Note: If the CLI tool is crashing, please DM me when it does so, we are looking into this. 

Issue 2. 
If you are seeing 
```Error message: Proxy: caller is not admin
Error at pc=0:302:
An ASSERT_EQ instruction failed: 0 !=  ```

This means that you likely recovered your Argent wallet in another StarkNet wallet (e.g. Braavos), and this would have changed the contract. We are working on a fix and thank you for your patience. In the meantime, a workaround would be to either use that other wallet, or create a new Argent wallet and send the assets from the old one to the new address. If you can't use the wallet in another extension, please reach out to their support team for help. 

thank you","",""

> You can use our CLI tool to send the assets from the old wallet to the new one. If you are using mac, there is a video with the steps from our developers: https://www.loom.com/share/668e72c4729d4da5b46841383cf569c6

> You can't keep the old address as it was never upgraded and is now deprecated, but using the instruction above you can move the assets you have in the wallet.
> Note: If the CLI tool is crashing, please DM me when it does so, we are looking into this.

Unfortunately, we will not implement the private key option in order to recover your account, I'm afraid. Only seed phrase or social recovery methods are currently in development.

Our developers built a CLI tool on transferring the assets. You can't recover the wallet via private key, you can only recover the funds in it and send them to a new address.

ETH addres : 0xa7cB801Fc29D928ABe20bB1cCAdc821b55DD047D

Problem : i try bridged about 0.0105 ETH from Starknet to Arbitrum about two month ago, but haven't got those fund in my ETH Arbitrum wallet.
Note : I waited for it but it didn't come in, then I let it go until now because the assets are not that big but if I have bigger assets and get this bridge problem back I don't know what to do.


Wallet used: MetaMask and Argent-X 
Browser used: Chrome


Orbiter MOD said : there is not a transaction generated using Orbiter, so they suggest to ask Straknet's Argent Discord .
 
I hope this problem can be resolved, it's better if my assets come back and and I can return to using wallet argent comfortably, thank you.

I have 2 browsers.  Opera and Chrome

I had Argent wallet installed on Opera but I don't think I upgraded my account on there (Seed phrases for both browsers are the same)

I upgraded my account on chrome wallet (again, same seed phrase)

I accidentaly sent 0.1 ETH to the account Address on Opera. It had a different address than the Chrome one even though the seed phrases are the same. Anyways, It says me to upgrade my wallet on opera, when i click to upgrade it, it gives instantly transaction is going to fail error. I can't upgrade the wallet on opera.  I can't send those funds to anywhere because it gives that error.

The both browsers uses the same wallet, they have the same seed phrase. When I tried to recover the account on a different Brave browser, it opened the upgraded version like the chrome. I can only see the funds on the opera wallet. Their Addresses are different.

How am i going to get back my funds?","",""
