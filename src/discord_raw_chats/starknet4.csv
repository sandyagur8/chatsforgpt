If you run `npm install`, you get the 3.19 (19 > 18 > 10) and not 3.18... if you do that, your package will be broken. My understanding is you don't bundle it in your npmjs artefact so good but still. A quick fix is to lock starknet.js to 3.18 in your package.json for now.","","üöÄ (1)"

1) In node_modules/@starknet-react/core/dist/network.js: added new `constants_1.StarknetChainId.TESTNET2` at https://goerli-2.voyager.online
2) In node_modules/starknet/constants.js: added new `StarknetChainId[""TESTNET2""] = ""0x534e5f474f45524c4932"";`
3) In node_modules/starknet/constants.d.ts: added new `TESTNET2 = ""0x534e5f474f45524c4932"";`

Any suggestions? Thanks!","",""

```
(function (StarknetChainId) {
    StarknetChainId[""MAINNET""] = ""0x534e5f4d41494e"";
    StarknetChainId[""TESTNET""] = ""0x534e5f474f45524c49"";

As background, after many tries to deploy an account to testnet2, I had to use  SN_GOERLI2 (534e5f474f45524c4932) which worked:
`starknet deploy_account --gateway_url https://alpha4-2.starknet.io/ --account=acct_testnet_2 --chain_id 534e5f474f45524c4932`

`starknet deploy --class_hash 0x1c58fbebfe39452aa4cfab8da48f037324e57a886f5a6cf1c470906ef6d524c --gateway_url https://alpha4-2.starknet.io/ --feeder_gateway_url https://alpha4-2.starknet.io/ --account=acct_testnet_2`

1) Install pre-release version (develop branch) of starknet.js which includes the updates for testnet2: $ yarn install starknet@next
2) In node_modules/@starknet-react/core/src/network.ts, inside `const KNOWN_CHAINS:` add this:
```
    [StarknetChainId.TESTNET2]: {
        id: StarknetChainId.TESTNET2,

            url: 'https://goerli-2.voyager.online',

3)    In your _app.tsx add this line:
```
const provider = new SequencerProvider({ network: ""goerli-alpha-2"" })

and change `<StarknetConfig>` to `<StarknetConfig defaultProvider={provider}>`

I have some troubles trying approving spending of 1 ETH. My app use starknet react and starknet js.
First I try passe :

But Argent said there is an Assertion error.
Then I try this:
let billion = parseFloat(""1000000000"")
let temp = toBN(Math.floor( add_collateral_amount*billion ))
let coll_amount = toBN(temp) * toBN(billion)
const tx = {
    contractAddress: eth_address,
    entrypoint: 'approve',

}
But it send exactly the same to Argent and then the same error occures.
Then I try:
let billion = parseFloat(""1000000000"")
