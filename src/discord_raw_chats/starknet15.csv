https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/releases/tag/v0.2.4
- Fixed deployment done with the `deploy` syscall.
- Added an endpoint for loading dumped Devnet instances: `/load`: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet#dumping.
- Updated the OpenZeppelin implementation used by predeployed accounts.
- Added support for JSON-RPC calls: https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet#json-rpc-api.
- Redeploying the same contract with the same salt is reintroduced (it was removed, but shouldn't have been as this is a feature of alpha-goerli).
- The `crypto-cpp-py` dependency was updated to have wheels for more macos versions.","","🔥 (4)"

https://github.com/orgs/Shard-Labs/projects/1/views/1

- `--lite-mode` only affects block hash calculation (uses numbering instead of actual hash)

https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/releases/tag/v0.4.0
- Introduce forking ([docs](https://shard-labs.github.io/starknet-devnet/docs/guide/fork )):
  - `starknet-devnet --fork-network <NAME|URL> --fork-block <NUMBER>`
  - The fork uses testnet ID for all networks (should be configurable in the future)
- Internal contracts now at the same addresses as on mainnet/testnet:
  - UDC: `0x41a78e741e5af2fec34b695679bc6891742439f7afb8484ecd7766661ad02bf`
  - Fee token contract: `0x49d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7`
  -  **Breaking change**
- Lite mode no longer uses sequential deployment tx hashing
  - Performed slower deployment than regular mode
  - Suggestion: reconsider if your use-case benefits from lite mode
- Fix missing L2 to L1 messages
- Fix state dumping on exit
- JSON-RPC:
  - Support v0.2.1
  - Fee estimation for declare txs
  - `getEvents`: fix continuation token when no events","","👀 (3),👏 (2),🎆 (2)"

- Introduced `blocks-on-demand`
    - https://shard-labs.github.io/starknet-devnet/docs/guide/blocks#create-a-block-on-demand
    - If you start Devnet with `--blocks-on-demand`, new txs are stored in a pending block
    - `POST /create_block_on_demand`
        - Turns pending block to latest
        - Starts a new pending block
        - Latest block contains all transactions since last block creation
    - Target block can be selected via block IDs `pending` and `latest`
        - Old blocks not queryable, but should be in the future
    - Old behavior (new block on each tx) unchanged and still default
- JSON-RPC request and response validation
    - Togglable with `--disable-rpc-request-validation` and `--disable-rpc-response-validation`
- JSON-RPC `starknet_getEvents` partially fixed
- Minting now uses tx v1 (when `lite: true` not specified)
- Updated L1-L2 messaging contracts

- The development team's focus has mostly been on rewriting Devnet in Rust (new repo: https://github.com/0xSpaceShard/starknet-devnet-rs)
- The Pythonic Devnet will receive at least one more stable version (adapted to Starknet 0.12.1 and compiler 2.2.0):
  - a potential pre-release adapted to Starknet 0.12.1a0 - maybe next week
  - a stable release - shortly after testnet (alpha-goerli) is updated to Starknet 0.12.1","","❤️ (4),👀 (2),🇮🇪 (1)"
