Hello üëã I was wondering, is it possible to declare a cairo1 contract using json rpc provider? I am using starknet-rs from git, and can see there is an example with cairo1 contract declaration, but it is using gateway. 

I tried to do something similar using rpc, but keep getting `Error: Invalid call data` , my guess is that nonce is not being read correctly (but I'm not sure yet). Has anyone tried it and succeded?

I am using devnet to test this, and compiled my contract using compiler version 1.1.0. The same contract can be successfully declared using other sdk (jvm). Here's the relevant code snippet:

```
    let contract_definition: SierraClass = serde_json::from_reader(std::fs::File::open(sierra_contract_path).unwrap()).unwrap();
    let casm_contract_definition: CompiledClass =  serde_json::from_reader(std::fs::File::open(casm_contract_path).unwrap()).unwrap();

    let casm_class_hash = casm_contract_definition.class_hash()?;

    let declaration = account.declare(Arc::new(contract_definition.flatten()?), casm_class_hash).fee_estimate_multiplier(1.5f64);
    let declared = declaration.send().await?;

"950845066086350939","glihm","23/09/2023 1:07 pm","Hum well it very depends on your contract and your functions.

But we just release a more advanced version of the abi gen: https://github.com/glihm/starknet-abigen-rs

We will do the events this weekend or next week. But now you can:

1. Generate the bindings from your ABI.
2. Serialize/Deserialize any cairo type including your own structs/enums (they can be generic too).
3. You can do calls/invoke directly from the generated code.

Examples here in the repo: https://github.com/glihm/starknet-abigen-rs/blob/main/src/main.rs","",""

is there any parser like serde that I can use to deser FieldElements to the Verifier struct , I can create the verifier struct in rust easily","",""
"950845066086350939","glihm","23/09/2023 7:22 pm","This is what we try to build with abigen and hopefully it will become part of `starknet-rs` itself.

If you want to do the deserialization yourself, you'll have to parse the `verifier_data` and verify you have the correct values to then create your struct.

Or using abi generation you can directly do like this:
```rust
let verifier_data: VerifierData = your_contract.getVerifier();
``` 
You first need to generate the binding from your ABI. For this you can check the README here https://github.com/glihm/starknet-abigen-rs. üëç","",""
