I‚Äôm using the docker instructions and I was able to get it bootstrapped..

But every time I want to change the node configuration, I have to stop the docker image.

And when I run it again, it requires an init.url and downloads a 33 gig file and starts the sync from the beginning every time.

When I run geth it uses the chain dir and I have complete control, but since docker takes over a lot of overhead, it‚Äôs tough to control.

Is there any way to stop the node, change flag params, and restart it, without having to sync the whole chain every time, while still using docker?","",""

I am able build blockscout locally using the source provided with:
```

I'm running into an issue when trying to set up the Nitro client's L1 RPC connection with a self-hosted Erigon node. This is the response from the L1 node when starting up the client:
```INFO [04-12|07:12:53.146] received error response from L1 RPC      request=""{\""jsonrpc\"":\""2.0\"",\""id\"":1,\""method\"":\""eth_chainId\""}"" response=nil err=""403 Forbidden: missing token\n""

However, I've confirmed that the nitro client loads the correct secret from file (`--auth.jwtsecret=<path/to/secret/file>`) so I'm thinking something else is acting up along the way.

Although we move Classic's latest state as Nitro's genesis state (see [state migration](../migration/state-migration.mdx)), but nitro stack can't serve arcive requests for pre-nitro blocks, so you have 3 options to run an Arbitrm One archive node:
1. Only post-nitro archive requests needs, you can see [running-a-node].

I'm in kubernetes and whenever I need to restart the node to update settings it does indeed take a long time to restart because it's repairing the state after what seems to be an unclean shutdown.

I allowed a longer grace period (6 minutes) to give it time to respond to the TERM signal, but it never seems to respond and kubernetes kills the pod, resulting in the corrupted state. At this point I'm 80% sure this is what's happening but don't know what to do. The docs say using `docker stop` is the correct way to shutdown and that also just sends the TERM signal so this should work for kubernetes as well.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
Additional details: I was using the helm chart from the graphops repo which uses node version v2.0.10-73224e3.

The transaction does not get into the block and the error is presented instantly by the node.
But when I do the same on a arbitrum goerli testnet node: the node returns a transaction hash as a response, the transaction gets into the block but gets rejected afterwards (it is also visible on arbiscan).

I hah this vps : 
6 cores,
16 Go RAM,
1.2 To SSD,
600Mb/s down

It took around 10 hours to sync, and the database was less than 30 Go. no pruning.
I have few questions regarding L1 Data Fee and the frequency of the settlement tx on the L1 :
  - There is a L1PricerFundsPool account on Arbitrum One but I can't find it on Nova. Does the pricing of the L1 Data Fee on Nova has the same mechanism of Arbitrum One ?

- When calculating L1 Data Fee for an L2 transaction do you apply the fee on the full input of the L2 transaction, or do you apply the fee on the compressed (Brotli-zero) data input ? 

- Settlement Tx Frequency on the sequencer inbox seems to follow two rules :
    a. minimum frequency  is 30 minutes.
    b. Frequency scales exponentially with the data size of the L2 blocks
Can you confirm that ?

Thank you for your answer","",""

After syncing is there any speed difference in using a local node vs hosted provider? In the docs it states the following below.

```
When fully synced, the Arbitrum node uses the State Transition Function (STF) to consume transactions coming from the Sequencer feed and creates a new state. It also waits for the L1 batch to be posted. If the L1 batch that is finalized on L1 is different from what the Sequencer published, the node will change the state based on the L1 batched transactions.
```

I'll let you know if something changes here. I don't think modifying the block header's timestamp would be possible because the header format is standard and assumed by a lot of tooling to be a unix timestamp, but potentially we could do something like include the more precise timestamp in the feed

One way you might be able to get some more confidence in the latency would be just looking at the difference between timestamp you get a block at and timestamp on the block. Blocks for arbitrum one are produced at a variable rate depending on the rate of transactions with at most 1 block per .25 seconds, but on arbitrum one there's enough traffic that it's almost a full 4 blocks/second. I think you should be able to roughly guess your latency by just looking at how many blocks arrive in the same second as you see on the timestamp. That can at least get you to estimating the latency to the nearest 250ms vs to the nearest second","",""

Also, if you're mounting /home/user/.arbitrum to /usr/local/arbitrum, make sure that docker can write in that local folder, and you could try running docker-compose from a different folder (I'm not 100% sure, but there could be potential issues with mounting a volume to a folder where you're executing an instruction).
