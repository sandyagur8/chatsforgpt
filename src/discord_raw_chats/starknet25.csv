"491328708821647361","meerkat_meex","03/03/2022 1:02 pm","Hi, the node type shouldn't matter. So far we've tested almost exclusively using Infura's service (which is geth? I think), but so long as the node supports the basic Ethereum API it should be okay. It would be nice to have people try out different nodes to see if it breaks. 

If you just want to run on Goerli, then Infura provides free archive nodes.

We are thinking of ways to remove this restrictions -- or at least provide alternative modes of operation. Currently pathfinder is itself a full archive node of starknet, which is why it requires an L1 archive node to validate against. So overall it depends on how people want to use pathfinder. If you're only interested in the latest history, then technically one wouldn't need an L1 archive node. But it will require work on our end to make this happen.","","üëç (1)"

I was able to sync just using fullnode. And what I have seen during the sync is that pathfinder only calls eth_chainId, eth_getLogs and eth_blockNumber all of which are available on every full node. Was that behaviour because I didnt actually usr RPC endpoint during the sync?","",""

The only issue with using a full node is that the historical starknet data can't be validated. And currently I suspect our logic won't validate the latter blocks either because it expects to start validating from genesis.

You will still have the starknet data available; it will just always say `L2_ACCEPTED` as its status, and never `L1_ACCEPTED`. So essentially you're just trusting the sequencer for now.","",""

The Starknet sequencer is talking to its L1 node and once it accepts the transaction, the sequencer says that block is L1 Accepted. Voyager then gets this information and displays the block as L1 Accepted.

Some time later, the L1 node pathfinder is talking to gets this updated L1 information.

The node is currently CPU and memory light. Storage.. depends on the Starknet network size. Our node is an archive node only currently. Which means it will just keep growing in storage requirements.

Currently database size estimates:
```
mainnet: 300MB (1.3k blocks)
goerlie: 20GB  (130k blocks)
```
In the future we still need to add p2p, which means CPU and RAM requirements will go up. They probably won't go up dramatically, but I'm hesitant to promise anything before we've actually met our requirements. Put differently, being super light is not part of the spec, but is obviously nice to have.

Storage will also grow as we add features. For example we have event support coming up. Which means we need to start indexing on those, increasing database size.","",""

Whereas a normal full node would typically only store some of that information permanently, and otherwise only the latest 128 blocks or so.

In bitcoin, I think a light-node stores only the latest block headers and for other queries it forwards those to other nodes. So it stores almost nothing locally -- meant for tiny storage like mobile etc.

Because Starknet offers zk-proofs it means we don't have to execute transactions locally to verify state, so we save a lot of CPU there.

What p2p will enable is faster sync due to having data in more places. Currently each node downloads its data from the starknet sequencer. Which is under heavy load and quite erratic. With p2p this data can be downloaded once by a node and then shared through the network.","",""

A Starknet block consists of a set of transactions. When executed in the context of the previous Starknet, these result in a new Starknet state, trigger some events and L1 <-> L2 messages.

The new starknet state is represented as a state diff between the previous state and the new state. This state diff consists of two lists. Lists 1 is the list of new contracts deployed. List 2 is the list of changes to the contracts storages. We apply this state diff and check that the resulting state Merkle-Patricia trie root matches the one on L1 (L1 data is currently just the new state root). This implies that the state diff supplied by the sequencer matches the one accepted by L1.

`screen -r <session_id>`

the other way would be to pipe the output of the node into a log file and then use the tail command to check it in real time

example

run the node like this

`cargo run --release --bin pathfinder -- --ethereum.url https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<infura_id> >> logfile.txt`

this will pipe the output into logfile.txt, then you can read the logs using tail command like this

You will easily be able to run this node on a 2GHz dual-core, 1 GB ram (it uses a lot less, but just in case :D), and 100GB of hard-drive space will last a fair while (but will currently fill up as we store full history still).

Deploying starknet node now and found weird thing 

I got response from `starknet_syncing` : 

```
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""result"": {
    ""starting_block"": ""0x0"",
    ""current_block"": ""0xf6e914fb65b469e57a2799adcd91425d2379685e3b902ab08788f82d5f8013"",

  },
  ""id"": 0
}
```

but from docs (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/master/api/starknet_api_openrpc.json) im expecting `false` if node is synced. 
so there is a question: 

1) does node really synced up if current_block hash equals highest_block hash ? or it is not ? 
2) maybe there is a bug in endpoint ? 

appreciate for answer","",""

We installed Mainnet, and at the time of writing the guide there were about 1400 blocks, and a new block appeared once every hour.

To return to this desktop and ensure that the node is still running and syncing even after PuTTY closes, you can specify the command:

1) Very easy to set-up üö§
2) Node is more then stable, no unexpected shot downs or any errors
3) Alchemy app is super convenient to track progress, and just to make sure your node  is running, no need to enter SSH client 
4) Hardware I used 2 core 2 GB RAM 100 GB SSD, which is quite lightweight nowadays 

I'm really surprised with Starknet ecosystem growing so fast, DeFI, Games, NFT's partners keep on-boarding, looks promising, Thank you for your time and have a nice day. Peace!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/948559061685796894/957999405586321481/2022-03-28_16.46.49.png",""

1- First of all, I rented a server to run testnet. I have successfully completed the node installation steps. (via CMD) However, when I wanted to leave CMD/close my connection from the server (ctrl c) it disconnected me from INFURA even though I downloaded all the blocks, so no reguest data came.

2- I thought I made a mistake during the installation phase and I deleted the server and reinstalled it. (My only shortcoming is SCREEN -S Main Page) Node successfully communicated with INFURA. However, after a certain time/about 10 hours, I realized that he lost contact with INFURA again. I don't know if node was running in the background but the solution was that I needed to reach the server and start ""cargo run --release --bin pathfinder -- --ethereum.url https://mainnet.infura. io/ v3/** It was because I ran the "" command. But it works when cmd is open, when I close it, communication is lost.

So, what I want to mention briefly is that when I want to exit the virtual server, there is a lack of communication in the node.

How can I solve this?","",""

503 service unavailable: for some reason your L1 node is not responding -- nothing pathfinder can do about this, and it seems like your L1 node did start responding again.

L1 reorg occurred: the Ethereum chain did a reorg -- this is an uncommon event, but not a reason for concern. We should probably make this an INFO event and not a warning. We were just interested to know how often this occurs in reality, so we highlighted it by making it a warning.

429 too many requests: your L1 node is rate limiting us -- you've likely exceeded your daily request limit for the day (if you're using a service like infura/alchemy). pathfinder will keep retrying, and once the rate limiting is over, will continue as normal.

The following is for your referenceÔºöyou will easily be able to run this node on a 2GHz dual-core, 1 GB ram (it uses a lot less, but just in case :D), and 100GB of hard-drive space will last a fair while (but will currently fill up as we store full history still).

This release  fixes the incompatibility with Starknet 0.8.1 (`error decoding response body: unknown field class_hash` error) and also fixes an issue which causes `pathfinder` to effectively DoS the Starknet sequencer.
**Please upgrade to this release to help with the increased load on the testnet sequencer!**

Release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.1.8-alpha

To update your node:

If you're running locally and compiling it:
```git fetch
git checkout v0.1.8-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate

In most instances, hitting your throughput limit will not affect your user's experience engaging with your application. As long as retries are implemented, the requests will go through in the following second. As a general rule of thumb, if you are experiencing under 30% rate limited requests, using retries is the best solution.`

Announcing a new  `pathfinder` release, version `0.1.10-alpha`. This version is required to work with StarkNet 0.8.2 release.

The easiest way to run `pathfinder` is using our docker images. To update your `pathfinder` docker image, simply run 
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If you're compiling `pathfinder` yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder repository):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.1.10-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
For full release notes, please see our release page: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.1.9-alpha

Highlights:
- Support StarkNet 0.8.2 changes
- Pathfinder release monitoring
    - Pathfinder actively monitors github for new releases
    - A warning level log will be emitted if a new release is detected
- Support data directory config item
- Set user-agent in L1 and L2 queries
    - the Ethereum user-agent config item is now deprecated
- Add block numbers to sync status API
- Support deploy and invoke transactions via RPC API","","üëç (18),StarkNet (10)"

There is a new `0.1.10-alpha` pathfinder release. This just contains a single minor fix, but it would still be good to update.

The easiest way to run pathfinder is using our docker images. To update your pathfinder docker image, simply run 
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If you're compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder repository):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.1.10-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py

The general idea being that the queries have an identifier by which they're identified and used in the same places. So the interface would essentially be SQL queries that maintain parameter names and types (optionally also ordering).

This would allow one to change the engine, tune queries and even choose location of the database more easily.

Even more would be to define a thin interface in case someone wants to try a different storage engine altogether (like key-value store, graph database and so on).","",""

Yes, you can it whenever you want.

> But can you give more explanation about 2nd question's answer.
Some people expect there to be rewards for running a node, but there aren't any.

Running pathfinder, gives you a local copy of starknet state which has been verified against L1. This means you don't have to trust the sequencer and have the data locally which means faster queries. This is beneficial if you're building apps, or want to provide a service on starknet","",""

This release has **breaking changes for those who use docker through systemd or scripts** and in rpc responses, check the release notes out! Biggest improvement in this release is supporting cairo-lang and starknet 0.9.0 which released today on goerli/testnet. If you are following mainnet, this upgrade should be completed before mainnet is upgraded, or syncing it will halt.

To upgrade the docker image, just
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.2.0-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

You need access to a full node -- however note that if using Infura that you do need their archive node type (otherwise we can't access all logs).

You need a lot less space on mainnet -- think currently the space used is about 1 GB on mainnet, but 60 GB on testnet. The pathfinder node is currently archive type only, so the storage requirements will just keep growing.

Pathfinder nodes are essentially just local read-only copies of the StarkNet state. They don't participate in any consensus or mining or anything, since there isn't any in StarkNet.

P2P is planned, but initially its only function will be to speed up the sync process and to share data with other node types like light clients or whatever people create in the future.

Currently each pathfinder node downloads the data from StarkWare's sequencer gateway, verifies that against L1 and then stores it locally.","","üëç (2)"

To upgrade the docker image, just

```
git fetch
git checkout v0.2.2-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate

# also don't forget to copy or move

So when you start the first instance it grabs that address. Then when you start the second instance, it also tries to grab that address but fails because it is already taken by the first one.

To solve this; you need to configure the second node to use a different address. You can configure this using the `PATHFINDER_HTTP_RPC_ADDRESS` environment variable if you are using docker.

For example using a different port (9600):
```
docker run \
  --rm \
  -p 9545:9545 \
  -e RUST_LOG=info \
  -e PATHFINDER_ETHEREUM_API_URL=""https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<project-id>"" \

If you are upgrading from 0.2.1-alpha or earlier, there will be a database migration in the first start.

To upgrade the docker image, just
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.2.3-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

Create a directory where you want to store the node data. In this example it uses `$HOME/pathfinder` as that directory (`$HOME` is a shortcut for your user's home directory).

You use `mkdir <path-to-directory>` to create that directory. So in the example it is `mkdir $HOME/pathfinder`.

You then need to tell docker to use this directory as the nodes directory which you do by mounting it with `-v <local-path>:<docker-path>` . In the example that is this line:

Docker is a way of bundling and running a smaller, virtual operating system called a container. The advantage of it is that we can create this container, and the conditions inside of it will always be the same. This lets us pretend that we always have ubuntu running inside the container -- even if its being run on MacOS or Windows.

To upgrade the docker image, just
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.2.4-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

I suspect the node's data directory isn't in your `/home`. This path can be configured using `--data-directory` but it defaults to the current directory you are calling the binary from. If this is the case, a solution is:

1. identify the current data directory (the node generates database files, `goerli.sqlite` + some optional smaller files)
2. copy those files to your desired directory `<path>`
3. restart the node, but with `--data-directory <path>`

To upgrade the docker image, just
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.2.6-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

Now usually this isn't a problem because reads are quick and so are writes; so things just wait for a few milliseconds and then get on with their part. The exception being.. `call` and `estimateFee`. Because they (a) are python (slow), and (b) execute an arbitrary amount of starknet code.

When the database is locked by your `call` query, it prevents our sync process from writing and it eventually times out while waiting for access üí• 

WAL mode enables sqlite to have concurrent reads and writes by using a journal file. A database write gets written to this journal file instead of the main database, and gets merged in whenever the database is unlocked. So when active, your `call` will still prevent writes to the database, but our sync process will write to the journal file instead.

This is a breaking release, with a revamped JSON-RPC API. It now fully supports the official `v0.1.0` JSON-RPC specification.

For more information please read the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.3.0-alpha

We have also updated the database snapshots.

To upgrade the docker image, just
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```

If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.3.0-alpha
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

This release fixes a bug which caused database corruption. You should consider your current database suspect and delete it. The database file is the `goerli.sqlite` or `mainnet.sqlite` file that your pathfinder node creates. You must then either resync from the beginning, or use our snapshots to get up to speed much faster:

mainnet: https://storage.googleapis.com/eq-pathfinder-database-snapshots/mainnet_4400.sqlite.xz
testnet: https://storage.googleapis.com/eq-pathfinder-database-snapshots/goerli_306k.sqlite.xz

The snapshots are compressed using `xz` so you first need to decompress them:
```
xz --decompress <snapshot filepath>
```
and then you should rename and move them to match the original pathfinder database.

For more information on the release please read the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.3.1

We have also updated the database snapshots.

To upgrade the docker image, just
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```

If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.3.1
cargo build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!```

"117430577891639300","darkosnightmare","06/09/2022 5:24 am","I think there is *possibly* a bug that results in `L1_HANDLER` transactions not returning events when queried via RPC. When I query with:
```
{
    ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
    ""method"": ""starknet_getTransactionReceipt"",
    ""params"": {
        ""transaction_hash"": ""0x273b2274aff1ea15339d2595f41d87546e27299df626385788870334eddfb3b""
    }
}
```
against Infura (uses Pathfinder) I receive the following:
```
{
    ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
    ""result"": {
        ""transaction_hash"": ""0x273b2274aff1ea15339d2595f41d87546e27299df626385788870334eddfb3b"",
        ""actual_fee"": ""0x0"",
        ""status"": ""ACCEPTED_ON_L1"",
        ""block_hash"": ""0x7fa78e19b1432aa12b88684da11c5d28ebffa8aa4810ae972f7f37267c32cd1"",
        ""block_number"": 322610
    },
    ""id"": 0
}
```
which does not include any events. Where as you can see that querying against the sequencer there are 15 events: https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_transaction_receipt?transactionHash=0x273b2274aff1ea15339d2595f41d87546e27299df626385788870334eddfb3b

I guess ""does it make sense"" to run these on the same node depends on how large is your instance and how much of it geth uses. a rarely used pathfinder will take megabytes of RAM but if you start to run a lot of `starknet_call` or `starknet_estimateFee` then you might get into issues. also diskspace is required. during sync more resources are ofc required.","",""

Instructions:
```
1. Download the mainnet or goerli snapshot file from the mirror closest to you.
2. Verify the SHA-256 checksum (compressed) to ensure it downloaded correctly
3. Decompress the file: `xz --decompress <filepath>`
4. Verify the SHA-256 checksum again (decompressed)
5. Rename the file to `goerli.sqlite` or `mainnet.sqlite`
6. Move the file to the location expected by pathfinder. This is the `--data-directory`, which defaults to the current directory you run pathfinder from. Or if you are using, the volume you pass to docker command. This will mean replacing your existing database file if its already there.

Release summary:

- Adds support for Starknet 0.10.1 (currently scheduled to be released on testnet on 18th October). **Upgrading to this release is required so that pathfinder can keep on syncing with Starknet 0.10.1.**
- Adds an implementation of the 0.2.1-rc1 version of the JSON-RPC specification (with some caveats, please check the release notes). The new API is published on the /rpc/v0.2 path, while the JSON-RPC server for the older 0.1.0 version of the API is still available both on / (root) and /rpc/v0.1.
- We have added new metrics to get a better insight into communication with the Starknet gateway.

To upgrade the docker image, just
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder`

If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```git fetch
git checkout v0.3.6
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!```

Release summary:
- Upgrading to cairo-lang 0.10.1 internally, enabling the starknet_estimateFee method to properly process  DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transactions
- Fixes a regression in Pathfinder 0.3.6 that causes pathfinder to return ""Internal error"" errors when calling starknet_call or starknet_estimateFee with a block_id specified as a block number.

To upgrade the docker image, just
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder`

If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```git fetch
git checkout v0.3.7
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!```

Release summary:
- Fixes some minor problems in a few JSON-RPC methods.
- Improves the performance of starknet_getTransactionReceipt by about 20%.
- Adds the `--testnet2` command-line flag that instructs pathfinder to connect to the second Starknet testnet.

To upgrade the docker image, just
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder`

If you are compiling pathfinder yourself, update by (from within the pathfinder working copy):
```git fetch
git checkout v0.3.8
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!```

If you plan on using the RPC API very very heavily then you may need to experiment with adding a few more cores, but this should really be enough for most users.","",""

The breaking change is changing the root rpc to serve v0.2 of the spec instead of v0.1. v0.1 is still available via the direct path `/rpc/v01`.

You can find a more detailed explanation in the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.0

To update your node:

If running docker:
```
docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder
```
If running a compiled from source version, do the following commands from with the pathfinder source directory:
```
git fetch
git checkout v0.4.0
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!

My pathfinder node seems to struggle catching up with the live block generation.
But maybe I'm reading the loggs wrong.
```
L1 sync updated with blocks 455574 - 455578
2022-11-28T14:52:52.806087Z  INFO Updated StarkNet state with block 384563
2022-11-28T14:53:12.948055Z  INFO Updated StarkNet state with block 384564
2022-11-28T14:53:32.101538Z  INFO Updated StarkNet state with block 384565
```

Does that mean I'm at StarkNet block **384565**
or at block **455578**.

I would think it's 384565.... but that number goes up so slowly it probably take at least a month to catch up.","",""

1. To start we will need to deploy python3.8 which is not available on ubuntu repos by default. But its available on python website so I installed in manually. Just execute the following commands one by one:

> sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev wget libbz2-dev
> wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/Python-3.8.0.tgz
> tar -xf Python-3.8.0.tgz
> cd Python-3.8.0
> ./configure --enable-optimizations
> make -j 8
> sudo make altinstall
> python3.8 --version


it will take time to make it. as a final output you should see **Python 3.8.0**

Then follow pathfinder guide:

> sudo apt install curl git
> curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Prompt will ask you about action, select 1.

then configure shell by executing:

> source ""$HOME/.cargo/env""

Check the version by:
> cargo --version

should return ""**cargo 1.66.0 (d65d197ad 2022-11-15)**"" or higher.

Once done, download Pathfinder of actual version:

> sudo apt install git
> git clone --branch v0.4.3 https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder.git

current version might be found here in threads 4.4 seems to be valid today (20.12.22).
Once downloaded, go to the pathfinder/py folder and set venv using python 3.8 we installed earlier:
> cd pathfinder/py/
> python3.8 -m venv .venv
> source .venv/bin/activate
Then install dependencies:
> PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install --upgrade pip
> PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

and run the node:
> cargo run --release --bin pathfinder -- --ethereum.url https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YourAPIKey 

using your API key from alchemy: https://dashboard.alchemy.com

thats it, you should see syncing state of the node!","",""

You can find a more detailed explanation in the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.5

To update your node:
If running docker:
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder`

If running a compiled from source version, do the following commands from with the pathfinder source directory:
```git fetch
git checkout v0.4.5
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

# also don't forget to copy or move

- starknet v0.11.0 support
- RPC API v0.3 partial support
- removed several deprecated config options
- requires python 3.9 or 3.10 (no longer 3.8)

You can find a more detailed explanation in the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.5.0

Please note that upgrading to this release requires a database migration that is performed automatically upon first run -- this might take some time, please be patient. To update your node:

If running docker:
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder:`

If running a compiled from source version, do the following commands from with the pathfinder source directory:
```git fetch
git checkout v0.5.0
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to

I would like to use a compiled from source v0.5.0.
I migrated to python 3.9.5.
I had some problems due to PEP517, solved by 
`sudo pip install PEP517 --no-binary :all:`
pip list is now :
```
Package       Version
------------- -------
pip           23.0.1
pkg_resources 0.0.0
setuptools    67.6.0
wheel         0.40.0
```
But I have an error with `PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
I have this error message :
```

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

Same thing with `pip install fastecdsa`

This release fixes a few RPC bugs and adds support for bulk fee estimation and transaction simulation (traces) as part of v0.3 RPC specification.

In addition it also adds a `pathfinder_getTransactionStatus` endpoint which lets you track a transactions status -- including REJECTED and RECEIVED -- in the same fashion as the gateway.

Please also check the release announcement / notes of Pathfinder v0.5.0 if you haven't upgraded to 0.5.0 yet. That one is a breaking release with many important changes.

You can find a more detailed explanation in the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.5.2

To update your node:

If running docker:
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder`

If running a compiled from source version, do the following commands from with the pathfinder source directory:
```git fetch
git checkout v0.5.2
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!```","","üëç (1)"

The left side of the picture uses a full node, and the right side uses a gateway. They use the same method calls to the same contract to run concurrently, but return different data. After comparison, the data returned by the gateway is as accurate as the front-end page, while the data returned by the full node is almost one block slower. May I ask why this is so? Is self-built node slow? It seems that the self-built node will not capture the data of the block in the pending state, so it will slow down the time of one block. How to solve this problem? Using gatewayclient can access pending data, so it is more accurate and faster.

This release fixes several issues introduced in v0.5.2.

A dependency update in v0.5.2 incidentally changed the maximum number of RPC connections from unbounded to 100.
We've now changed the default to 1024 connections, and it can be configured using `--max-rpc-connections`.

You can find a more detailed explanation in the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.5.3

To update your node:

If running docker:
`docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder`

If running a compiled from source version, do the following commands from with the pathfinder source directory:
```git fetch
git checkout v0.5.3
rustup update stable
cargo +stable build --release --bin pathfinder
cd py
source .venv/bin/activate
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true pip install -e .[dev]

# also don't forget to copy or move
# target/release/pathfinder to the place your scripts
# expect to find it! consult the guide you used to
# install in the first place!```","",""

We can observe that a Full Node can synchronize its state from three sources: the Sequencer, P2P (other Full Nodes), and Ethereum. If the contents of these three sources differ, how would a Full Node decide the current state?

Based on my understanding:

1. When a Full Node synchronizes a new transaction pending from the Sequencer, it adds this new transaction to the Pending state.
2. Once the Sequencer successfully executes the transaction and obtains the state_diff, the transaction enters the Accepted on Layer2 state. At this point, the new state will be updated in the Local DB of the running Node.
3. After the Layer1 Core (Rollup) Contract updates the state_diff, the transaction enters the Accepted on Layer1 state.

I believe there might be inaccuracies in my description, and I'm unsure about the correct approach. I would appreciate it if you could correct my description. Thank you very much!","",""

This release is required for starknet v0.12 which launches on testnet next week Monday 03/07. Testnet nodes should therefore be upgraded before then if possible.

Notable changes:
- added new sync related metrics which may be of interest
- added configuration for poll rate, although the default should be more than adequate already
- `starknet_estimateMessageFee` added
- `starknet_getEvents` bug fixed which caused queries with large block ranges to timeout / take really long. We also now return an error if the query is too unspecific and would cause query to take long even with the fix.

For details please check the release notes: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.6.2

To upgrade your node please follow the pathfinder documentation here: https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder#updating-the-docker-image

Install Docker Follow Step1 : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04

Run Pathfinder:
`docker run -t -d -p 9545:9545 -p 9552:9552 --name pathfinder --user ""$(id -u):$(id -g)"" -e RUST_LOG=pathfinder=debug -e PATHFINDER_ETHEREUM_API_URL=""https://goerli.infura.io/v3/....."" -v /mnt/extradisk/pathfinder:/usr/share/pathfinder/data eqlabs/pathfinder:latest --network testnet2 --monitor-address 0.0.0.0:9552 --poll-pending true`
`-t -d` -> to run in the background so you can free terminal
`-v /mnt/extradisk/pathfinder` -> i extended my docker droplet with 60GB volume and so set pathfinder database path there
`monitor-address 0.0.0.0:9552` -> address where monitoring data will be available
rest of parameters are self explanatori

Run Prometheus to scrape data:
`docker run -t -d \
    --name prom \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /root/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    prom/prometheus`

prometheus.yaml -> config, when changed to `docker restart prom`
`  - job_name: 'pathfinder'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['HERE_YOU_SET_YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:9552']`
I try target 0.0.0.0:9552 and it didn't work so I set full ip there","",""

Some Helpfull CLI:
DOCKERA STATUS:
sudo systemctl status docker

PATHFINDER STATUS
sudo docker logs -f pathfinder

FREE DISK SPACE

FILE SIZE IN DIR
ls -lh *

For rethreaving latest databse i used https://github.com/zkLend/starknet-snapshots and as i am connecting to goerli2 used latest snapshot from there so i downloaded as:
`curl -OL ""https://pathfinder-backup.zklend.com/goerli-2/goerli-2-v0.6.3-123022.tar.xz""`

and extracted with
`tar Jxvf ./name-of-the-file-you-downloaded --checkpoint=1000` 
I used --checkopint to see some extractio progress as it took like 5-10min.

And after that wait some time to sync missing ~6k blocks and thats it.
My block sync was super slow for 3 days like 3000 blocks and today it synce rest of the blocks 3000 in like 2h, so be patient.
I also setuped node extractor to have server stats on grafana but you can figure it out if you need..

Hope this helped.","",""

So after many hours i found a solution.
you need storage first of all  more than 600GB for now. Ive got an 1.6T by upgrading my contabo server.
now if you use nodes guru you have to extract the snapshot to the pathfinder/py
and then use the update command they have in their website. 
```wget -O starknet_update.sh https://api.nodes.guru/starknet_update.sh && chmod +x starknet_update.sh && ./starknet_update.sh
```
after update finished then you use 
```journalctl -u starknetd -f```

If you use docker commands. Then you have to extract snapshot in pathfinder folder.
then do the update process of the update with

# This updates pathfinder
```sudo docker pull eqlabs/pathfinder```
# This stops the running instance
```sudo docker stop pathfinder```
# This removes the current instance (using the old version of pathfinder)
```sudo docker rm pathfinder```

# This command re-creates the container instance with the latest version
```sudo docker run \
  --name pathfinder \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --detach \
  -p 9545:9545 \
  --user ""$(id -u):$(id -g)"" \
  -e RUST_LOG=info \
  -e PATHFINDER_ETHEREUM_API_URL=""Alchemy_ETH URL"" \
  -v $HOME/pathfinder:/usr/share/pathfinder/data \

# Check Logs
