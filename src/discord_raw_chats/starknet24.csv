I have learned many things.
My initial knowledge : Typescript, Cairo0, basics of rust. I performed Starklings-cairo 0 a while ago.
Some constructive feedbacks :
- Many links are dead (commit 7df0a9d839da023e0a59937824a27842cea8f925).
- enums exercises should be after structs exercises.
- I didn't succeed arrays3 (it's the only one). I tried with .get, but didn't succeed. Should be added some hints. (I didn't read the result branch).
- move_semantics was very problematic, due to lack of documentation. I do not see guys with 0 knowledge of rust to succeed. To create a doc on this subject should be a priority. Hint of move_semantics2 was impossible to understand.
- * and & usage should be included in exercises.","",""

We're currently working on a proper documentation for Cairo 1. Without Rust experience it's alittle hard around the edges, that's why I often advise to start with Rustlings and a bit of Rust to get the concepts, and then translate them to cairo.

Links were fixed in a recent commit
Why do you think enums should be after structs? Is there anything that requires struct knowledge?
Once proper documentation is there it should be easier. We will work on improving the exercies","",""

im confused by a few things:

- how can we anotate with the #[contract] macro if it's not imported anywhere? shouldn't it be `#[starknet::contract]`?
- what is #[abi] ? i dont see it in the docs. shouldn't is be `#[starknet::interface]` instead?
- why is it always written #[external(v0)] in the docs? what's the difference with #[external] ?
- regarding storage: is #[storage] useful? it seems like it works if i remove it. And does the storage struct always has to be named `Storage`?
