For example when I'm calling ``address = await contract.get_my_address().call()`` where ``get_my_address()`` is just returning  ``get_caller_address()`` I get the 0 address

What I mean is for exemple when using the basic hardhat test for solidity smart contracts, the contracts are automatically called with ``ethers.getSigners()[0]``  and we can use ``.connect(<account>)`` to interact with a function through another caller

So my question is how to do that the correct way with pytest, do I need to use sth like starknet.py or am I missing something","",""

I make tests in Python with Pytest. I saw on internet that you can call a function without putting the parenthesis like in my screen in the function `proxy_init` where I make `account_cls, implementation_cls, proxy_cls = contract_classes`. 
I understand that is to get the reference of a function without executing it directly. When I run the tests, I get this error `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable coroutine object`. On the web, they told me that I have to add the parenthesis but as I'm stubborn and I've seen codes that do it without the parenthesis, could someone explain me why in my case it doesn't work?

@pytest.mark.asyncio

    # get an instance of the contract
    contract = await get_contract()

    # check if the balance is 0
    # getBalance uses @raw_input
    execution_info = await contract.getBalance().call()
    # maybe i should expect a tuple here
    assert execution_info.result.res == 0
```

But it fails with error ""AssertionError: Direct raw_input function calls are not supported."". Is there any solution or workaround for this?","",""

So if anyone needs to ever test a raw function, this seems to be the way to do it. However, be aware that there might be a better one!

There is a function called ""execute_entry_point_raw"" on the starknet.state object which can be used to test raw functions.

```
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_initial_balance_zero():
    """"""Initial balance should be 0""""""
    # create a new Starknet class that simulates the StarkNet system.
    starknet = await Starknet.empty()
    # deploy the contract.
    contract = await starknet.deploy(source=CONTRACT_FILE,)

    # execute the raw function
    result = await starknet.state.execute_entry_point_raw(
        contract_address=contract.contract_address,
        selector=get_selector_from_name('getBalance'),
        calldata=[],
