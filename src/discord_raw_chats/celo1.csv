I have been checking  celostats reporting issues on baklava and seems that the stats submitting cannot recover when the connection is interrupted. Restarting the validator or the proxy seems to fix it and it starts reporting again. I will try to dig a bit deeper on the problems to see if we can recover gracefully without restarting any component.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/783326878806048819/783373531378745414/unknown.png","üëç (1)"

@timmoreton | cLabs @Valentin | cLabs 

We want to work on this. To me, there are still problems with validators having problem connecting or sending info to celostats. Or maybe it's about loosing the connection and never reconnect. But that's to me the MAIN issue to resolve.

After that, we want to add many things to the payload we report. The things listed by tim are some of them. This imply changing the network protocol so that proxy can get info from the validator, right now it only gets the signature.

The way i see it, we would need web help on fixing the connecting issue, it's unclear whose the culprit here... if the reporter or the server.

For the expanded reports, I think we can split the problems into:

a) Be able to report more info, and get that by API on the server (but not on the UI)

- what is the low hanging fruit we could address to make it more useful? (see the great feedback from validators)
- how do we effectively collaborate between blockchain <> web services? Seems like no to a bubble, but would one blockchain eng partner with web-services team to investigate?

1. Though the peer limits can be specified with `--maxpeers` and `--light.maxpeers`, their handling (inherited from upstream) seems questionable.  For example, if you use 1100 for maxpeers and 1000 for light.maxpeers (as we recommend in the docs for full nodes), p2p server's dialed peers goal is still maxpeers / DialRatio, or maxpeers / 3, which in this case would be 366.  AFAIK, light servers don't dial light clients (only the other way around), since light clients run only discv5 and don't advertise the LES topic, so light servers wouldn't find light clients through discovery (only the other way around).  So what would happen if the node gets to 100 eth peers is it would then continue to try dialing more peers but when it connects to them it would immediately disconnect them due to already being at its limit of 100 for eth peers.  I confirmed this behavior using go-ethereum with lower limits (maxpeers 105, light.maxpeers 100).  This may not be trivial to fix because `p2p/server.go` is used both by the light client and the light server
2. `--light.serve` supports values larger than 100%.  At first I was puzzled by the following code, which looks like it makes threads always be 4: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/b44f24e3e6644a2034ce23037827b21aa59e441d/les/server.go#L85-L90 (link points to current master, but the logic is the same going back to Feb 2019).  Then I found out that 100 isn't the maximum value, as mentioned at https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/18230 and https://gist.github.com/zsfelfoldi/93792da3c56dffdb594ff91aebd74262 .

Don't remember seeing major changes in how the flags are read and used.  There is definitely some unintuitive behavior in how the params are handled in both go-ethereum and celo-blockchain, in that it behaves differently when it uses the defaults than when you specify explicitly values equal to the defaults.
e.g. go-ethereum with defaults (50 maxpeers and 100 light.maxpeers): `ETH=50 LES=100 total=150`
go-ethereum with --maxpeers 50 and --light.maxpeers 100: `ETH=-50 LES=100 total=50` (which later errors out because ETH is less than zero).  In other words, if you rely on the defaults it adds light to max peers, while if you use the flags it assumes light is included in maxpeers.","",""

"456226577798135808","Deleted User","14/01/2021 9:06 pm","@Joshua and I have been looking into the missed blocks on baklava.  A positive result is that the randomness bugfix worked!  That, combined with everyone now having upgraded to Churrito means we no longer have any validators.  Besides that, here are some findings:
1. There is a logic bug in `clearBacklogForSeq()` (https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/master/consensus/istanbul/core/backlog.go#L225-L227), which means that backlogs from previous blocks are never properly cleared.  As a result, the backlog can get full, and then storing new messages to the backlog fails and they are instead dropped.  We saw this in action on one of the validators.  However, this is not a regression from v1.2.x, and in the context in which it happened fixing it would not have prevented the problem.  The context was that a validator wasn't peered with the proposer of the block before the block it proposes.  As a result, it never got the preprepare for the parent block's consensus process and didn't process and store the commits it got.  Then when its turn to propose a block came, it could only include the quorum of signatures on the block itself, it couldn't add the other commits it got because it never processed them.
2. There are some remaining peering issues.  Some seem to involve actual networking errors (`""i/o timeout""` dialing those peers, and a case where in the discovery v4 logs we see node A pinging node B and getting a response, but when node B pings node A there is no response).  Some are suggestive of networking problems, but not definitive (one node correctly sends out enode query message for a node it needs to update its record for, but doesn't the response back).

"456226577798135808","Deleted User","14/01/2021 9:12 pm","More generally, we've identified three things that can lead to a missing signature on a block:
1. You are not peered with the proposer.  In this case you never get the preprepare and just can't participate in consensus at all for that block.
2. You are not peered with the next block's proposer.  In that case, your signature will be included in the block itself if your commit is among the first (2/3 of validator set size) commits that the proposer receives.  Otherwise, your signature will not be included in the block, and neither will it be added to the next block's parent seal because you aren't peered to the next block's proposer and so they can't get your commit.
3. The next block's proposer (Alice) isn't peered with the current block's proposer (Bob).  In that case, Alice won't get Bob's preprepare and so she can't process the commits she gets for that block, including the one she gets from you.  As a result, when its her turn to propose the block, she has no commits to add to the parent seal, and so 1/3 of the validators will end up having their signatures not included (leading to a very long red vertical column on celo cauldron).  We saw this happen a couple of days ago, and that is how we found the backlog bug. 
 But fixing that bug won't solve this problem, because Bob still wouldn't have the preprepare from Alice

"456226577798135808","Deleted User","14/01/2021 9:17 pm","We've previously thought of ways to make consensus more robust in the face of incomplete peering.  It seems that the biggest choke-point is the preprepare.  So we've been thinking that a big improvement would be to have some secondary mechanism for getting the preprepare to everyone, including nodes the proposer may not be connected to.  That way every node could participate and send out commits. And though the proposer may not get your commit, chances are the next block's proposer will and so then your signature will still get included. 

Essentially, to miss a block you'd have to:
```
not be peered to two consecutive proposers OR (not be in the first 2/3 of one block AND not peered to the next block's proposer)
```
rather than how it is now:
```
not be peered to the proposer OR (not be in the first 2/3 of one block AND not peered to the next block's proposer) OR (not be in the first 2/3 of one block AND the next proposer isn't peered to the current proposer)
```
This of course would mean some redundant network communication, but that might not be too bad because the preprepare is the least network-intensive part of consensus.  Of course, if we do this, the next choke-point is commits going to the next proposer, which could also then be improved.  We'd be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts about whether this would be feasible and the the possible downsides or tradeoffs involved.  To be clear, this would be an improvement for the future to make consensus more robust, not a solution to the remaining issues on baklava","",""

"456226577798135808","Deleted User","09/02/2021 1:19 am","Hi all!  We at cLabs have been kicking around an idea for a change that would improve compatibility with Ethereum wallets and tools, by **adding support for Ethereum-format transactions (i.e. transactions without the 3 Celo-only fields: fee currency, gateway fee, and gateway fee recipient)**.

I've created a proof of concept branch here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/tree/oneeman/eth-compatible-transactions-poc .  The way it works is, when we get a transaction an RLP, we identify based on the number of fields it has whether it's a normal Celo transaction or an eth-compatible transaction.  For serializing to JSON, I've added a boolean field to indicate whether it's an eth-compatible transaction (since in Javascript there is often less-than-full consistency on null vs absent fields).  It's not 100% clear whether that field is necessary, and of course it isn't final (this is just a proof of concept), but it seemed like a good idea.

I've tried this out, and it works out-of-the-box with Ethereum wallets such as metamask (see the screenshot).  Of course,  for eth-compatible transactions the fee has to be paid in Celo (can't use cUSD) and gateway fees can't be used (though, at the moment, gateway fees aren't being used anyway and it's not 100% clear whether full-node incentives will eventually use them or a different mechanism).

This would have to be done as part of a hard fork.  Though it's very late in the game, it may be worth delaying Donut to include this, since much of Donut is aimed at cross-chain bridges and this would lead to much better UX by allowing transacting both in Celo and Ethereum using a single wallet such as Metamask.

Outside of celo-blockchain, any tools that decode Celo transactions from RLP would need to add support for eth-compatible transactions.  With JSON it may be necessary depending on the language and libraries used.

There isn't a CIP yet, but we wanted to bring it up in order to start hearing everyone's thoughts.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/783326878806048819/808424397991444550/metamask.png","upVoteParrot (11)"

What can change is the actual amount of gas used.  If the transaction uses less gas than its gas limit, then the fee in the end will be based on the gas used rather than the gas limit.

"456226577798135808","Deleted User","30/07/2021 1:22 am","@Mariano | cLabs @Joshua @victorgraf I've been looking at Tim Roughgarden's paper on EIP1-1559, and a few things have jumped out so far in relation to the idea of increasing Celo's target density from 0.5 to 0.75 or 0.8 or something in that vicinity:
(a) Our GPM adjustment calculation is different from theirs in terms of what the adjustment factor means.  In Ethereum the delta is relative to the gas target, while in our GPM contract the delta is relative to the gas maximum.  So, say the target density is `d` and the adjustment speed fraction is `s`, the maximum **upward** change in GPM (i.e. the change after a full block) for us would be `s(1-d)` while for Ethereum it would be `s(1/d-1)`.  In particular, with the parameters as is, it's `0.5(1-0.5) = 0.25` for us and `1/8*(2-1) = 0.125` for Ethereum.  
(b) If we increase to 0.75 and leave the adjustment factor at 0.5, then the maximum GPM increase per block would be `0.5*(1-0.75) = 0.125` which would then match the rate on Ethereum
(c) However, one thing I hadn't thought of before is called out in section 8.6.6. If the target density isn't 0.5, then bigger adjustments in one direction are possible than in the other (e.g. a full block would increase the fee by more than an empty block would decrease it), which makes it possible for a minority of validators to manipulate the base fee in one direction (up if the density is less than 0.5 or down if it's more than 0.5).  For example, with a target density of 0.75, 25% of miners could drive the base fee down by mining empty blocks even if all the other miners' blocks are full.  With a density of 0.8 it'd be 20%, and so on.","",""
"456226577798135808","Deleted User","30/07/2021 1:23 am","I didn't go through all the analysis of miner strategies, so I'm not sure what the implications of this would be, but I thought it was an interesting point we should take into account.  And, another caveat on the above is that perhaps the adjustment speed should be considered in relation to block time (with shorter block times you don't need as big an adjustment per block?  With the ethereum block time more than twice as long as Celo's, would 0.0625 be a closer equivalent for us?)","",""

With your gas price of 1 gwei that means the maximum fee would be 0.01 cUSD, and that would not leave enough in the account for the transfer of 0.02 cUSD, which is why the transaction reverts.  The way it works is first the maximum possible fee is deducted, then it executes the transaction, and then you get refunded for the leftover gas.  But in this case because your gas limit is so high, what gets deducted for the fee doesn't leave the account the 0.02 cUSD necessary for the transfer.  Try setting the gas limit to something more reasonable like 200k gas.  Or pay the fee in CELO instead of in cUSD (since then the fee portion wouldn't affect the balance available for the cUSD transfer), but even then I'd recommend using a reasonable gas limit.  Normally whatever tool you're using should set the limit using gas estimation.  Though the explorer says your fee was in CELO, but I think that's wrong, since those two transfers there are the fees and they say cUSD.","",""

A full node (non elected), the only thing that can't do, is add new blocks to the chain. Both stores the full blockchain data, verifies all new blocks and states, and maintain the state of the blockchain.
We have two different kind of light nodes: light node, and lightest node
The light node basically stores and sync the header chain, which allows that node to verify the validity of the data using the states roots that has in the headers. So, it request anything else if it's needed for specific operations.
The lightest node, takes the advantage that we know that the same validator's set will be the one signing (at least 2/3 +1 of the signatures) each block. So tecnically, instead of retrieving every header, you can just retrieve the epochs changes, where the old validator set, signs the new one for that new epoch, which allows us to ""jump"" that amount of blocks (each epoch ~17k blocks), because you can verify those signatures. After that node reaches the actual epoch, it syncs header by header until being up to date with the blockchain. But as the light node, it does not store the whole blockchain, and will have to retrieve info from the other full nodes for specific requests, and then can verify the validity of the data, with the state roots of the header","","üëç (4)"

PS: the behavior above I got when trying to send CELO to a contract without a `payable` function. Funds being sent from Celo Extension Wallet to a contract.

Does the contract really need to have a payable function or is there any workaround to receive CELO as a ERC20 and not the native token?

It has been a long-outstanding problem in DeFi as how to use stablecoins in consensus. You cannot simply replace ""proof-of-stake"" with ""proof-of-stablecoin-deposit"" due to security implications.

However, this is a much desired feature as it creates continuous built-in demand for the stablecoin, boosting liquidity, increasing price of the crypto-collateral and making things more stable overall. On top of this, it is the first time in history that we can have a decentralised provision of a risk-free interest rate (not by a Central Bank). 

The importance of a decentralised risk-free rate has been overlooked thus far. In our modern economy, it is foundational to our fractional reserve system, as a means to regulate the amount of debt. This can possibly be an avenue towards fractional reserve ontop of stablecoins, a massive boost in adoption (can finally potentially do mortgages, and large loans of stablecoins).

My co-founder and I at Cambridge Cryptographic have a solution outlined here (would love to chat with researchers/developers at Celo more):

However, the `bind` module as it stands does not offer the utilities to create ""Transactors"" (`TransactOpts`) that features these chainIds.

So, you can do a lot from there. (These are random ideas) Cron job activating every of your users account (this would require a server or something). Maybe deploy a contract were everyone of your users vote and then saves their group+account to be activated, but then as part of the same call, activate someones else. Or even having a contract where you save group+account, and gave other users a little incentive to active other votes.

I want to find out if anyone would be interested in joining a Dapp project for a new social media platform.¬†


The social media platform is aimed at removing the censorship existing in present day social media outfits and¬† forestall the indirect user data thefts or if you may, user data exploitation by the above mentioned that translates into billions of dollars in few privileged pockets.


Restore true privacy and data control back to the owners of the data (the users) through decentralisation. And allow Users to benefit from their own data first hand without a 3rd party. Overall create a society where genuine positive social reputation score is incentivized for public good.


If that sounds like anything interesting or intriguing to you. If you are curious how that can be the new normal in the social media space. Then join the team that will make it happen. The team has room for a cross section development experience. No matter your level of expertise...We can use your input on the team. What is really important is your commitment to the goals of the project.


If you are interested, reply to this msg.

Do state your area of development experience and your motivation.


More information about the project would be communicated to the team when formed.

If your node is synced, it means that is already part of the network. For example you can check the amount of peers that you are connected. Another thing that you can do, is to check the amount of txs that you have in your tx_pool.
The dapps using our lightest client (for example valora can switch it to use it, instead of forno) will require and use peered fullnodes. Right now, the fullnodes incentives are not set, we are still investigating the best solution for that, but it will take some time to have that defined.","",""

You can limit which things could be used from the rpc calls using the flag `--rpcapi=<...>` to limit which things could be access from outside.
For example, forno just shows these services `--rpcapi=eth,net,rpc,web3`. If you allow everyone to use, for example, `personal`, in the window of time where you are unlocking your account, another user could use it. Or if you let them access to your `admin` module could be a problem.
You can administrate all the other modules attaching yourself to the `.ipc` file, that you will be the only one that will have access to.
So, yes, you can make it public, but be completely aware of the modules you are listing for the outside, and avoid to store keys on it. Also you should probably check if the rate limit you are experiencing is only from your flow, or someone else is using it (a bot or whatever), in that case, if the performance of your node is being affected, you could think of a more robust solution using a VPN or something else.","","üëç (2)"
"652074546341347328","javi.eth","14/12/2021 9:29 pm","Another option you may explore is restrict incoming traffic to your node using a firewall or security groups. Personally I'd recommend avoid exposing your node publicly if you can. If you need to expose, as ponti said is important not to expose any dangerous api (like `personal`, `admin` or `debug`) because there will be bots looking to ethereum compatible rpc apis. Also it could be valuable using a different port to `8545`. But a general advise, if it can be  exposed just locally, or if you can control network traffic with firewalls or security groups, that brings an extra layer of security (anyway avoid exposing those apis too)","","üíØ (2)"

The main reason you'd want to use SSD is that the read/write latency is much lower. Read latency is important because executing transactions may require arbitrary data from the chain state, which is store on disk (and cached in memory).

"634072389579309056","victorgraf","18/04/2022 2:26 pm","So the way this works is that the blinding factor, this one-time key generated by the client, is only used to blind/""encrypt"" the query that is sent to ODIS. When ODIS responds, the client removes this blinding factor so the final result does not depend on what blinding factor the user chooses (e.g. If users B and C both send the phone number for user A to ODIS, they will use different blindings such that the requests look different, but the result is the same: user A's pepper).

Another way to put this is that the overall protocol implements a keyed PRF/""hash function"" `F(k, m)` where `k` is the secret key held by ODIS and `m` is the message held by the client. In this protocol, the client learns the output of `F(k, m)` but learns nothing about the secret key. The server(s) learn nothing about the message. The blinding factor is what ensures that the server learns nothing about the input message. You'll notice here that the function output only depends on the ODIS secret key and the message, in particular the blinding factor has no influence on the output. As a result, multiple clients that use their own random blinding factors will all get the same result.","","üôè (2),üëç (1)"

In your explanation, you used F(k,m) where k is the secret key held by ODIS and m is the message held by the client. This was clear. What is the result of this F function? The pepper of a user, correct? Also,  I understood that k never changes, correct? 
What I still could not understand is how different messages m and m‚Äô will both produce the same result. Because if users B and C both send the phone number for user A to ODIS They will produce different messages, let‚Äôs say m and m‚Äô. Are you saying that F(k,m) will produce the same result that F(k,m‚Äô)? What is wrong with my thought?","",""
"634072389579309056","victorgraf","19/04/2022 1:34 am","> What is the result of this F function? The pepper of a user, correct?
Correct, this is the ODIS OPRF function and the result is the pepper when the input is a phone number. And correct, k does not change, it is the key shared among ODIS nodes.
> Are you saying that F(k,m) will produce the same result that F(k,m‚Äô)? What is wrong with my thought?
So in this case F is the logical function that is actually split across the client and server. If the phone number is the same for users B and C then m is that phone number and is the same for both clients. They will blind it using their own secret values, so the server will see different blinded messages, but the underlying message will be the same in both cases.","",""

Supposing again users B and C both sending the phone number for user A.
You said they will send to the server different messages (this is clear, because they used different client encryption). Supposing Mb and Mc.

Adding a waiting period of a few blocks, where the app commits to using a randomness value N blocks before it is produced, addresses this issue. As an example, the attestation service [1]  uses a 4 block waiting period (i.e. N=4). Using a higher value gives you a higher degree of protection at the cost of a higher waiting time. Based on my analysis 3-6 blocks is a good range to choose from.

I deployed an upgradeable ERC20 token. The Celo Explorer automatically noticed it was an ERC20 token and indexed it under its name and symbol.

Caller sends in sum(amount) along with recipient information, contract handles doing the transfers in a for-loop.

You won't save that much gas compared to just doing individual transfers.

I have strong experience in Full Stack and Blockchain Development focusing on developing functional, beautiful, dynamic Websites especially web3 dApps in crypto space.
My major strength in Frontend Development is React and Vue.js - deep understandings in functional component and class component, lifecycles and hooks and can combine them efficiently.
Regarding the Backend, I love Node.js.
I've developed many websites using MERN stack, Vue.js and Laravel, and created many bots and apis using Django REST framework and python language.
I also have decent experience with solidity smart contract development on EVM compatible networks.
I always keep clean, tidy, easily readable, and maintainable code for delivery and this always helped me to succeed in every job.

The contractKit basically acts as an interceptor that checks if it knows how to sign a request, otherwise it forwards the request to the node, which, could know how to sign it (you could be running your own node, and unlocking the account which will be able to sign the tx)
In your case, as far as I understand, you are trying to use it locally. So, there are two options

"690687170997911562","pontigaston","29/09/2022 7:36 pm","Ok, a few things:
1) the kit already has a web3 instance, so you can use that instead
2) Use the CK to know the address of our contracts, this way, instead of having a fixed address, if you switch between alfajores/baklava/mainnet, the same kit will give you the actual address without issues
3) the `landTokenContract` is probably using some other instance of web3 to create that contract instance. I bet that that's your issue.
As you are using an instance that don't have the logic to intercept the request, basically, you are adding a privateKey to the kit, but all the calls happen in a different instance

So, try something like this:

```
const kit = newKit(""https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org"");
kit.defaultAccount = process.env.DEV_ADDRESS;
kit.connection.addAccount(process.env.DEV_PRIVATE_KEY);

await kit.setFeeCurrency(CeloContract.StableToken) // this is an async one, so it should be added in an async func, for exmale, in the addNewInvestment. I'm just adding this here to point you the better way to set the currency, the 2) point

I'm not saying that the adoption of wallets are not an issue, but it has a lot of technical knowledge that maybe, is not the key of your product. And, in this case, where the user is in charge of their keys, they need to trust that you are handling those keys as secure as you can. Otherwise, a bug, a hack, or something aiming to get the user keys from your dapp, will break your users trust in you. That's why I think the majority, kicks that problem to a second party.
Also, think the future of that decision too. If your app, starts to be really used and your users actually start to know more about the ecosystem and wants to use different other dapps. Are you going to act as a wallet and allow other dapps to connect with you? (which requires again, more time and resources from your end)

So, yes, technically, the cUSD *shouldn't* change. But is possible also to change the Registry's address of the cUSD proxy. But that's kind of a catastrophic scenario, hahaha.
The Registry, is the one who stores the addresses of the proxies of the core contracts. I recommend you to use the Registry, and avoid fixing addresses to your code.
One advantage of it, is that there is a Registry in all of celo's networks (all of them in the address `0x000...00ce10` ""celo"", set from the genesis). So, it you dapps uses the registry to retrieve the cUSD proxy address, your dapp will work for every network (you will only need to change the url of the node of the network that you want). So it's kind of easier to switch between a staging environment to a production one, without dragging bugs.","","ü§Ø (1)"

However it fails at the `make geth-musl` step of the image build. Are there missing dependencies that need to be added first? I _can_ get it to build by swapping out the `golang` builder with `ubuntu:jammy` and installing go myself manually like this:
 ```
FROM arm64v8/ubuntu:jammy as builder

RUN apt update && apt install gcc make musl-dev wget -y

RUN wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.2.linux-arm64.tar.gz

ENV PATH $PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

So the Uniswap `SwapRouter` deployed is the version 2 SwapRouter. The difference between the first and second version is a ""deadline"" timestamp field is no longer specified in V2. 

I got tripped up because the field is still specified in the package from the example (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/v3-periphery) and only V1 routers are listed here (https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/reference/deployments) EXCEPT for the Celo SwapRouter which IS the V2. Thats why the example works on all the other chains because it references all the V1 contracts and Celo ONLY has V2 contracts. 

Solution for now is to not use the `ISwapRouter.sol` in the periphery package and to import a local version of the `ISwapRouter02.sol` contract into your project. Hopefully this saves other folks time : )","","‚ù§Ô∏è (1)"

"683052211076464733","nvillegase","25/02/2023 4:22 am","Hello everyone! I'm seeking for recommendations. We're building a project in which we have a reserve of productive assets that serve as a collateral for a stable-coin. Those assets produce income over time, and we will implement a governance system in which our users will be able to decide how to allocate the reserve's income, which will acquire new assets to be included into this reserve.

Furthermore, we're thinking that this governance system should provide a list of the assets that *could* be funded, and that the governance goal is to decide what percentages of the accumulated income to allocate to different specific assets.

What technical considerations would you take into account building this feature?

Concerns we have:
 - We don't want to deploy a token 'just' for governance, but rather we want that the same stable-coin that is collateralized by the reserve can be used as governance token for this specific purpose. We think that using a governance token 'in parallel' would deviate the attention of our users to this token, and not the 'reserve' token which is the want we want to massify.
 - We don't want that, in order to vote, you have to stake your coins.

Thanks for any input you may have!

"690687170997911562","pontigaston","25/05/2023 6:42 pm","@zambogami this is an expected behaviour. The extraData field has the `IstanbulAggregatedSeal` which has the signatures of the validators that signed the block that the actual validator ""got"".
So, in every block, every validator will get consensus on the block when they reach 2/3+1 of signatures then, they will wait a short period, to retrieve more signatures from the other 1/3-1 validators. But that block is already valid. We wait a little to collect the majority of signatures possible for our uptime score mechanism, BUT it's impossible for us, to have every block with the same signatures each (if we had to address that we would need to reach consensus on those signatures which is an unnecessary cost). So we have an scenario, when the same block, could have different signatures (each of the block will have more than 2/3+1 of the signatures, but not necessary the same ones). As an example, if you have 4 validators, you can have the same valid block with the signatures 1,2,3 or 2,3,4 or 1,3,4 or 1,2,4, or even 1,2,3,4.
This is why we need the ParentSealBitmap, because for the uptime score, we will need to have all the validators in the same page to be able to calculate the same uptimeScore. Which means that the Proposer of the block N+1, will use the seal that that validator has in its N block, to save its bitmap, which then, all the validators will use.
So, TL;DR, it's an expected behaviour.","","üëç (1)"

Currently, the archive data is not that large, so the time difference between syncing from scratch and using backup data is not that significant. However, I want to prepare for the case where the data becomes larger.

Can you check if it is possible to use a copied exisitng data directory? I'm asking because when running an RPC node in Celo, I entered the account address and each node has different account address. So I'm wondering because of that that the backup data is not compatible.","",""

Could you help us understand how celocli creates keys on the ledger? We are a bit confused about this process.

When we use the ""celocli account:list --useLedger --ledgerAddresses 5"" command, we get these addresses:

'0x4e8C3050D517d7337ECcb670c66312bFEB499445',
'0xf8e1B7F0964a0866b4fdd9BFFe7C9604B34cC0ee',

'0x0C6fa8eD0186f813Ae8B219eC1fCa4d7E3AFC6Cd',
'0x1717D932e8851e9be4ef4859CD72032199063AA2'

However, when we try to access the ledger keys in Metamask, we get different addresses both when importing the ledger recovery phrase and when connecting to the ledger one by one.

The addresses that Metamask shows are:

0xc1B5324657503d6af063E1A42230740b0A51Dc00
0xe508181a88D8457EDcF125259bcD79df9018fc83

0x547BF5d014e5CA7228b26CDa3416C0A39ccfa62b

Could you help us understand why the addresses do not match?

We would greatly appreciate any help you can provide.

Thank you!
