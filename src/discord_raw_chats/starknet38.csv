I have updated the contracts to make full use of acounts contracts and argent X. This means that for every transaction, your tx has to go through an account contract; these usually have a nonce. This nonce is ifferent at every tx, and so you'll never get the same hash twice.

It's really great to have you on board. Cairo is not that hard to learn and a promising skill in your toolbox. This tutorial will show you how to write and implement a StarkNet contract: 

https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html 

and https://starknet.io/recorded-tutorials/ 

Cairo was specifically designed to be efficient within STARK, which is the cryptography that Starknet uses to make computations cheap. You can read more about Cairo here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/ and https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/

Shameless plug, if you want to learn more about solidity and smart contracts in general, I have just published this https://twitter.com/HenriLieutaud/status/1488163683863867397
But if you are used to using DEFI apps and are somewhat familiar with Smart Contracts, you can go straight to Cairo. My sugestion would be to find a fun/interesting project you want to build, and roll with it.

the team is working on full decentralization, but not from day one.

You can not run a StarkNet full node yet. We're currently developing the Constellations phase of StarkNet (see the planned roadmap here: https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880). In this phase we have one sequencer. A full node is currently being developed (but note that it's not a sequencer, it just follows the state of the network rather than adding to it). In the Universe phase, we'll finally move to the multiple-sequencers mode and then you (that is, anyone  ) will be able to fully participate in running the network.

You can also read more about the decentralization plan and roadmap here:

In general for this exercise I solved it with setting some user values like 1,2,3,4,5 with the `set_user_values`  write function and then using the `user_values`  read function to figure out which value is assigned to which slot. So for an array of e.g 1,2,3,4,5 you can find out what is assigned to slot 0 - can be 1 or 5. Then you get an idea how the array should look like so that `assert user_value_at_slot_ten = 10`  will not throw an error.","",""

When the data are registered in the contract, I use a recursive function. This function basically flips the array. There are a 100 values, and basically value 100 is stored at 0, etc.
So if your slot is 34, you should look at value (100-34) = 66

- create a new ERC721 with metadata contract, using the provided one as a base contract to inherit from (even a copy of `TDERC721_metadata` should work?)
- deploy it
- mint a new NFT in this new contract
- update with metadata URI??? or should I just keep the base URI??

I know that with Reed-Solomon error coding, we’re transforming a polynomial from a smaller message space `m(x)`, into a larger codeword space `c(x)` where `c(x)` contains both valid and invalid polynomials. There’s always a low degree, generator polynomial `g(x)` that can generate all valid codewords/polynomials in `c(x)`.

How does this mental model map onto FRI? This is where I’m not able to make the connection.

Is the verifier just recursively deconstructing the prover’s execution polynomial `f(x)` into a linear combination of smaller polynomials, i.e. `m(x)`'s? Is `f(x)` like the `c(x)` in this case? 

Are we just trying to get to a “low enough” degree `d` of `g(x)` so that we can just check `d+1` values from the polynomial commitment table?

From my understanding you have a list of `(key: felt, value: felt)` and you need to compute the cumulative sum of the values from the same key so if you have a list that looks like that `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 4)]` you'd have a dict before squashing that would look like that:
```md
| KEY  | PREV | NEXT |

| 1    | 6    | 15   |

I'm on a fresh install of Ubuntu, and there seem to have been some steps that were just assumed and were missing from the documentation that I had to figure out myself. It might save newcomers some time if these were in the documentation!

1. Prior to the first step, install the following (all needed, and note 3.9 is latest Python but I'm using 3.7 for consistency):

sudo apt install -y python3.7 python3.7-venv python3.7-dev libgmp3-dev gcc

Note that libgmp3-dev was mentioned in the docs but not any of the others. I put it all in one line.

2. Once you're inside the Python venv, you need to install the 'wheel' package prior to the other three (also not mentioned in the docs):

pip3 install **wheel** ecdsa fastecdsa sympy

These two changes to the quickstart page would likely save newbs like me at least 20 minutes of head scratching! Just suggestions 🙂 

P.S. here are the salient errors I fixed with the above, in case anyone is searching for them here in Discord 🙂 

* The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available.
* error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'

It's really great to have you on board. Cairo is not that hard to learn and a promising skill in your toolbox. I can list you some tutorials and open-source resources: 

https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html 

and https://starknet.io/recorded-tutorials/ 

Henri's new tutorial:
https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-cairo-101
and
https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-erc721

and 

https://symbonstark.surge.sh/#/

Cairo was specifically designed to be efficient within STARK, which is the cryptography that Starknet uses to make computations cheap. You can read more about Cairo here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/ and https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/

When you master Cairo, come to our discord to the channel community-jobs, write a short summary of your skills and we will hook you up.

"330737541257101312","gaetbout","31/03/2022 2:25 pm","Hi, 
In the last exercise (ex18) of ERC20 the method tries to directly *withdraw_all_tokens* and then it asserts that what is withdrawn > 0.
It assumes that it still has the tokens  deposited in the previous exercise. Which makes those two exercise very coupled.
In my case I do exercise by exercise.
So I had to redeploy a new contract which will be blank of data... (I'll have to make a method to ""manually"" increase the tokens of the evaluator contract, since I can't call ex16_17 again).
Is it done on purpose?
If not I'd assume it should first deposit a  certain amount of token and do some more check.
If someone tells me it shouldn't behave like that I'd gladly make a PR to fix it!","",""

ValueError: Memory value must be an int, not float64.

 - with pen and paper I would say that the derivative is > 0 for all x and that f(-2) < 0 < f(0) so there should be a solution but I don't know how to write this neither with cairo

`%builtins output
from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word
# Computes base^exp.
func pow(base : felt, exp : felt) -> (res):
    if exp == 0:
        return (res=1)
    end
    let (res) = pow(base=base, exp=exp - 1)
    return (res=res * base)
end

func main{output_ptr : felt*}():
    serialize_word(1 + 100)
    # Add your code here.
    let (res) = pow(10, 74)
    return ()
end`

This returns errors. However, if I add `{output_ptr : felt*}` to `func pow`, then it runs fine:

`%builtins output
from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word
# Computes base^exp.
func pow{output_ptr : felt*}(base : felt, exp : felt) -> (res):
    if exp == 0:
        return (res=1)
    end
    let (res) = pow(base=base, exp=exp - 1)
    return (res=res * base)
end

func main{output_ptr : felt*}():
    serialize_word(1 + 100)
    # Add your code here.
    let (res) = pow(10, 74)
    return ()
end`

Or, the code also runs fine if I remove the line `serialize_word(1 + 100)` inside `func main` (and `func pow` does not need the implicit argument `output_ptr` in this case).

I don't understand why `func pow` needs `{output_ptr : felt*}` since `serialize_word` is called only in `func main`. Any thoughts? Thx 😊","",""

Is there anyway to port the settings from ArgentX to my  `~/.starknet_accounts/`?

I can paste priv key and address, but the public address isn't shown anywhere. I tried using  key generation library for js that would give me public key from private key but it fails each time on the private keys from ArgentX. Not sure if there are any modifications to BIP32 key derivation over what etherum is using.


Either way I managed to submit invocation with this syntax:

```starknet-erc20 chavka$ starknet invoke  --address 0x05bf05eece944b360ff0098eb9288e49bd0007e5a9ed80aefcb740e680e67ea4  --abi artifacts/abis/Evaluator.json    --function ex4_5_6_test_fencing  --network alpha-goerli  --max_fee 10```

But, it didn't reject it and it's allegedly up until 1h for it to be shown on Voyager, which doesn't help me with not being able to easily debug erc20/erc721 tutorials.

My problem is that when logic doesn't work out and it doesn't let me sign it, I don't have any clue of what line is causing it and i need to resort to visually inspecting everything and trying to find it. That's straightforward to debug for single functionality being added at a time, but `ex4_5_6_test_fencing` has a lot of changes at once, and I have no idea at which point it fails.

Is there a wallet/cli method that would allow me either submit transaction that would fail or at least show me at which line it failed?","",""

I have a remark concerning the  starknet-edu /starknet-erc20, exercices 15 & 16 :
In the evaluator code ( https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc20/blob/main/contracts/Evaluator.cairo ), in exercise 15, line 559, we have : 
`let (total_custody) = IExerciseSolution.deposit_tokens(
        contract_address=submitted_exercise_address, amount=ten_tokens_uint256
    )`
In exercise 16, line 621, we have :
`IExerciseSolution.deposit_tokens(
        contract_address=submitted_exercise_address, amount=ten_tokens_uint256
    )`
In the same cairo file, we have 2 calls of the same function, that one time return a value, and later return no value.🤔 
According to https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc20/blob/main/contracts/IExerciseSolution.cairo , only the first case is conform to the interface file.
But it's not a problem for the compilator (no compilation failure of Evaluator.cairo).🤔 
Is it normal that the compilator accept a call of function that is not conform to interface file?
For Exercise 16, if I create a deposit_tokens function conform to the interface file, compilation and execution of validator.ex16_17_deposit_and_mint is correct.
But if I create a deposit_tokens function conform to the code of line 621 of Evaluator, the compilation is made without error, but the invoke of validator.ex6_17_deposit_and_mint generate a failure.
It seems that the compilator is too permissive for call of functions of external contract...😢","",""

> You may have noticed that we’ve used recursion in the code above rather than the loop structure you may have expected. The main reason for this is that the Cairo memory is immutable – once you write the value of a memory cell, this cell cannot change in the future. This is similar to pure functional languages, whose objects are also immutable, where you also have to replace loops with recursion for the same reason.

My `evaluator_expected_balance` is `dummy_token_init_balance` minus `registration_price` = `308000000000000000246`

So `dummy_token_end_balance` have to be `308000000000000000246`, but i have `616000000000000000492`
I've tried to decrease Evaluator balance by `transferFrom` in Dummy ERC20 token https://goerli.voyager.online/contract/0x25dd23fa28df0658219131c6fdefe5bd3b26456935bff9872a82aaa482ceaea
> but i have an Error: *AssertionError: assert_not_zero failed: 0 = 0.*

I re-deploy contract with `registration_price` `616000000000000000492` but still have an error: `Actual registration cost is not the one returned by registration_price`

Any clues guys?)","",""

the arguments i am passing in the constructor of the solitidy contract are
```
STARKNET_CORE = 0xde29d060D45901Fb19ED6C6e959EB22d8626708e
L2_EVALUATOR = 0x02fae5fa0550dd364180fa13f9adbb3253ccc37cb35c314540ad1cf398798c84

```
(these are the variables i have in a python notebook--there is an automatic conversion of hex to integer that i then use for l2_evaluator and just copy and paste the starknet_core address manually. i just double checked that the integers map to the hex addresses.)
(i tried both evaluator contracts as that was the issue with my troubles with exercise 0)

and I got my selector value by doing

```
from starkware.starknet.compiler.compile import get_selector_from_name
SELECTOR_NAME = get_selector_from_name(""ex2"")
```

I deployed two solidity contracts instantiated with different l2 evaluators. I've called the method on the contract and waited an hour or so before checking the `has_validated_exercise` read method on both contracts, where they both return a zero.

You can see the message log of my latest attempt here: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xec3c3a6f9895b3f115b2b0d38917751a7e459a886b69f13f401b91462e100f0a#eventlog

Is there a way to track the l1->l2 message flow for errors? Is my method of deriving the selector incorrect? Appreciate the space to air out some thoughts 🙂","",""

1. at line 99 it says that when `length = 0` it starts summing, but I don’t see any sum `within if(length == 0)` statement, as it also is referring at line 101

2. at line 106 I’d like to better know what `array=array + 1` is doing, trying to know how it makes sense in the logic

3. also at line 109, it’s previously said that line is reached only when `length=0`, if that’s the case then `length - 1` would be -1 at that time, how it makes sense to pass -1 as length to save into `user_values_storage`?","",""

"981356123657494548","whatthedev","13/11/2022 5:09 am","1. When `length = 0`, this initiates the first `return ()` from the call on line 106. Upon return, we're back to `length = 1`. And then we proceed to line 109 for the first time to begin to fill the array. 

3. The comment on line 108 would better read `# This part of the function is first reached AFTER RETURN FROM length=0.` (because now we are back to `length = 1`)

2. I think you mean line 106. To see the logic, suppose for example that when `func set_user_values_internal` is called in line 85, we begin with `length` = 5 and `array` = 0 (a pointer to the first storage address of `array`)--just making up two numbers to use. The first time we reach line 106, this call reduces `length` to 4 and increases `array` to 1. 

Then we keep hitting line 106 until `length` has been reduced to 0, and `array` has been increased to 5. This initiates the first return (answer 1 above). Upon this first return, the values are back to `length` = 1, and `array` = 4 (which is the pointer to the last storage address of `array`). So, the first time line 109 is reached it is: `user_values_storage.write(account, 0, [4])`. This stores the last member of `array` (`[4]`) in slot 0 of  `user_value_storage`.

Then the next return (again from call at line 106) gets us to `length` = 2 and `array` = 3. So the next write on line 109 stores the next-to-last member of `array` (`[3]`) in slot 1.

And so on, until the final write stores the first member of `array` (`[0]`) in slot 4. Hope that helps!","","✅ (1)"

The script uses Argent X with a backup.json file that does not look like it can be generated anymore with V3. So I took apart the code since I figured you can use Argent X by updating and following the logic in the script to migrate my points.

So, I wrote and deployed a contract that completes exercise 14, then migrates those points using the invoked methods in the migration script. Problem is, it is telling me there aren't any points to migrate! I looked into the token address that the migration contract is using:

0x74002c7df47096f490a1a89b086b8a468f2e7c686e04a024d93b7c59f934f83

That is not the contract that is the token address which holds our balance for cairo 101. This is:

0x05c6b1379f1d4c8a4f5db781a706b63a885f3f9570f7863629e99e2342ac344c

I'm trying to solve the ex14 from https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-cairo-101:
I managed to compile, declare and deploy my contract, however I have errors when I'm trying to interact with its external functions (be it through the CLI or via block explorers).

Attached are the logs of the errors I'm getting when trying to invoke my `claim_points_on_ex14` external function. Error logs when trying to invoke my other external function are similar.
Unfortunately, I must admit that I am clueless as to where these errors are pointing to :/

You can find the my contract's code here: https://github.com/0xKubitus/starknet-cairo-101/blob/exercise14-by-Kubitus/src/myex14solution.cairo

I'm currently trying to follow the replay from the last Basecamp session (about tests in Cairo1 - link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f1u1vMNNh0&t=1900s) but I get an error message when trying to run the very first test... 😢

Please allow me to describe you the context and my issue:","",""
"422402982533922819","0xkubi.stark","08/05/2023 6:38 pm","1) I have initialized my project using Scarb.
2) I have created an `ERC20.cairo` file in the `src/` folder.
3) In `ERC20.cairo`, I have copied/pasted the content from Starkware's ERC20 implementation example (https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/main/crates/cairo-lang-starknet/test_data/erc20.cairo).
4) I added a `tests` module, including a `test_constructor` function, exactly like Robert did (see here for his function: https://www.youtube.com/live/6f1u1vMNNh0?feature=share&t=3207).
5) I added: `mod ERC20;` in `lib.cairo`.
6) I created and implemented the `cairo_project_toml file`, just like Robert does in the replay from live coding session.

Now, when I run: `cairo-test --starknet .` (which is the exact same command that Robert runs in his terminal) I get the following error message:
```

Unfortunately, I don't understand how come I get this: ""Method is_zero not found"" error when I'm copy/pasting the official ERC20 contract template from Starkware and implementing the same test than Robert... 
I do assume the error obviously comes from me but I tried several times and always end up with the same error...
I can't see what I'm doing wrong here...  Would anyone be so kind to give me some help, please?

(here's my repo if you wanna take a look at my code ->  https://github.com/0xKubitus/cairo1-tests-workshop/tree/following-basecamp-session4-replay)


P.S: Running `scarb --version` in my terminal returns:
```
scarb 0.2.0-alpha.0 (04eb95172 2023-04-13)
