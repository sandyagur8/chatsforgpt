It's really great to have you on board. Cairo is not that hard to learn and a promising skill in your toolbox. This tutorial will show you how to write and implement a StarkNet contract: 

https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html 

and https://starknet.io/recorded-tutorials/ 

Cairo was specifically designed to be efficient within STARK, which is the cryptography that Starknet uses to make computations cheap. You can read more about Cairo here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/ and https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/

So my guess is you'll be fine. 
Shameless plug, if you want to learn more about solidity and smart contracts in general, I have just published this https://twitter.com/HenriLieutaud/status/1488163683863867397
But if you are used to using DEFI apps and are somewhat familiar with Smart Contracts, you can go straight to Cairo. My sugestion would be to find a fun/interesting project you want to build, and roll with it.

the team is working on full decentralization, but not from day one.

You can not run a StarkNet full node yet. We're currently developing the Constellations phase of StarkNet (see the planned roadmap here: https://medium.com/starkware/on-the-road-to-starknet-a-permissionless-stark-powered-l2-zk-rollup-83be53640880). In this phase we have one sequencer. A full node is currently being developed (but note that it's not a sequencer, it just follows the state of the network rather than adding to it). In the Universe phase, we'll finally move to the multiple-sequencers mode and then you (that is, anyone  ) will be able to fully participate in running the network.

You can also read more about the decentralization plan and roadmap here:

In general for this exercise I solved it with setting some user values like 1,2,3,4,5 with the `set_user_values`  write function and then using the `user_values`  read function to figure out which value is assigned to which slot. So for an array of e.g 1,2,3,4,5 you can find out what is assigned to slot 0 - can be 1 or 5. Then you get an idea how the array should look like so that `assert user_value_at_slot_ten = 10`  will not throw an error.","",""

When the data are registered in the contract, I use a recursive function. This function basically flips the array. There are a 100 values, and basically value 100 is stored at 0, etc.

- create a new ERC721 with metadata contract, using the provided one as a base contract to inherit from (even a copy of `TDERC721_metadata` should work?)
- deploy it
- mint a new NFT in this new contract
- update with metadata URI??? or should I just keep the base URI??

I know that with Reed-Solomon error coding, we‚Äôre transforming a polynomial from a smaller message space `m(x)`, into a larger codeword space `c(x)` where `c(x)` contains both valid and invalid polynomials. There‚Äôs always a low degree, generator polynomial `g(x)` that can generate all valid codewords/polynomials in `c(x)`.

How does this mental model map onto FRI? This is where I‚Äôm not able to make the connection.

Is the verifier just recursively deconstructing the prover‚Äôs execution polynomial `f(x)` into a linear combination of smaller polynomials, i.e. `m(x)`'s? Is `f(x)` like the `c(x)` in this case? 

Are we just trying to get to a ‚Äúlow enough‚Äù degree `d` of `g(x)` so that we can just check `d+1` values from the polynomial commitment table?

So the compiler will jump in memory to get 23 and lose reference of ap. In your second line I assume that  23 is the last element to compute so he do not need to track [ap -1].

From my understanding you have a list of `(key: felt, value: felt)` and you need to compute the cumulative sum of the values from the same key so if you have a list that looks like that `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 4)]` you'd have a dict before squashing that would look like that:
```md
| KEY  | PREV | NEXT |

| 1    | 6    | 15   |

then you'd have to squash it to obtain:

I'm on a fresh install of Ubuntu, and there seem to have been some steps that were just assumed and were missing from the documentation that I had to figure out myself. It might save newcomers some time if these were in the documentation!

1. Prior to the first step, install the following (all needed, and note 3.9 is latest Python but I'm using 3.7 for consistency):

sudo apt install -y python3.7 python3.7-venv python3.7-dev libgmp3-dev gcc

Note that libgmp3-dev was mentioned in the docs but not any of the others. I put it all in one line.

2. Once you're inside the Python venv, you need to install the 'wheel' package prior to the other three (also not mentioned in the docs):

pip3 install **wheel** ecdsa fastecdsa sympy

These two changes to the quickstart page would likely save newbs like me at least 20 minutes of head scratching! Just suggestions üôÇ 

P.S. here are the salient errors I fixed with the above, in case anyone is searching for them here in Discord üôÇ 

* The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not

It's really great to have you on board. Cairo is not that hard to learn and a promising skill in your toolbox. I can list you some tutorials and open-source resources: 

https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/index.html 

and https://starknet.io/recorded-tutorials/ 

Henri's new tutorial:
https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-cairo-101
and
https://github.com/l-henri/starknet-erc721

and 

https://symbonstark.surge.sh/#/

Cairo was specifically designed to be efficient within STARK, which is the cryptography that Starknet uses to make computations cheap. You can read more about Cairo here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/ and https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/

When you master Cairo, come to our discord to the channel community-jobs, write a short summary of your skills and we will hook you up.

Do you have more abstracted documentation available?

I have checked a lot of docs and information is really scattered, which makes it hard to follow through all these stuff

By default in cairo 1, 2, 3, 42, 69 are  felt . 
Uint256(1,0)  will create a number on 256 bits that is 1
It is encoded in 2 parts  (low and high) 128 bits each

In the last exercise (ex18) of ERC20 the method tries to directly *withdraw_all_tokens* and then it asserts that what is withdrawn > 0.
It assumes that it still has the tokens  deposited in the previous exercise. Which makes those two exercise very coupled.
In my case I do exercise by exercise.
So I had to redeploy a new contract which will be blank of data... (I'll have to make a method to ""manually"" increase the tokens of the evaluator contract, since I can't call ex16_17 again).
Is it done on purpose?
If not I'd assume it should first deposit a  certain amount of token and do some more check.
If someone tells me it shouldn't behave like that I'd gladly make a PR to fix it!","",""

`%builtins output
from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word
# Computes base^exp.
func pow(base : felt, exp : felt) -> (res):
    if exp == 0:
        return (res=1)

    let (res) = pow(base=base, exp=exp - 1)
    return (res=res * base)
end

func main{output_ptr : felt*}():
    serialize_word(1 + 100)
    # Add your code here.
    let (res) = pow(10, 74)
    return ()
end`

This returns errors. However, if I add `{output_ptr : felt*}` to `func pow`, then it runs fine:

`%builtins output
from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word
# Computes base^exp.
func pow{output_ptr : felt*}(base : felt, exp : felt) -> (res):
    if exp == 0:
        return (res=1)
    end
    let (res) = pow(base=base, exp=exp - 1)

end

func main{output_ptr : felt*}():
    serialize_word(1 + 100)
    # Add your code here.
    let (res) = pow(10, 74)
    return ()
end`

Or, the code also runs fine if I remove the line `serialize_word(1 + 100)` inside `func main` (and `func pow` does not need the implicit argument `output_ptr` in this case).

I don't understand why `func pow` needs `{output_ptr : felt*}` since `serialize_word` is called only in `func main`. Any thoughts? Thx üòä","",""

Is there anyway to port the settings from ArgentX to my  `~/.starknet_accounts/`?

I can paste priv key and address, but the public address isn't shown anywhere. I tried using  key generation library for js that would give me public key from private key but it fails each time on the private keys from ArgentX. Not sure if there are any modifications to BIP32 key derivation over what etherum is using.


Either way I managed to submit invocation with this syntax:

```starknet-erc20 chavka$ starknet invoke  --address 0x05bf05eece944b360ff0098eb9288e49bd0007e5a9ed80aefcb740e680e67ea4  --abi artifacts/abis/Evaluator.json    --function ex4_5_6_test_fencing  --network alpha-goerli  --max_fee 10```

But, it didn't reject it and it's allegedly up until 1h for it to be shown on Voyager, which doesn't help me with not being able to easily debug erc20/erc721 tutorials.

My problem is that when logic doesn't work out and it doesn't let me sign it, I don't have any clue of what line is causing it and i need to resort to visually inspecting everything and trying to find it. That's straightforward to debug for single functionality being added at a time, but `ex4_5_6_test_fencing` has a lot of changes at once, and I have no idea at which point it fails.

Is there a wallet/cli method that would allow me either submit transaction that would fail or at least show me at which line it failed?","",""

I have a remark concerning the  starknet-edu /starknet-erc20, exercices 15 & 16 :
In the evaluator code ( https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc20/blob/main/contracts/Evaluator.cairo ), in exercise 15, line 559, we have : 
`let (total_custody) = IExerciseSolution.deposit_tokens(
        contract_address=submitted_exercise_address, amount=ten_tokens_uint256
    )`
In exercise 16, line 621, we have :
`IExerciseSolution.deposit_tokens(
        contract_address=submitted_exercise_address, amount=ten_tokens_uint256
    )`
In the same cairo file, we have 2 calls of the same function, that one time return a value, and later return no value.ü§î 
According to https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc20/blob/main/contracts/IExerciseSolution.cairo , only the first case is conform to the interface file.
But it's not a problem for the compilator (no compilation failure of Evaluator.cairo).ü§î 
Is it normal that the compilator accept a call of function that is not conform to interface file?
For Exercise 16, if I create a deposit_tokens function conform to the interface file, compilation and execution of validator.ex16_17_deposit_and_mint is correct.
But if I create a deposit_tokens function conform to the code of line 621 of Evaluator, the compilation is made without error, but the invoke of validator.ex6_17_deposit_and_mint generate a failure.
It seems that the compilator is too permissive for call of functions of external contract...üò¢","",""

(these are the variables i have in a python notebook--there is an automatic conversion of hex to integer that i then use for l2_evaluator and just copy and paste the starknet_core address manually. i just double checked that the integers map to the hex addresses.)
(i tried both evaluator contracts as that was the issue with my troubles with exercise 0)

and I got my selector value by doing

```
from starkware.starknet.compiler.compile import get_selector_from_name
SELECTOR_NAME = get_selector_from_name(""ex2"")

I deployed two solidity contracts instantiated with different l2 evaluators. I've called the method on the contract and waited an hour or so before checking the `has_validated_exercise` read method on both contracts, where they both return a zero.

You can see the message log of my latest attempt here: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xec3c3a6f9895b3f115b2b0d38917751a7e459a886b69f13f401b91462e100f0a#eventlog

quick update based on my experience : 
to install Python3.9.12 did used pyenv
```brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.9.12```

than used 
```CFLAGS=-I`brew --prefix gmp`/include LDFLAGS=-L`brew --prefix gmp`/lib pip install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy```

3. also at line 109, it‚Äôs previously said that line is reached only when `length=0`, if that‚Äôs the case then `length - 1` would be -1 at that time, how it makes sense to pass -1 as length to save into `user_values_storage`?","",""

"981356123657494548","whatthedev","13/11/2022 5:09 am","1. When `length = 0`, this initiates the first `return ()` from the call on line 106. Upon return, we're back to `length = 1`. And then we proceed to line 109 for the first time to begin to fill the array. 

3. The comment on line 108 would better read `# This part of the function is first reached AFTER RETURN FROM length=0.` (because now we are back to `length = 1`)

2. I think you mean line 106. To see the logic, suppose for example that when `func set_user_values_internal` is called in line 85, we begin with `length` = 5 and `array` = 0 (a pointer to the first storage address of `array`)--just making up two numbers to use. The first time we reach line 106, this call reduces `length` to 4 and increases `array` to 1. 

Then we keep hitting line 106 until `length` has been reduced to 0, and `array` has been increased to 5. This initiates the first return (answer 1 above). Upon this first return, the values are back to `length` = 1, and `array` = 4 (which is the pointer to the last storage address of `array`). So, the first time line 109 is reached it is: `user_values_storage.write(account, 0, [4])`. This stores the last member of `array` (`[4]`) in slot 0 of  `user_value_storage`.

Then the next return (again from call at line 106) gets us to `length` = 2 and `array` = 3. So the next write on line 109 stores the next-to-last member of `array` (`[3]`) in slot 1.

And so on, until the final write stores the first member of `array` (`[0]`) in slot 4. Hope that helps!","","‚úÖ (1)"

The script uses Argent X with a backup.json file that does not look like it can be generated anymore with V3. So I took apart the code since I figured you can use Argent X by updating and following the logic in the script to migrate my points.

So, I wrote and deployed a contract that completes exercise 14, then migrates those points using the invoked methods in the migration script. Problem is, it is telling me there aren't any points to migrate! I looked into the token address that the migration contract is using:

0x74002c7df47096f490a1a89b086b8a468f2e7c686e04a024d93b7c59f934f83

That is not the contract that is the token address which holds our balance for cairo 101. This is:

0x05c6b1379f1d4c8a4f5db781a706b63a885f3f9570f7863629e99e2342ac344c

Anyways, I think I'm out of ways to migrate my points and will just have to take the L. If there's still another way, a sneaky way, that I just need to find... let me know please.","",""

//  Using a simple public contract function
// In this exercise, you need to:
// - Use this contract's claim_points() function
// - Your points are credited by the contract

// What you'll learn
// - General smart contract syntax
// - Calling a function

// General directives and imports
//
//

// Constructor
// This function is called when the contract is deployed
//


// External functions
// These functions are callable by other contracts
//

// This function is called claim_points
// It takes implicit arguments (syscall_ptr : felt*, pedersen_ptr : HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr). Read more about implicit arguments here https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/how_cairo_works/builtins.html
// It defines the expression sender_address as a felt. Read more about felts here https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_cairo/intro.html#field-element

I need your help, please üôè 

I'm trying to solve the ex14 from https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-cairo-101:
I managed to compile, declare and deploy my contract, however I have errors when I'm trying to interact with its external functions (be it through the CLI or via block explorers).

Attached are the logs of the errors I'm getting when trying to invoke my `claim_points_on_ex14` external function. Error logs when trying to invoke my other external function are similar.
Unfortunately, I must admit that I am clueless as to where these errors are pointing to :/

You can find the my contract's code here: https://github.com/0xKubitus/starknet-cairo-101/blob/exercise14-by-Kubitus/src/myex14solution.cairo

2) I have created an `ERC20.cairo` file in the `src/` folder.
3) In `ERC20.cairo`, I have copied/pasted the content from Starkware's ERC20 implementation example (https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/main/crates/cairo-lang-starknet/test_data/erc20.cairo).
4) I added a `tests` module, including a `test_constructor` function, exactly like Robert did (see here for his function: https://www.youtube.com/live/6f1u1vMNNh0?feature=share&t=3207).
5) I added: `mod ERC20;` in `lib.cairo`.
6) I created and implemented the `cairo_project_toml file`, just like Robert does in the replay from live coding session.

Now, when I run: `cairo-test --starknet .` (which is the exact same command that Robert runs in his terminal) I get the following error message:
```

I do assume the error obviously comes from me but I tried several times and always end up with the same error...
