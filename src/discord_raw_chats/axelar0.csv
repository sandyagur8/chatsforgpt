We've been updating the SDK and the backend so I think the previous inputs aren't valid anymore, make sure to try with the latest version. While currently we intend for developers to use the JS SDK to simplify the integration, @Canh T can help look into your issue to get it to work directly.","","üëç (28),üî• (2)"

The whitepaper talks about Threshold signatures specifically which can be used for optimizing gas costs for signature verification on external chains. But for most of the EVM chains we currently support, a multisig scheme is not that expensive, so we use that. The network design allows us to customize which signature scheme and corresponding safety/liveness thresholds to use per chain. For e.g. in the case of Bitcoin, we used a threshold scheme with really high safety thresholds (over 5/6 validators by stake would be needed for registering keys). Although we don't have a lot of docs on this yet, exact params can be found here: https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/blob/main/x/tss/types/params.go#L38=
As we add more validators on the network and implement further optimizations, we can tune these thresholds via governance.","",""

1. The sdk will talk to our backend service to submit a `generate-deposit-address` transaction to the Axelar network, the output is the unique address for the given parameters:  
- source chain  
- destination chain  
- destination address  
- asset to transfer (we use common_key that defined here https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarjs-sdk/blob/0.5.0-alpha.14/src/assets/testnet.assets.ts ‚Üê this is for testnet, just for example)  
  
2. Submit your token to that generated deposit address  
- if your source chain is cosmos-based chain, you have to ibc-transfer to axelar's generated deposit address.  
- if your source chain is evm-based chain, you have to call `transfer` function of `erc20` contract to axelar's generated deposit address.  
  
3. Once your deposit transaction has enough confirmation, the axelar network will automatically validate your deposit transaction. If it is valid, then our network will relay your transaction differently depends on the destination chain:  
- if the destination chain is cosmos-based chain, then our network will be using ibc-transfer to transfer token to the given destination address in step 1.  
- if the destination chain is evm-based chain, then our network will submit `execute` transaction to the `AxelarGatewayContract` at the destination chain to send the token to given destination address.

I am trying to learn about Axelar to be able to programmatically get deposit addresses in order to transfer tokens around cosmos (at first). First I installed the CLI, configurated an public RPC, and tried to use 'axelard tx axelarnet link', getting 'Error: rpc error: code = NotFound desc = rpc error: code = NotFound desc = account axelar1c... not found: key not found'. After reading through Discord and Docs, I got into the conclusion that in order to be able to use the CLI to use 'link' to get deposit addresses I need to be a Validator. Is that true or I am getting it wrong?
Then I read about the AxelarJS sdk, but Im starting to think that I will face the same problem as with the CLI...
Also, I have a question about deposit addresses generated (through Satellite). Are they really temporal? As I understand, they are temporal addresses getting monitored by Axelar Relayers, but after getting a deposit they stop being monitored? Monitoring keeps going on if they never get a deposit? Can they be reused? I tried to look for answers in the docs, but couldnt get it clear.
Thanks a lot for reading my questions, will be thankful for any tips or direction. gn!","",""
"728329536084901935","sergeynog","07/06/2022 6:39 pm","hey @Windsurfer : great questions. 

* you don't need to be a validator to get a deposit address. you can do it from any node. did you send funds to your key ? can you check it's balance? 
* axelar sdk should similarly work. it doesn't need a node to be installed locally. 
* typically the keys are not ephemeral, but our relayers only monitor deposits to them for 24h at the moment. we might extend it. during certain upgrades, deposit addresses expire [as with an upgrade that's scheduled for tomorrow as we notified]. 
* we're adding another way to generate deposits deterministically, where the addresses shouldn't expire and you'll be able to locally generate them for EVM chains only. 
* also, you can call the EVM gateways directly [via the gas receiver if you want us to relay].

It takes less than 10 minutes to integrate a new EVM chain with all other interconnected chains on the Axelar network so setting it up is simple but the team also wants to ensure that each new chain is fully supported and has enough liquidity.

Essentially you need to support 2 operations either in the erc-20* variant itself [we'll put one live soon] or deploy as wrapper contracts. We can also write some examples if you think it'd be helpful. 

To help auth your contracts across chains, take a look at the constant address deployer: https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/solidity-utilities. You can build the a wrapper contract and deploy its instance across multiple chains with the same address. Then, when you receive a message, you validate that it came from the same address as the contract itself [as you add more chains, no extra work is required]. You can use the Axelar gateway to authenticate the [source chain, source address] tuple of each packet. Does that make sense?","","Axelarthumbs (1)"

        });

When I run it, it gives me a lot of relevant data that seems correct, but its status is shown as `status: 'destination_gateway_approved'`. In Axelarscan, it says that it was executed. And when I check on the chain, it certainly has been! I would expect the status to be `destination_executed` instead. Is this a bug, or am I interpreting it incorrectly?","",""

Then after being confirmed by the Axelar validators and signed by their keys the command is delivered to the gateway on the destination chain and gets approved by the gateway to be executed. This also emits an event from the gateway: `ContractCallApproved` or `ContractCallApprovedWithMint`
```
    event ContractCallApproved(
        bytes32 indexed commandId,
        string sourceChain,
        string sourceAddress,
        address indexed contractAddress,
        bytes32 indexed payloadHash,
        bytes32 sourceTxHash,

```
After this our cross-chain gas service will pick the event and will call the `contractAddress.execute(...)` with corresponding parameters. That `contractAddress` should implement `AxelarExecutable`  for seamless command validation with the gateway.

Friend said if the Axelar blockchain gets compromised, the assets are stolen. If you own 66% of AXL , you can steal assets. 

I said that Axelar is a network with gateways set up on various chains, that communicate through the axelar protocol -- rather than a chain in itself. 
And axelar is the protocol and Satellite is the asset bridge built on top of the GMP. I guess to attack the underlying protocol, it's not just AXL ownership but the number of validators that need to agree on a given state through signing with key shares.

Friend said TSS is there to sign on ethereum chain for an axelar state, and Axelar state is still PoS. So if you run 66% of axelar stake you can sign transactions on eth.

But is there really an ""axelar state?""","",""

While PoS requires `66%+` by stake, our contracts actually use the square root of the validator's stake divided by the sum of sqrts of validator's stake (known as quadratic voting).

I am currently trying to develop a protocol to solve the interoperability problem between blockchains.

To give you a quick overview, I am thinking of developing a communication protocol that allows a smart contract of ChainA to retrieve data from a smart contract of ChainB.
We would also like to develop a mechanism that does not generate a transaction when acquiring the data in order to reduce the cost of acquiring the data.
However, we believe that there are significant technical challenges to achieving this, so we would like to contact you to discuss the idea and the technical details.

The details of the idea can be found at the following link

will give you the deposit address for a transfer of tokens from any cosmos-based chain. you use this to generate the axelar address (not the `DirectSecp256k1HdWallet`. 

once you call `sdk.getDepositAddress`, the axelar deposit address is generated by the axelar network, and the combination of our network and services we have on top will listen for deposits you make into that deposit address and automatically relay the tokens to your specified destionation chain once that happens. 

in regards, to the IBC transfer, you can use cosmjs that exposes a `sendIbcTokens` method you can call programmatically to make the deposit via IBC transfer. here is a unit test in their library you can follow as example: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/stargate/src/signingstargateclient.spec.ts#L211
the only missing pieces of information you will need to collect are:
1. the channel ID from your specified source chain to axelar. [i see above you referenced `channel-208`, i assume you are sending from Osmosis?
2. the denom of the asset you are going to transfer, as it as recognized on the source chain. the (kind of) complicated part is the fact that the denoms of the assets are path-dependent. for example, the denom for usdc (atomic denom `uusdc`) on Osmosis is `ibc/D189335C6E4A68B513C10AB227BF1C1D38C746766278BA3EEB4FB14124F1D858` (derived from the sha256 hash of `transfer/channel-208/uusdc` , which you can try here https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html)","",""

Depending on the EVM chain, we check if the tx is in a finalized block. For PoW Ethereum, we wait for 35 block confirmations. After the Merge, we'll use the finalized tag. We are certainly working on adding non EVM, non Cosmos chains, but those do take longer since we need to implement a protocol interface to it.

Here's the TL;DR version: 

**Security is complex, and achieving robust security comes down to the right designs, engineering, processes & operations.**

Axelar continues to lead the innovation front for cross-chain security with its latest release adding new features.

Axelar security is powered by a combination of:

:Cross1: Proof-of-stake decentralized design at the core.

:Cross1:Novel quadratic voting mechanism increases decentralization of the network.

:Cross1:Validator security policies, such as mandatory key rotations.

:Cross1:Network functions that enable mitigation of malicious interconnected chains [suspend traffic from them].

:Cross1:Contract limits that specify how much can be transferred over a time period.

:Cross1:Rigorous audits & bug bounties.

@collators @collators-moonbeam :alert: We recently had a bad block on Moonbeam due to equivocation. This caused a finalization issue between the EVM and Substrate hashes. Equivocation is strictly forbidden due to the network degradation it implies. We will communicate soon with a more detailed explanation.

To fix the current bad block, all RPC nodes on the network now have to resync to get past this block. (Collators don't have to resync)

Equivocation is the action of submitting multiple blocks at the same block height. This happens when you are running multiple nodes with the same Nmbs key. This can be done by a malicious actor (trying to get more blocks included/produced) or by mistake (having a backup node running with the same key).

If another equivocation is detected, we will need to implement a solution to prevent it (Using governance or on-chain slashing for the collators).

Each node needs to have its own unique keys and any backup solutions need to ensure there can be no possibility of equivocation.  Everyone needs to double check their configurations and backup solutions today to ensure this won‚Äôt happen again.

If anyone has questions on backup solutions let‚Äôs discuss here.  Some of the community members have already posted their backup solutions which will avoid equivocation.","",""

E.g. it's instant on Avalanche, but is over 120-130 blocks on Polygon. Thus, we need to wait for that long before validators can vote for an EVM transaction on the source chain. Second is gas price fluctuations on the destination chain. When we relay transactions to the destination chain, sometimes they need to be repriced and resubmitted on the destination chain, and sometimes multiple times until pricing logic catches up with the actual prices.

Normally a correct tx should come through within a few minutes. Occasionally when tx is being repriced that might take longer.

Correct, in `IAxelarExecutable` we are checking for approval on the gateway, which in turn means that Axelar validators voted on TX on the source chain and signed the call to the gateway.

Our relayer service checks whether the contract call and the gas payment are in the same transaction or not before confirming it on the network.

What are some novel use cases this partership will enable?

üõ†Ô∏è **Seamless cross-chain swaps:** users will be able to execute cross-chain swaps across assets living on distinct chains [ETH -> AVAX]. To do this, ETH can be swapped for USDC which is routed and swapped for AVAX on the destination chain. Routing & execution on the destination chain is abstracted from the user, delivering a seamless 1-click experience. The LPs never assume any bridge risk, as they hold native ETH, USDC and AVAX on both chains. 

üõ†Ô∏è **One-click deposits:** Open a position on a perpetuals exchange like dYdX, which lives on its own application specific chain, from anywhere. On a source chain ‚Äî Avalanche, for ex ‚Äî the user issues a single transaction which sends USDC to the dYdX chain & opens a position on behalf of the user. To close their position, the user later issues another transaction from Avalanche, which on the backend gets routed to the dYdX chain. The user never has to switch wallets, or even know that dYdX is on a different chain. No slippage is incurred.

üõ†Ô∏è **Cross-chain NFTs:** A USDC holder on Solana wants to buy an NFT listed on OpenSea on Ethereum. The user issues a txn from their Phantom wallet, the NFT is purchased on OpenSea on Ethereum, and delivered back to the user‚Äôs Phantom wallet on Solana. The user saved time & effort by not needing to interact with an Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g. MetaMask) and can now use their NFT within Solana applications.

I want to create a multichain dapp and I want to send tokens around, here I can see the list of tokens, addresses etc:

https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/build/contract-addresses/mainnet

axlUSDC looks fine, there are addresses in all supported chains (well except aurora?)

But then WETH is only on ethereum? That means I can't send WETH from polygon to avalanche for example?

then axlDAI is present in 5 chains but there are 7 chains supported in the docs: https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/build/chain-names/mainnet

I also wrote an email to security@axelar.network about whether the Immunefi T&Cs could be changed.

How is the `_executeWithToken() ` function getting called from `gateway.callContractWithToken()`? **

What I found out so far: 
1. the contract has a `sendToMany()` function that calls `gateway.callContractWithToken()` 
2. the contract also overrides `_executeWithToken()` from `AxelarExecutable`
3. But inside `callContractWithToken` which calls inner function `_burnTokenFrom`,  it burns tokens accordingly based on whether the token is external or internal. But it does not actually execute the transfers which is supposed to occur in `_executeWithToken()`.

**My Steps: **
1. `node scripts/createLocal`
2. `node scripts/deploy examples/my-example local`
3. `node scripts/test examples/my-example local ""Moonbeam"" ""Avalanche""`
4. `my-example` is basically `DistributionExecutable.sol` with simplified adjustments to send tokens to a single address instead of an array of addresses. 
4. Examining the Following Event Log: 

The last event in the log has the following:
```
topics: [
'0x7e50569d26be643bda7757722291ec66b1be66d8283474ae3fab5a98f878a7a2',    '0x00000000000000000000000067af079dcfc60e1118ae9fc0433f8e187b4a79c8',
'0x27ad66247bcdb165b8cc175cff68858f3b194aaf6228d1d4433c07a69fd87b41'
]
```
The first element is the correct keccak256 hash of `ContractCallWithToken`, second element is the correct indexed recipient address, and the 3rd element is the correct indexed keccak256 hash of the abi encoded payload. 

My understanding is that Events are emitted chronologically, so when this event was emitted, the relayer should have picked up on this and called the `_executeWithToken()` function on my contract, emitting another `Transfer` event. 

(Actually I just ran the `DistributionExecutable.sol` to see its event log and it also has the `ContractCallWithToken` event as the last, not the `Transfer` event that should happen after in the destination chain. Why is this? Aren't events in the log appended chronologically?) 

**Question:**
So what else might be the reason that the recipient address is not actually getting subtracted after the call? 

The `while (BigInt(await destination.usdc.balanceOf(accounts[0])) === balance)` is never getting called and the test just hangs here forever waiting.

* I want to send a message from ORIGIN to DEST chain, when it is processed in the DEST chain, I want to receive something in the ORIGIN chain
* The examples I saw regarding ACK with Axelar, require that the gas of both messages (initial msg + ACK msg) is paid in the ORIGIN chain (2 calls to gasService one for the normal msg and the other one for the ACK)
* But when you pay gas in the service, you have to specify some params, including the `payload`, which means I have to know the payload of the ACK message beforehand, right? Since I need to pay the gas for it and the payload needs to match so the relayers know that the gas was paid for that specific call

My problem  is that I don't necessarily know what `payload` my ACK message will contain, it will be calculated in the DEST chain and it is not known by the ORIGIN chain until the ACK msg is received","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/955655587260170272/1044288111619870750/unknown.png",""

It's a pattern used to do a 2-way callback. I.e.
1. a  call to a gateway on the source chain,
2. sends a transaction on the destination chain, 
3. that in-turn calls the gateway on the destination chain
4. that triggers the contract on the source chain.

Normally you can use this API https://docs.axelarscan.io/general-message-passing/getFees to get an idea of the fees (or corresponding SDK methods), however currently it won't return the right values when Arbitrum, Celo or Kava are your destination chains. Those three chains were recently added and minimal base fees haven't been set yet. I forwarded this to the team to get configuration sorted. In the meantime, make sure you transfer at least `1500000000000000` in source chain token when any of those three are the destination, or use different destination chains paying at least the amount of `source_base_fee` returned by the API (better for some padding to allow for gas fluctuations).

The third transaction is confirmed now. Our relaying services wait for finality on the source chain before confirming. For that purpose, worst-case finality on Arbitrum takes a long as `finality on Ethereum + L2->L1 sync frequency` which can be in the 30-40m range. Our relayer services are currently using a non-optimal approach to finality that causes some additional overhead. In this case it took ~50m. It's hard to tell how much of that was the overhead - maybe ~10m, maybe less. 

It's in our short/mid term roadmap to optimise finality on Arbitrum, but in the meantime just allow it more time when Arbitrum is the source chain.","",""

After verifying user deposits/cross-chain calls, they create signed approvals/commands (and batch them). These signed batches of commands can be relayed by anyone, since our gateway contract verifies the signatures. Axelar deployer is just a relayer we run for user's convenience and security is not affected at all if it's compromised.
You can find these batches (and relay them yourself!) here: https://axelarscan.io/batches

When the validator set on Axelar changes, the network also signs an update to the validator set for the gateway contract. For e.g:

 Is Axelar working on a solution of this magnitude?  tell me yes...
 So if we will have a true 1:1 liquid staking for the entire ecosystem, we will only have to authorize our wallets to link our native tokens to the derivatives of these in staking, and these will be generated, something similar to how AUTH does with delegations but allowing that in In the event that you sell your derivatives, you can no longer access the native token, as is the case with these protocols and their smart contracts.","",""

I know some builders are using multiple message passing solutions in their architecture. If you are using LayerZero, please read the report by L2Beat to understand the security risks they discovered.

https://twitter.com/l2beat/status/1611008135086411779?s=20&t=UsoqNW1AtCknpEHqarX9ug

""As we could see above, even though our token was built using LayerZero and used its mechanics as intended, we were able to steal funds from the tokens‚Äô escrow. Of course, it was a fault of the application (CarpetMoon token in our case) and not the LayerZero itself, but that proves that LayerZero by itself does not provide any security guarantees.

When LayerZero describes their security model regarding Oracle and Relayer, they assume that app owners (or someone in possession of their private keys) won‚Äôt do anything irrational. But that assumption is incorrect in an adversarial environment. Moreover, it requires the users to trust the application owners as a trusted third party.

In practice, as a result of this, one can not make any assumptions about the security of the applications built using LayerZero ‚Äî each app should be considered risky until proven otherwise.""","",""

""LayerZero claims that ‚ÄúLayerZero‚Äôs design eliminates the possibility of collusion‚Äù. But in fact, that statement is not true (which we prove in the experiment showcased below), as each user application can define its own Relayer and Oracle. LayerZero does not guarantee by design that those components are independent and that they cannot collude. It‚Äôs up to the user application to provide those guarantees. And if the application chooses to break them, there‚Äôs nothing in the LayerZero mechanics that can stop it from doing so.""

Axelar uses a shared security model where it is built using the battle-tested proof-of-stake consensus with a diverse and dynamic validator set. Anyone can join, anyone can participate, anyone can contribute to the security of the network.

In most Byzantine systems, if you break liveness, the system halts its operation, but an adversary would need to do much more to break safety. For instance, a blockchain may halt under a denial-of-service attack on its validators, limiting their ability to send messages and reach consensus. But to break the safety of the blockchain, the adversary might need to find vulnerabilities in validator nodes and extract their secret keys.
Robustness of such systems is thus achieved via diversification of software deployments. One validator might deploy on an Ubuntu machine, another on Debian, some in cloud environments, some on-premise [definitely the preferred route].","","Fire (2)"

I have a question about architecture of Axelar GMP:

For each GMP transaction (general case - without tokens transfering) we have 2 transactions on destination chain: Call Approved and Executed. 

For example here:
https://www.axelarscan.io/gmp/0xae9994b77405f76668d47913b95bb67e3a672fe81186819ac2159e2b7f3dee5e:3

Both transactions are performed by Relayers. 

But it is quite confusing: why we need two transactions on destination chain? It seems, that it is enough 1 transaction to perform execution in destination chain.

At which stage Call Approved happens? At which stage Executed happens? Several seconds between this calls? What does happen on Axelar network between this two calls? Which changes happens at state of Axelar Networks? 

If I understand it correctly,  cross-chain request with gathered signature are stored on Axelar network (permanently). 

Please can you also explain process of consensus on network level and handling of 1 request?

CGP commands are batched together to make paying for authentication efficient, as one signature can verify many commands that were authorized by the Axelar validator set. 

The calldata in the `ContractCall` will call arbitrary code that cannot be known to GMP ahead of time  - it depends on the developer's application. If execution were included in this command batch then it would be possible for arbitrary execution to require an amount of gas that would exceed the limit, causing all the commands in the batch to revert. This would require each GMP request to be signed by the network separately, severely limiting the network throughput.

It is also more secure to have the arbitrary execution occur in a separate transaction to the authentication.

Doing both together would limit the amount of gas available to execution as well because the authentication would use up some of the gas.","",""

Step-by-step explanation:
1) New block  #1000  with 100 GMP request appears on Source chain.

2) Axelar validators parse source chain block, get these request objects (events actually) and compose block with request from source chain.

3) Axelar validators started process of consensus for this particular block and if get 2/3 voting power (if I drew the right parallel to the way Tendermint works, then for a block to be signed by so many participants that their total stake exceeds 2/3 of network)

4) If the block was successfully signed it is saved in Axelar storage and anyone can get access to this block.

5) Relayer (anyone can do that) take this block to  from Axelar network and send it to the destination chain to Gateway smart-contract. 

6) Smart-contract makes sure, that block is presented on Axelar network (Merkle proof? Or which mechanic?)

7) If everything ok, all events from Block #1000 are registered on destination chain. That means that smart-cantract will allow to send ""execution transaction"" for cross-chain request with certain registered number.

2) 
The network is made up of a safety layer (validators) and a liveness layer (relayers). The relayer layer notifies the validators of GMP requests hitting the gateway. It is not the responsibility of the validators to parse every single block. When they are told about a specific transaction they will vote for the GMP requests it contains. We are working on several optimizations to this process to improve performance, but it's simplicity allowed us to launch the mainnet with high confidence in the security.

This separates network monitoring, which has its own set of reliability concerns, from voting on confirmation of finality. Anyone can submit transactions to the Axelar blockchain to confirm it, but we operate a relayer service which will do the monitoring and confirmation on your behalf when you pay fees to the `AxelarGasService` contract, but it is possible for anyone to operate an alternate service layer.

4) the block is not saved to storage. For each transaction in a block the validators vote on the list of transactions they contain. The GMP request parameters are saved to the Axelar chain if the validators agree on them.

5) the validators will periodically sign a batch of GMP requests to be delivered to a destination chain, which anyone can relay

6) if the batch signature matches the signatures of the active validator set then all the command IDs in the batch are approved for execution

7) request payloads (calldata) are not stored on axelar, only the sender, destination address, destination chain, and payload hash.","",""

There is a change to how gas fees for GMP is calculated.

* Gas fee estimation for GMP transactions (`callContract` and `callContractWithToken` will start to be calculated dynamically based on the current market price for the native token being used to pay the fee on the source chain and the current gas price on the destination chain

Axelar abstracts the wrapping and unwrapping necessary to transfer EVM tokens across chains. For the user, there are no extra steps. Axelar SDK handles it on the back end. 

What does this mean for builders?  You can integrate native EVM cross-chain asset transfers into dApps using the AxelarJS SDK (version 0.12.1+) by following he steps at this link: 

üëâ https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/token-transfer-dep-addr

Here's the TL;DR: 

üìç Squid acts as a router that connects existing DEX liquidity across chains through Axelar‚Äôs secure cross-chain platform. 

üìçUsers can get any token on any of Axelar‚Äôs supported chains in a single click. Each swap is powered by Axelar, inheriting their speed, security and wide chain coverage.

üìçSquid‚Äôs goal is to put this powerful, user-centric approach into the hands of developers who are building the next generation of crypto-native apps. 

üìçThey enable this through their API, SDK and front-end widget, a prebuilt UI that takes minutes to integrate.

And here's how you can start leveraging their platform:

1. User connects to dapp on chain A, giving as user input the destination chain, as well as a tx hash on that chain or maybe an event plus contract address to extract a certain value
2. This request gets encoded into a payload within a contract on chain A, and sent to the gateway on contract on chain A
3. Axelar nodes would query the light clients of chain B, reach consensus on the value requested, and relay answer back to contract on chain A

-->>hey all - is it still the case that 80% of validator vote power needs to approve and co-sign any cross chain tx?
According to the WhitePaper nothing was changed regarding this: 
```
Subsequently, the Axelar base layer is aware of the state of external blockchains at any point in time, creating the ‚Äúincoming bridges‚Äù from other blockchains. The validators collectively maintain threshold signature accounts on other blockchains (e.g., 80% of validators must approve and co-sign any transaction out of it), which allows them to lock and unlock assets and state across chains and to post state on other blockchains, the ‚Äúoutgoing bridges.‚Äù Altogether, one can view the Axelar network as a decentralized crosschain read/write oracle.
```
and 90% of validator vote power needs to collude to withdraw funds or forge a state proof?
```
Maximum Safety. Axelar sets the safety threshold to 90%, meaning that almost all validators will need to collude to withdraw any funds that are locked by its network or forge state proofs1. In practice, it has been observed that PoS validators have very high up-time (close to 100%), assuming they are properly incentivized. Hence, Axelar network will produce blocks even despite this high threshold. However, in the rare case that something goes wrong and the network stalls, the network needs robust fall-back mechanisms to reboot the system described next.
```

Hey, sorry for the wait. There are several ways how assets can be transferred using Axelar stack:
1. via `AxelarDepositService` contract using `addressForTokenDeposit` or `addressForNativeDeposit` 
2. via `sendToken` on `AxelarGateway` contract
3. via so-called burner deposit addresses generated by sending a `Link` request like these https://axelarscan.io/transactions/search?type=LinkRequest - this is what `sdk.getDepositAddress` does under the hood. Neither `AxelarDepositService`  nor `sendToken` are being used in this case.

`sendToken` is the simplest one - an application/user explicitly sends assets and where they want them delivered, then upon finality on the source chain and successful confirmation by validators, required amount of token is minted on the destination chain (or transferred in the IBC case). At this stage this call can only be initiated on an EVM chain using an ERC20 token, but it can target either an EVM chain or a Cosmos chain. 

`addressForTokenDeposit` is essentially just another way to call `sendToken`, but without actively interacting with a smart contract. The address can be calculated offline, but  our relaying services need to be aware of it so that they can monitor transfers to that address. We provide an API for that and it will be exposed in the js sdk soon (AFAIK it's not yet). Upon detection of a transfer on the address, relaying services call `AxelarDepositService` which initiates a `sendToken` call cross chain. Such passive approach is helpful when interacting with third party dApps  (like exchanges, etc.) that e.g. require an address for transfer/withdrawal. We can only deposit ERC20 tokens on an EVM chain to this address, but similarly assets can go either to a Cosmos or an EVM chain.","",""
"930020056220454943","ilyalukyanov","17/02/2023 9:00 am","`addressForNativeDeposit` is exactly the same as  `addressForTokenDeposit` except it allows to deposit native token. Before transferring funds cross-chain the native token will be automatically wrapped on the source chain into its ERC20 version (e.g. ETH -> WETH) which will then be transferred cross chain like with  `addressForTokenDeposit`. It's exposed on the SDK here - https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelarjs-sdk/blob/302cb4673e0293b707d3401ad141be5e9cec2bbf/src/libs/AxelarAssetTransfer.ts#L74

Burner addresses achieve pretty much the same  as in the case of `addressForTokenDeposit` with several key differences:
1. Burner addresses are persistent on Axelar (and this address cannot be created offline)
2. Transfers between any chain ""worlds"" are supported: EVM <-> EVM, Cosmos <-> EVM or Cosmos <-> Cosmos 
3. This address can only be jointly controlled by Axelar validators and only for the token and source/destination it was created for. If a wrong transfer is made to such address, funds may be lost. The logic of the process is within `axelard` itself rather than a smart contract.

This is what they do and how they are different at a high level","",""

"767368050235670588","axelarnetwork","21/02/2023 11:29 pm","for the first question, the only purely monetary incentive would be the potential to get into active set. We also see developers who want to build on top of our network and play around with the setups. 

Validators aren‚Äôt connected to the relayers, this is a different and completely permissionless activity on the network, so if one relayer goes down, anyone can step in and spin up a new connection to support the relaying services. Anyone can provide relaying services by calling APIs we‚Äôve exposed,  and you only really need 1 relayer for liveness.

Axelar validators connect to other chains through an RPC endpoint in order to vote or do read events for those chains, and they need to have some balance on a broadcaster account to be able to pay gas. The current active set can be seen here: https://axelarscan.io/validators

Anyone can run a relayer, and gas is only involved when making transactions like send token- so running a fullnode won‚Äôt require transaction to pay gas.

Speaking as a non-dev here, I assume one key challenge lies in making sure everything is cryptographically secure and bug testing may take a considerable amount of time as well.

To initiate a gmp call, you would need to pay for 
1) the network base fee 
2) gas for execution 

I'd suggest to use the `estimateGasFee`  method to get the estimation (https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#estimategasfee). You can pass the gas limit, src/dest chains of the gmp call, and the token to pay for gas to the method. It will calculate both fees and give you an estimation to be paid in the token you want to pay on the source chain.","",""

I'm a newbie in smart contract dev and I am trying to understand axelar's capabilities, so please forgive my possibly stupid questions üòâ 

I have some, questions about the asset transfer flow moving tokens from chain A to chain B.

If I got it right from the axelar docs, the flow is like this, if a User wants to move e.g. USDC from Chain A to Chain B:

**1.** User generates a linked deposit address transfer and sends the number of USDC they want to transfer cross-chain to the deposit address 
          **=> How does this 'linked deposit address' work in detail?**

**2.** Axelar validators confirm the deposit transaction made by the user

**3.** Axelar Gateway on Chain B mint the USDC on Chain B and transfers it to user's chain B deposit address
         **=> Here I have a problem of understanding. How are the token transfered to Chain B? Has Axelar access to the generated address from step 1 and swaps / bridges the token to Chain B or with which funds is the minting paid on Chain B by the Gateway contract? **

**4.** Axelar validators confirm the minting and the transfer to user's chain B deposit address

**5.** Axelar Gateway on Chain A burns the token if everything was successful or returns the token in case of an error

Is this flow roughly correct and do step 4 and 5 exists (did not saw them in the docs)?

I am grateful for any explanation and hint üòÄ","",""

thank you very much for your explanation  üòÄ üëç 

But unfortunately I still don`t get it how axelar acts in detail here (sorry). 

My understanding is that axelar must have have access / grant rights to the deposit address / contract on the source chain in order to act on the funds / token. 
For example I want to send USDC from Ethereum to Osmosis using satellite, I need to first deposit the USDC to an Contract from Circle (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 - on Ethereum ). How can Axelar use these funds, did I grant the Axelar Gateway Contract on the source chain the right to transfer my USDC (which I missed to recognized the first time) or how does it work in detail (more fine granular)? 

And if I transfer e.g. native ETH via satellite to Osmosis, I have to send it to a temporary deposit address generated by Axelar. How does this work in detail?

Maybe there are some docs / links on the detailed workflow?

Many thanks in advance for your efforts. üòÄ","",""

1. `forest_` is the deployed address of the AxelarExecutable you deployed on Ethereum? (wouldn't explain the above issue, just clarifying). 
2. can you try changing the first parameter of `payNativeGasForContractCall` to `address(this)` instead? (I think our services match up the the address of the contract invoking the method to the key used to determine who paid the gas). 
3. i believe you actually need to specify a value for `payNativeGasForContractCall`. So i'd make sure your method is payable and change its invocation to `gasService.payNativeGasForContractCall{ value: msg.value }`

If you know the amount of gas on the dest chain required to execute your contract, you can actually input that in the `estimate-gas-fee` API from before: 

{
    ""srcChainId"": ""aurora"",
    ""destChainId"": ""ethereum-2"",
    ""srcChainTokenSymbol"": ""aETH"",
    ""gasLimit"": 150000, //this is optional

on your axelarscan link above, i manually executed and see that your tx used 118K gas. https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x0eda14506d5d6e7613e72a8ef21f3bd69d69b54c19cb0692a91d68376006c7d7. you can play around with the `gasLimit` and `gasMultiplier` params here to get the right amount of gas you pay on the source chain. it might be a good idea to bump these higher to increase ""execution certainty"", e.g. some of our partners use a gasMultiple of upwards of 1.5-2x given volatility of gas prices on some chains (though you'll be refunded later for whatever isn't used).","",""

As you know, there is a plan to announce an addition of a Virtual Machine on the Axelar network. We‚Äôre looking a few strong developer partners to help build out some new integrations. DM me if you‚Äôre interested! You should have experience in Go and/or Rust, distribution systems, know basics of cryptography, and be interested in consensus protocols. (https://axelar.network/blog/axelar-virtual-machine-future-of-interoperability) 
¬†
Axelar Interchain Amplifier: Developer Partner Program
¬†
Interchain Amplifier is a set of services (instantiated via a hybrid of consensus features & Cosmwasm contracts) on the Axelar network that can be leveraged to amplify interchain connectivity. The key properties include universal many-to-many routing, message translation across different chain stacks, and robust proof of stake-powered security. Any chain connected to the stack will be immediately composable with other interconnected chains. 
¬†
Objective:¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®
* Accelerate the buildout of interchain by establishing new connections to the Axelar network.
* Collaborate with external partners on technical integrations, go-to-market, and marketing efforts.¬†
¬†
Parties:¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®
* Axelar
* Chain partner¬†
* Developer partner
¬†
Benefits for a developer partner:¬†‚Ä®‚Ä®
* Build one connection to the Axelar network, leverage dozens of its integrations & full stack of interoperability to connect a new ecosystem to get maximum utility of your work.¬†
* Get financial alignment with the Axelar network.¬†
* Collaborate on building the interchain with many like minded groups and ecosystems.¬†
* All protocol level code is open-sourced and can be used and modified by communities.¬†
¬†
Axelar and a chain partner will provide grants to cover engineering and audit costs of the integrations. Additional bonus AXL incentives will be provided at launch and upon hitting certain volumes through your connection.","","üéâ (8)"

1. Is that right?
2. If axelar1aaaa tries to claim, what will happen? Will it fail or will rewards be pushed to axelar1bbbb?","",""

The AVM is meant to supercharge Axelar's interoperability model. Currently, the Axelar blockchain implements the logic for authentication of cross chain messages. For cosmos chains, we make use of IBC, and for EVM chains, we rely on RPC based voting from Axelar validators. With the upcoming AVM, anyone will be able to add this logic to Axelar and customize it to their needs. For e.g., a connection to Near using the RPC based voting by validators is in the works:
https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-cgp-near
Furthermore, instead of using RPC based voting method for verification, we can use a zero knowledge based authentication for zkEVMs. You can also have 2 or 3 different authentication mechanisms that also need to be applied for the same chain for even more security. Either the Axelar team, or third parties will be implementing these connections and Axelar foundation has various grants for interested contributors. Of course, before integrations use a specific connection as the default for that chain, the implementation will undergo various audits, testing etc.

We'll have more docs on this soon. But I'm happy to answer more specific questions that you might have.","",""

Yes, there are a few ways to estimate and calculate the gas fee for executing a smart contract on a blockchain.

Most smart contract platforms provide a method to estimate the gas fee required for a transaction. For example, in Ethereum, you can use the `web3.eth.estimateGas` method to estimate the gas required for a transaction. 


Or using the gas limit multiply by gas price since every Ethereum transaction have this.

Additionally thhere are many gas fee calculators available online that can help you estimate the gas fee for a transaction. These calculators take into account the current gas price and the gas limit to give you an estimated cost.


However, Axelar provides `estimateGasFee`. This is a useful query for GMP transactions, when invoking `callContract` or `callContractWithToken` to get an estimate of the appropriate gas payment to be made to the gas receiver on the source chain.

Check here: https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#estimategasfee

> In Prime‚Äôs hub-and-spoke architecture, assets stay on their native chains. State is synchronized and actions authorized via secure messages passed between chains.
> 
> Prime uses Axelar's General Message Passing to transfer any payload securely between chains including data and function calls, allowing applications to build beyond bridges.

Attached is the diagram and the case study to learn more!

Regarding the pricing for each chain, there is no fixed price. Instead, you can obtain estimates for the fees using our SDK's useful query for GMP transactions. When invoking the `callContrac`t or `callContractWithToken` functions, you can retrieve an estimate of the gas payment required for the transaction to be executed on the source chain.

As you mentioned, all the components mentioned in the documentation work together to calculate the total amount, taking into account the network state. Any excess amount paid is refunded at the end of the transaction to ensure a successful end-to-end process.

This approach allows for flexibility in pricing and ensures that the transaction is appropriately funded while considering the dynamic nature of gas fees and network conditions.

I am not 100% sure of what you mean by `which is my ""official token""` but if you are making your token an interchain token Axelar will configure an interchain token linker for you and then you can choose to register the token on any chain of your choice with your address as the owner.

You can initiate a new Hardhat project and subsequently include the callContractwithToken contract. You can find a reference here: https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/gmp-tokens-with-messages or in the Axelar Examples Repository.

Following that, set up an RPC connection to a testnet and create a deployment script to test the project, similar to the testing process for any Hardhat project.","",""

Here are a few possibilities of what you can achieve with Interchain Tokens without the need for explicit GMP calls. Please note that the capabilities of Interchain Tokens extend beyond what I am about to mention, as they may vary depending on the use case.

Cross-Chain Transfer: Tokens can be transferred between different chains without explicit GMP calls or custom message passing implementations.

Chain-Agnostic Wallets: Wallets can aggregate token balances from multiple chains, providing a unified user experience.

Asset Bridges: Interchain Tokens enable the creation of bridges for token transfers between different chains.

Interchain dApps: Interchain Tokens can be integrated into decentralized applications for cross-chain functionality and asset transfers.

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","07/06/2023 12:36 pm","To deploy the same contract at the same address on different networks using `deployContractConstant`, you need to use the `Constant Address Deployer` with the address. This deployer ensures that the contract is deployed at the same address on each network.

Here's how to use `deployContractConstant`:

```javascript
const { deployContractConstant } = require('@axelar-network/axelar-utils-solidity');

// ... Set up your deployer, wallet, contractJson, and other required variables

// Deploy the contract with the same address on different networks
await deployContractConstant(deployer, wallet, contractJson, key, args);
```

Make sure you have the correct `deployer`, `wallet`, `contractJson`, `key`, and `args` set up for each network you want to deploy the contract on. The `key` should be the same for all networks to ensure the same address is used.

If you still encounter issues, please double-check your setup and ensure you're using the correct `Constant Address Deployer` address and the same `key` for all networks. If the problem persists, you might want to consult the **Axelar documentation** (https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/solidity-utilities) for more information.","","üëçüèª (1)"

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","07/06/2023 1:13 pm","Yes, you're correct. Once you have generated the deposit address using the AxelarJS SDK, you can send the tokens to the generated deposit address. The transfer will be picked up by the Axelar network and relayed to the destination chain. Here's the example code from the documentation to generate a deposit address:

```javascript
const sdk = new AxelarAssetTransfer({ environment: ""testnet"" });

const fromChain = CHAINS.TESTNET.OSMOSIS,
  toChain = CHAINS.TESTNET.TERRA2,
  destinationAddress = ""terra1x3z2vepjd7fhe30epncxjrk0lehq7xdqe8ltsn"",
  asset = ""uausdc"";

const depositAddress = await sdk.getDepositAddress({
  fromChain,
  toChain,
  destinationAddress,
  asset,
});
```

After obtaining the deposit address, you can send the axlUSDC tokens from Osmosis to the generated deposit address. The Axelar network will monitor the deposit address and relay the tokens to the destination chain (Terra2 in this case) **source** (https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/token-transfer-dep-addr#notes).

Keep in mind that the destination address format is validated based on the destination chain, so make sure the destination address is a valid address on the destination chain **source** (https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/token-transfer-dep-addr#notes).","","üëç (1),üëçüèª (1)"

1. Insufficient gas to execute the transaction: If the prepaid gas is insufficient, you might see error messages like `NOT ENOUGH GAS`, `Insufficient gas for executing the transaction`, or `intrinsic gas too low`. To recover the transfer, you can either manually execute the payload at the destination chain or add more gas to the gas receiver on the source chain. More details can be found in the **error-debugging guide** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/debug/error-debugging>).

2. Error in the destination contract logic: If the error is caused by the destination contract logic, you would see an error message like `Transaction execution was reverted. Please check the implementation of the destination contract's _execute function.` In this case, you should debug your contract and make a new call. You can follow the **Debugging your smart contract** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/debug/debugging-your-smart-contract>) guide.

To further investigate the issue, you can monitor the state of your General Message Passing (GMP) transactions using **Axelarscan UI** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/monitoring>). If the transaction failed to get executed on the destination chain, Axelarscan will provide the option for you to either manually execute a transfer on the destination chain or increase gas payment to the gas receiver on the source chain.

2) gas for execution 

I'd suggest to use the `estimateGasFee`  method to get the estimation (https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api#estimategasfee). You can pass the gas limit, src/dest chains of the gmp call, and the token to pay for gas to the method.

Here are the basic steps outlined by Axelar's co-founder Sergey: https://twitter.com/axelarcore/status/1499053636969709568. Making sure the chain has enough liquidity may be the difficult part. Feel free to reach out to Milap for help with this process.

Here's some basic information about connecting EVM-compatible blockchains to Axelar (from the perspective of a validator).

To connect an EVM-compatible blockchain, Axelar validators must run a node for the new EVM chain and obtain a secured and private RPC endpoint for the EVM chain. This is usually done by the validator running their own node for the EVM chain and using their own RPC endpoint. After this is set up, the validator needs to inform Axelar about their support for this new chain and submit a command to Axelar, registering their validator as a chain maintainer for the new EVM chain (**source** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/validators>)).

As for requiring a validator node from both networks, it is not required for all Axelar validators to support the new EVM chain. As long as a set threshold of validators register as a chain maintainer, the ability to enable the chain at the network level is supported (**source** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/validators>)).","","üëçüèª (1),üëç (1)"

The relayer fee is a separate cost charged by the Axelar network for all cross-chain token transfers to pay for network-level transaction (""gas"") fees across chains. This fee is fixed and depends on the asset, the source chain, and the destination chain. It is not a percentage of the transfer amount.

For example, if you are transferring USDC tokens from Avalanche to Osmosis, the relayer fee might be 1.5 USDC, and this would be deducted from the amount of assets being transferred cross-chain. The recipient would then receive the transferred amount minus the relayer fee.

You can query the current gas relayer fee via node query:

```bash
axelard q nexus transfer-fee [source chain] [destination chain] [amount]
```

And the per-chain gas relayer fee info can be queried via:

```bash
axelard q nexus fee-info [source chain] [token]
```

Remember, the total amount of a token sent to a deposit address must be greater than the gas relayer fee. If it's not, the deposits will wait in the queue until a future deposit brings the total above the fee.

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","07/07/2023 1:23 pm","The `estimateGasFee` method in the AxelarJS SDK is used to calculate the total cost of a transaction, including both the network base fee and the execution fee. The network base fee is fixed and covers three components of the transaction: validator confirmation voting on the Axelar Network, relaying of approval on the destination chain, and costs related to delivering any possible refund on the destination chain. The execution fee, on the other hand, is variable and depends on the complexity of your `_execute` method on the destination chain **source** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/pricing>).

When you're estimating the gas for the `send` function, you're likely only considering the execution fee on the source chain (Ethereum in this case). However, when you're using `callContract`, you're also accounting for the network base fee and the execution fee on the destination chain (Arbitrum in this case). This could explain why the gas estimate for `callContract` is smaller than the gas estimate for the `send` function.

It's also worth noting that the `estimateGasFee` method allows you to specify an estimated gas limit. If you don't specify a gas limit, a default gas limit of 700,000 gas is used **source** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/pricing>). This could also be affecting your gas estimates.

The relayer fee does not take a percentage from the transfer amount. You can query the current gas relayer fee via node query using the following command:

```bash
axelard q nexus transfer-fee [source chain] [destination chain] [amount]
```

For example, to transfer USDC from Avalanche to Osmosis, you would use:

```bash
axelard q nexus transfer-fee avalanche osmosis 1000000000uusdc
```

You can also query the per-chain gas relayer fee info using:

```bash
axelard q nexus fee-info avalanche uusdc
```

If you're using the AxelarJS SDK, you can use the `getTransferFee` function to retrieve the fee charged by the relayer for a transfer:

```javascript
const fee = await axelarQuery.getTransferFee(
 CHAINS.TESTNET.OSMOSIS,
 CHAINS.TESTNET.AVALANCHE,
 ""uausdc"",
 1000000
);
```

Please note that the total amount of a token sent to a deposit address must be greater than the gas relayer fee. If it's not, those deposits will wait in the queue until a future deposit brings the total above the fee.

The discrepancy you're seeing between the documentation and your local version could be due to changes in the network since the documentation was last updated. It's always best to query the current fees directly from the network.","",""

To implement General Message Passing (GMP) for a Cosmos chain, you need to implement the appropriate middleware in Go as part of the consensus layer. This will allow your Cosmos blockchain to support receiving GMP messages, either naively or via CosmWasm. Unfortunately, the extracts do not provide a specific example of how to implement this middleware.

Axelar has provided a **Cosmos GMP Example Project** (<https://github.com/axelarnetwork/evm-cosmos-gmp-sample/>) that you can refer to. This project includes examples of sending and receiving messages in all cases, which might be helpful for your implementation.

For sending a message from CosmWasm Rust code, you need to send a message to the Axelar Gateway via IBC. The payload should be encoded using **ethabi** (<https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethabi>). Here's a code snippet that shows how to send a message to multiple recipients:

```rust
pub fn multi_send_to_evm(
 deps: DepsMut,
 env: Env,
 info: MessageInfo,
 destination_chain: String,
 destination_contract: String,
 recipients: Vec<String>,
 fee: Option<Fee>
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
 let config = CONFIG.load(deps.storage)?;
 
 let addresses = recipients
 .into_iter()
 .map(|s| {
 match s.parse::<H160>() {
 Ok(address) => Ok(Token::Address(Address::from(address))),
 Err(_) => Err(ContractError::InvalidRecipientAddress { address: s }),
 }
 })
 .collect::<Result<Vec<Token>, ContractError>>()?;
 let payload = encode(&[Token::Array(addresses)]);
 
 let msg = GeneralMessage {
 destination_chain,
 destination_address: destination_contract.clone(),
 payload,
 type_: 2,
 fee
 };
 
 let coin = cw_utils::one_coin(&info).unwrap();
 let ibc_transfer = MsgTransfer {
 source_port: ""transfer"".to_string(),
 source_channel: config.channel.to_string(),
 token: Some(coin.into()),
 sender: env.contract.address.to_string(),
 receiver: AXELAR_GATEWAY.to_string(),
 timeout_height: None,
 timeout_timestamp: Some(env.block.time.plus_seconds(604_800u64).nanos()),
 memo: to_string(&msg).unwrap(),
 };
 
 // Base response
 let response = Response::new()
 .add_attribute(""status"", ""ibc_message_created"")
 .add_attribute(""ibc_message"", format!(""{:?}"", ibc_transfer));
 
 return Ok(response.add_message(ibc_transfer));
}
```

This function sends a message to multiple recipients on an EVM chain from a CosmWasm contract. It creates a `GeneralMessage` with the destination chain, destination contract, payload, type, and fee, and then sends this message via IBC.

Here are the details on how estimate gas works:

The `estimateGasFee` method in the AxelarJS SDK is used to calculate the total cost of a transaction, including both the network base fee and the execution fee. The network base fee is fixed and covers three components of the transaction: validator confirmation voting on the Axelar Network, relaying of approval on the destination chain, and costs related to delivering any possible refund on the destination chain. The execution fee, on the other hand, is variable and depends on the complexity of your `_execute` method on the destination chain (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/pricing>).

When you're estimating the gas for the `send` function, you're likely only considering the execution fee on the source chain (Ethereum in this case). However, when you're using `callContract`, you're also accounting for the network base fee and the execution fee on the destination chain (Arbitrum in this case). This could explain why the gas estimate for `callContract` is smaller than the gas estimate for the `send` function.

It's also worth noting that the `estimateGasFee` method allows you to specify an estimated gas limit. If you don't specify a gas limit, a default gas limit of 700,000 gas is used (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/pricing>). This could also be affecting your gas estimates.

Finally, keep in mind that gas prices can be volatile, especially on certain EVM chains. To account for this, it's recommended to include certain buffers (i.e., pay additional gas upfront) to avoid transactions getting ""stuck"" in the pipeline because of out-of-gas issues  (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/pricing>).","","Axelarthumbs (1)"

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","13/07/2023 11:34 am","I hope the team can jump in here with help. Until then, I hope the following helps:

Calling `sendToken` directly on the Axelar Gateway contract should work for transferring tokens between EVM and Cosmos chains. The `sendToken` function is part of the `IAxelarGateway` interface implemented by the Axelar Gateway contract. This function is used to send tokens from one chain to another, including from EVM to Cosmos chains.

Here is the `sendToken` function signature:

```javascript
function sendToken(
 string memory destinationChain,
 string memory destinationAddress,
 string memory symbol,
 uint256 amount
) external;
```

You need to locate the Axelar Gateway contract on the source chain (in your case, Arbitrum), execute `approve` on the source chain (ERC-20), and then execute `sendToken` on the Gateway.

However, please note that the successful execution of this function depends on various factors, including the correct setup of the Gateway contract, the approval of the token transfer, and the correct input parameters for the `sendToken` function.

If your transaction did not go through, it could be due to a variety of reasons, such as insufficient gas, incorrect input parameters, or issues with the Gateway contract. It's good that you've sent a support ticket for further investigation.","",""

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","20/07/2023 4:24 pm","Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP) allows a developer to call any function on any other connected chain. This means you can call a contract on Polygon (chain B) from Avalanche (chain A). However, the docs do not provide specific information on whether the `_execute` function on your Avalanche contract can catch a boolean returned from the Polygon contract. Sorry, I do not know this. I hope the team can jump in here.

The transaction flow involves sending a message from a smart contract on one chain (Moonbeam in the example) to a smart contract on another chain (Avalanche in the example), and updating a property on the latter. The process involves deploying a smart contract to all the EVM chains in the local developer environment, calculating the estimated gas cost of executing the method on the destination chain, invoking a method on the deployed smart contract on the source chain, and finally, the relay services detecting the gas paid on the source chain and executing the smart contract on the destination chain.

If a transaction fails to relay from the source chain into the Axelar network for processing, the Axelarscan UI will show that the transaction has not been `APPROVED`. It will show an option to ""APPROVE"" that will manually resubmit a request to the network. If the transaction fails to get executed on the destination chain, Axelarscan will provide the option for you to either manually execute a transfer on the destination chain or increase gas payment to the gas receiver on the source chain.

As for the payload, the docs do not provide specific information on what it should contain. However, it's reasonable to assume that it would need to include the necessary information for the transaction, such as the name of the function to be called and the parameters to be passed to it.","",""

Transactions using Axelar have costs associated at each stage of their journey, including the source chain, the Axelar network, and the destination chain. These costs are made up of four types:

1. Initiating the transaction on the source chain
2. Processing the transaction through the Axelar blockchain
3. Relaying to the gateway contract on the destination chain
4. Executing the destination smart contract with the payload

To simplify paying for transaction pricing through the pipeline, Axelar has two general solutions:

- For token transfers, a fixed ""relayer fee"" is deducted from the amount of assets being transferred cross-chain.
- For General Message Passing (`callContract` and `callContractWithToken`), a chain-agnostic gas relaying service is implemented to accept gas payments from users on the source chain in its native currency.

All costs can be seen on **Axelarscan** https://axelarscan.io by looking at a specific transaction.

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","07/08/2023 2:45 pm","Axelar provides two ways to handle gas fees for cross-chain transactions:

1. **User Pays Gas on Destination Chain**: The user or application manually pays for the gas on the destination chain. This means that after the cross-chain payload is approved by the Axelar Gateway contract, the user or application needs to send it to the destination dApp or contract and execute it. This execution requires tokens of the destination chain to cover gas fee costs. This can be an inconvenient user experience, as it requires the user to acquire destination-chain and source-chain tokens -> https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/network/flow

2. **Axelar Pays Gas on Destination Chain**: Axelar offers Gas and Executor services to help make this easier. Axelar creates and deploys a smart contract called the Gas Receiver to all connected EVM chains. This Gas Receiver allows the user to pay for all transaction fees required throughout the entire journey of their cross-chain message in a one-time payment on the source chain, in the source chain's native token https://docs.axelar.dev/learn/network/flow

If you want to pay only for the Axelar gas, you can use the `estimateGasFee` method in the AxelarJS SDK to calculate the total cost for you. This method calculates the Network Base Fee and the Execution Fee. The Network Base Fee is the base fee for any transaction and is fixed based on the chains involved. The Execution Fee is variable depending on the chains involved, and the complexity of your `_execute` method https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/pricing","","üëç (2)"

There is a method called `payGasForContractCallWithToken` that allows you to pay gas for relaying the `callContractWithToken`. This method receives any tokens for the relayer fee. However, the paid gas for this method must be in tokens Axelar supports. 

Here is the function signature:

 address refundAddress
) external;

As for the aUSDC token, it is listed as a supported asset on various chains including Ethereum Goerli and Polygon (Mumbai), you should be able to use aUSDC to pay for gas on these chains.

The gas fee amount should be specified in the smallest unit of the token (like wei for Ether). If you're seeing a discrepancy in the order of magnitude, it might be due to this.","",""

2. **Starting Deposit Confirmation Votes**: During a cross-chain asset transfer, relayer services are responsible for starting off the vote for the deposit confirmation.

"880773868548153344",".justindev","11/08/2023 6:22 pm","Hi sers, I hope to get some clarity on fee estimation üôè 

I understand there's a need to pay for gas before making a cross chain call

```ts
function payGasForContractCallWithToken(
    //...other params
    address gasToken,
    uint256 gasFeeAmount,
) external;
```

In our use case, we need to use `aUSDC` as `gasToken` to execute contract `polygon --> ethereum`

I'm not sure though I understand the initial determination of `gasFeeAmount`(which I believe is denominated in `address gasToken`)

To determine `gasFeeAmount`: first, query axelarscan api `getFees` and get something like

```ts
//(simplified)
const result = {
  base_fee: 0.006172214373496391,
  source_base_fee: 0.006172214373496391,
  destination_base_fee: 0.32830787477019413,

  //and some info about tokens involved
  axelar_token: {},
  source_token: {},
  destination_native_token: {},
};
```

QUESTIONS:

1. is `base_fee`, and `destination_base_fee` denominated the same as `source_token` ? - therefore `totalFees = base + souce + dest`

2. if `1` is not the case - is using `token.usd_value` the correct way to denominate everything as `source_token`

```ts
const destinationFee_sourceTokenDenominated =
  destinationFee * (destination_token.usd_value / source_token.usd_value);
```

3.what are `express_fees` ? I feel like it need just be applied if `estimateResult.express_supported = true`

4. in case of `2` is `base_fee` denominated in `axelar_token` ? 

5. is this the case: once I determine the correct gasFee amount I can use this as ff. 
```ts
function payGasForContractCallWithToken(
    //...other params
    ""0x2c852e740b62308c46dd29b982fbb650d063bd07"", //gasToken (aUSDC) address
    6_000_000, // gasFeeAmount (6 aUSDC)

Example of the interchain transfer of NFTs originally minted on the source chain and sent to the destination chain: https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-examples/tree/main/examples/evm/nft-linker

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","14/08/2023 1:22 pm","Yes, you need to pay for gas before making a cross-chain call. (Please see this post for infos on the two ways Axelar provides for handling gas fees https://discord.com/channels/770814806105128977/955655587260170272/1138037782061776936).

The `payGasForContractCallWithToken` function is used for paying gas, where `gasToken` is the token you're using to pay for gas, and `gasFeeAmount` is the amount of gas you're paying. Keep in mind, we only support payments made with native gas tokens as mentioned by Idris from the team here: https://discord.com/channels/770814806105128977/1090343366975291464/1098725310830235668

To determine the `gasFeeAmount`, you need to use the `estimateGasFee` method provided by the AxelarJS SDK. This method gives you an estimate of the appropriate gas payment to be made to the gas receiver on the source chain. Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
const sdk = new AxelarQueryAPI({
 environment: ""testnet"",
});

// Use the estimateGasFee method
sdk.estimateGasFee(/* parameters */);
```
See also the docs here: https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/axelarjs-sdk/axelar-query-api

The `estimateGasFee` method takes into account these parameters: `gasLimit`, `minGasPrice`, and `gasMultipler`. They are used to calculate the total estimated gas required for the cross-chain call. The response to the method gives a single value (in `wei`) of the total estimated gas required for the cross-chain call.

Regarding your questions:

1. The `base_fee`, `source_base_fee`, and `destination_base_fee` are not necessarily denominated in the same token as `source_token`. The fees are calculated based on the chains involved and the complexity of your `_execute` method.

2. The `token.usd_value` might not be the correct way to denominate everything as `source_token`. The `estimateGasFee` method calculates the total cost for you, taking into account the current conversion rates to translate the gas paid on the source chain for the gas cost used by Axelar and the destination chains.","",""

The 3 TokenTypes in the Axelar Gateway contract represent:

1. InternalBurnable - A token that was deployed by the Gateway itself, and implements the IBurnableMintableCappedERC20 interface. This allows the Gateway to directly call the mint and burn functions on the token contract.

2. InternalBurnableFrom - Similar to InternalBurnable, but the token contract also implements burnFrom, allowing the Gateway to burn tokens from any account, not just its own.

3. External - A token that was not deployed by the Gateway, so it doesn't have direct access to mint/burn functions. The Gateway has to use transfer and transferFrom to move these tokens.

It allows the Gateway to handle both its own tokens and arbitrary external tokens in the system.

When integrating other chains, you would need to follow similar patterns - either deploy tokens that the gateway can control, or integrate with external tokens through transfers. The Gateway needs some way to mint/burn tokens that are transferred cross-chain.

When someone calls sendToken on the source chain to send tokens cross-chain, the Gateway on that chain needs to burn those tokens.

The burnToken function is called by the Axelar network to tell the destination Gateway to burn the tokens that were sent.

**Here's a quick breakdown of what it does:
**
- It takes the token symbol and a salt as parameters
- Checks that the token is registered with the Gateway

- If the token type is External:
      - It deploys a temporary DepositHandler contract
      - Transfers the Gateway's balance of that token to the DepositHandler
      - Calls destroy to delete the DepositHandler, burning the tokens

- If the token type is Internal:

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","23/08/2023 10:49 am","Axelar employs a multi-party cryptography scheme where each validator holds a piece of the key, called a key share. Validators agree through their confirmation votes to confirm a deposit and sign a transaction transferring the tokens to the user's address on chain B, which completes the asset transfer. Once enough key shares have agreed, the transaction can proceed.

To enhance security, Axelar has implemented a system of key rotations. Starting from `axelard` `v0.17.3+` and `tofnd` `v0.10.1+`, validators can generate a new `tofnd` mnemonic to slowly rotate out their old `tofnd` mnemonics for improved security. New Axelar key rotations will automatically use the most recent mnemonic generated. A key becomes *old* after `x` subsequent key rotations for that EVM chain. (Currently `x=7`.)

However, it's important to note that Axelar cannot enforce the deletion of old keys by validators. Validators are advised to keep their old `tofnd` mnemonics backed up as these mnemonics are still in use until the keys generated from them are considered ""old"" by the Axelar network. Validators are recommended to have processes in place to rotate their `tofnd` mnemonic once every 2 months.

In summary, while Axelar provides mechanisms for key rotation and encourages best practices, it ultimately relies on the validators to properly manage and delete their old keys.

"761834826533568542","stefan_1","23/08/2023 10:57 am","Here are a few things you might want to check:

1. **Check the arguments you're passing to the functions**: Both `sendToken` and `callContractWithToken` require specific arguments. For `sendToken`, you need to provide the destination chain, destination address, token symbol, and amount. For `callContractWithToken`, you need to provide the destination chain, contract address, payload, token symbol, and amount. Make sure these arguments are correct and in the right order.

2. **Check the token you're trying to send**: Not all tokens are supported by Axelar. You can check the list of supported assets for **Mainnet** https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/mainnet-contract-addresses and **Testnet** https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/reference/testnet-contract-addresses.

3. **Check the gas fee**: Executing these functions requires tokens of the destination chain to cover gas fee costs. If you're using `callContractWithToken`, you can use the `payGasForContractCallWithToken` function to pay the gas fee. Make sure you have enough tokens to cover the gas fee and that you've approved the `AxelarGasReceiver` with the appropriate amount.

4. **Check the contract you're calling**: If you're using `callContractWithToken`, the destination contract address must inherit from `AxelarExecutable`.

If you've checked all these things and you're still having trouble, it might be a good idea to reach out to the Axelar team directly for more specific help.","",""

**Adding a blockchain**
In general, adding a new chain to Axelar is permissionless. It takes about 10 minutes to integrate a new blockchain. Here are the basic steps outlined by Axelar's co-founder Sergey: https://twitter.com/axelarcore/status/1499053636969709568.

**Adding your dApp**
Axelar provides a suite of APIs and an SDK that can be used to add cross-chain functionality to your applications. 

This includes the ability to send messages containing arbitrary data cross-chain, from the source chain to the destination chain. This can be done by interacting with the Axelar Gateway, an Axelar-operated installation on the source chain, which contains the functions and logic needed for initiating and processing any cross-chain messages.

For transferring tokens cross-chain, you can use the AxelarJS SDK. There are three ways to do this:

1. Call `sendToken` on an Axelar gateway EVM contract.
2. Get a deposit address using the AxelarJS SDK.
3. For tokens not natively supported, build your own Interchain Token **source** (<https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/send-tokens/overview>).

Here is an example of how to use the AxelarJS SDK to generate a deposit address:

```javascript
const sdk = new AxelarAssetTransfer({ environment: ""testnet"" });
 
const fromChain = CHAINS.TESTNET.AVALANCHE, 
 toChain = CHAINS.TESTNET.POLYGON,
 destinationAddress = ""0xF16DfB26e1FEc993E085092563ECFAEaDa7eD7fD"",
 asset = ""avax""
 
const depositAddress = await sdk.getDepositAddress({
 fromChain, 
 toChain, 
 destinationAddress, 
 asset
});
```

KYVE has now archived 77250 blocks of Axelar chain on Arweave = 0.05 GB and should be at the latest state in ~108 days.
You can start accessing the data that has already been uploaded to start building & perform data analytics with it.

:arrow: KYVE is a decentralized datalake, archiving data from genesis to the latest state in a decentralized way on any decentralized storage solution like Arweave. You can think of it as a decentralized archival node storing everything in the block and the block result. You can access this data for free since it's on Arweave and permanently stored. You can then query the data using KYVE's ELT pipeline that support more than 50 datawarehouse (Snowflake, Mygraphsqql, SQL, Postgress, etc..) or through Rest API. This data can also be used to block sync or state sync a node (for validators mostly).

:cosmos: KYVE has already archived Cosmos Hub, Archway and are archiving also Osmosis ~22.80%.
