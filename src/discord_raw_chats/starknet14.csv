This channel is dedicated to https://github.com/dontpanicdao/starknet-burner, a javascript library to provide alternative flows to interact with Starknet, like ""pre-signing an authorisation to call a specific contract starknet"". If you want to join, help or just use/test/like, we will try to help.","","👏 (11)"

"896707292576235540","gregoryguillou","28/08/2022 11:31 pm","Right now, the sessionkey is in the browser sessionStore (in memory in case of incognito mode). This is for security reasons because we do not want the js running in the app to access it by default.

Assuming you move the iframe on the same URL as your app you would be able to move to the localStore and persist after restart. Since you limit the plugin to some specific contracts, you could also share the key to a 3rd party server-side actor and you would not have the same problem as with a browser.

This is something we plan to deliver (at least the sent to a cloud service) and it you want it, we can help to have it in the burner....","","🔥 (5)"

"896707292576235540","gregoryguillou","04/09/2022 6:48 pm","No. It is a key manager : dapps can install it and request a signature from their wallet like Argent-X. Once done, you can execute transactions limited in time and scope without signing anymore.","",""
"896707292576235540","gregoryguillou","04/09/2022 6:49 pm","So... not a wallet; a tool to pre-agree on granting some limited access to your wallet","","✅ (10)"

"896707292576235540","gregoryguillou","04/09/2022 6:58 pm","That is right. The idea is that there is a private key that sign transactions in the session store of your browser but that key is different from your wallet private key. Because the key is limited in scope and time the burner will autosign for you yes.","","👍 (4)"

"896707292576235540","gregoryguillou","04/09/2022 8:02 pm","Actually, the way dapps charge has little to do with the wallet or the burner. It is related with the contract behind. #💳｜starknet-burner is a script that is installed in the dapp and at the end, the transaction go through your account. The deal is that you need to ""pre-agree""... 

If you plan to use a paymentAccount that is different from the use account, that is something that I think will come but that depends on the protocol (at least that is the goal of starkware)","",""
