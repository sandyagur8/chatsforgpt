Juno version used is 0.2.2.. 

probably its closed ports matters, but not sure.. is there a way to check logs somehow?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/990189698813149214/1101754805216616468/image.png",""
"830547801032884319","beatroot#6098","29/04/2023 10:45 pm","Hey, no worries, more than glad to help! 😊

1. To check out the logs, just run this: `docker logs <container_name>` (in your case, container name is `starknet-node-starknet-node-1`).

2. It seems that the GLCstaked instructions you followed were for v0.1.0. Since v0.2.0, some flags have changed. You'll need to update the following lines:

```command:
    --db-path=/var/lib/juno
    --verbosity=0
    --network=0
    --rpc-port=6060```
And change them to:
```command:
    --db-path=/var/lib/juno
    --log-level=info
    --network=mainnet
    --rpc-port=6060```

This should help you get your container running smoothly! And if you need more info, just head over to the official Juno readme on GitHub: https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno

Good luck, and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask!","","👍 (6)"
