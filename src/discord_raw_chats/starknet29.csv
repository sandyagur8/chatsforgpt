I personally, do not see the case for doing it:
- why use Juno upstream of Caigo when their code is actually generated from another lib (Go proverb: A little copying is better than a little dependency)?
- I reproduced the `go generate` and the code is huge including several implementations of felt in assembly for various arch (Go proverb: ""Cgo is not Go"")
- And also Go Proverb ""Clear is better than clever"", the implementation we have is just a wrapper on the stdlib. Their is a full reimplementation of Felt with 4 uint64.

Maybe we should open an issue to track this decision. From what I see they are actively developing Juno, their code is good and they are a company. What worries me is that they are not afraid of huge dependencies. As an illustration, I would advocate that a project with a Makefile is too big for me.

A compromise could be to move Felt in a separate package from away from `types` and make sure we share an Interface but yet rely on a current implementation that is a stdlib wrap and allow to change it. I would argue that I need to better understand the benefit and even if they'd be 10x faster, I might not be convinced over the additional complexity. But again, it is doable and not my choice. Lets just make sure Caigo remains simple.","",""
"420477687409278986","tarrence#4186","22/07/2022 8:45 pm","Generally agree with you that their implementation is quite heavy handed. I wonder why they decided to go that route. I think a `[]byte` representation makes more sense than `big.Int` since it is more approachable from a devex perspective. The reason to use it would be to maintain compatibility. Eventually I think Juno will gain traction, since as a node implementation it has/will have a lot more activity and legitimacy. Making them compatible would allow us to avoid things like this: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-starknet/blob/0bdad78661dc27028546180ca5bcead1c9b69076/relayer/pkg/chainlink/ocr2/utils.go#L67","",""

"896707292576235540","gregoryguillou","09/09/2022 2:49 am","Thank  @drspacemn | StarkWare  for this explaination and change. Not everything is in our hands and be aware that it might take time. This is why:

- Pathfinder is moving toward Starknet v0.2.0 JSON-RPC API. Because we are moving fast, the way they provide compatibility is by having the ability to run a node in the previous version. Unfortunately, on Goerli, right now, we cannot use a node that is earlier than v0.3.3 due to some changes on the network and there is at least 1 one blocking issue for `starknet_call` that should be fix with 0.4.x to come

- Starknet JSON-RPC v0.2.0 is not yet fully implemented and we were considering moving forward to implement the API only with the new release. I least I was. That release is from Tuesday.

- Most project are using Goerli as their ""current demonstration"", i.e. is like production. As a result, it is hard for us to have say: (1) 0.3.0 of Caigo that would be ""prod-like"" for mainnet and (2) main of Caigo that would be ""possibly broken on Goerli. Reminder, we can only start our devs when it reaches Goerli right now.

If you need to access Starknet with Go ❤️ . This are a few hints you might want to consider:
- What has been done, is.a good way to start. Get in touch with the people using Caigo in that channel
- For now and because it is more unlikely to change, rely on the gateway that is also part of Caigo. At least for calling contracts
- If you have an issue, you can very easily bypass our type system by running the query through the json-rpc client we use that is the one from go-eth directly on your node. You will love playing with `map[string]interface{}` and `[]interfaces` ... it will feel like javascript and yes, it will break the same way 🤣 
- Do not hesitate to open a PR, even to write a failing test!","",""

Want to help? this is what you should do
- check `main` and do not hesitate to ask questions come with ideas
- Join the Caigo community calls that will be schedule on Monday, the 17th by @Lucas | StarkWare .

The release will contain:
- A shared implementation of an  `Account` that supports TxV0, TxV1 and plugins. It works both with the Gateway and RPC v0.1
- A battle tested Tx v1 implementation for
   - the Gateway
   - RPC v0.1. We have discussed changes with #💻｜devnet  and #🛰｜pathfinder-support-only. People are working/fixing them, see  https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/pull/303 and https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/issues/632 for details.
- A new and cleaned up type systems: 
  - That would allow to implement v0.2 in parallel of v0.1
  - That are protocol specific beyond the `Account`. You can choose your preferred protocol and develop on it. Note that RPC is at the corner and we can almost do as much as with it than with the Gateway... plus it is yours!
-  Tools to help with #💻｜devnet , thank to the feedback from @Rez | Immutable X 
- 3 experimental account contracts based on OZ with deployment scripts
  - A V0 account that works with and without a Proxy
  - A V1 account that works with and without a Proxy
  - A V0 account with support for plugins that works with and without a Proxy
- A merkle tree algorithm that matches the starknet.js implementation with a proof that is fixed in size
- An implementation of a template plugin (caigo library)
- A Go plugin tested with the template plugin and the Argent-X plugin.","","🔥 (5),🚀 (3),❤️ (2),👿 (2),PU_PepeNarutoRun (2),PU_PeepoStrong (2),PU_pepeBreakShirtStrong (2)"

Prior to the StarkNet upgrade a caigo client could connect to Goerli2 as follows:
```
 gw := gateway.NewProvider(gateway.WithBaseURL(""https://alpha4-2.starknet.io""))
account, err := caigo.NewGatewayAccount(<account private key>, <account address>, gw, caigo.AccountVersion1)
```
But since the upgrade the returned account has all transactions rejected with the message “Signature (…, …), is invalid, with respect to the public key …, and the message hash …”.

I have submitted a pull request https://github.com/dontpanicdao/caigo/pull/186 with a fix for this. With this pull request clients can successfully connect as follows:
```
 gw := gateway.NewProvider(gateway.WithChain(""SN_GOERLI2""))
 account, err := caigo.NewGatewayAccount(<account private key>, <account address>, gw, caigo.AccountVersion1)
```
Passing any string which contains ""goerli2"" in either upper or lower case as the chain ID will work.

Please could one of the maintainers have a look at this and let me know if the fix seems reasonable, and if there is anything else I should do to get it merged?","",""
