We also created a migration guide to make the transition from v0 to v1 easier! https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit/migrating-to-contractkit-v1

Finally, we released CLI 1.0.1 to use this updated SDK and also have some added functionality. Read the release notes here: https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/celocli-v1.0.1

Note: the `@celo/utils` and `@celo/base` were required to be redeployed again (both in version `1.2.1`, due to having a different version of web3 (we are using the 1.3.5), which was generating a big impact on the bundle size of the other packages because of dup libs.

Many Web3 projects are not well-documented or have very few educational developer resources. Because of that, learning about—and building on—Web3 platforms can be very challenging compared to Web2. 

To ease that transition, meet Celo Sage—a community-driven program through which the community creates various types of content, including articles, tutorials, and videos to help developers onboard to the Celo ecosystem. In exchange for creating this content, contributors will receive token bounties. 

There is no limit on how much a contributor can earn. With this initiative, we hope to build a community of creators. Check out this post and join the celo-sage channel to learn more.
